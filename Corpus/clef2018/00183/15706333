Hemivertebra resection in the cervical spine. Retrospective study with clinical and radiologic evaluation of hemivertebra resection in children with congenital cervical scoliosis.Assessment of hemivertebra resection in the treatment of congenital cervical scoliosis.To our knowledge, this is the first report on hemivertebra resection in the midcervical spine.Three patients with torticollis due to a cervical hemivertebra were operated on by hemivertebra resection and fusion of the adjacent vertebrae. Resection was performed by a posterior-anterior (-posterior) approach. Mean age at time of surgery was 9 years 3 months. They were retrospectively studied with a mean follow-up of 4.8 years.Mean segmental Cobb angle at the hemivertebra was 29 degrees before surgery, 5 degrees after surgery, and 6 degrees at latest follow-up. Head tilt improved from 17 degrees before surgery to 1 degrees after surgery, and 3 degrees at latest follow-up. Bony fusion was achieved in all cases. There was weakness of the left deltoid muscle in 1 case due to C5 root compression by a facet screw, which resolved completely after revision with change of the screw.Resection of a cervical hemivertebra may be an option in the treatment of congenital cervical scoliosis. A good correction of the local deformity and a complete correction of head tilt are achieved. By early operation in young children, the development of severe secondary deformities in the upper thoracic spine can be avoided.
