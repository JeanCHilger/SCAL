Imaging of cervical and thoracic chordoma. Apropos of 2 cases. Chordoma is a rare tumor in spine. Two cases, exceptional in adolescents, are reported. The clinical evolution is slow and progressive. CT shows a lobulated tumor, precises the degree of vertebral osteolysis and detects intra-tumoral calcifications. MRI is useful to determine especially in high in soft tissues and the vertebral canal. Arteriography is realised in pre-operative time and permits an embolization when the tumor is hypervascularised.
