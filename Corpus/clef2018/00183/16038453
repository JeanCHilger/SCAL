Diagnosis and treatment of multiple-level noncontiguous spinal fractures. To explore the injury mechanism, clinical features and treatment methods of multiple-level noncontiguous spinal fractures (MNSF).The clinical data of 23 patients with MNSF were analyzed retrospectively. There were 15 males and 8 females aging from 13 to 75 years. Five cases missed diagnosis. The locations of the primary injury were cervical region in 3 cases, thoracic region in 7 cases, and thoracolumbar region in 13 cases. The spinal fractures associated with spinal cord injury were 14 cases in the primary injury, and 3 cases in the secondary injury. According to Frankel grade, there were 7 cases of grade A, 1 case of grade B, 3 cases of grade C, 6 cases of grade D and 6 cases of grade E. Sixteen cases were treated by surgical stabilization while 7 cases were treated conservatively.Twenty patients were followed up from 3 months to 4 years with a mean of 11.5 months except three patients. No neurologic deterioration was observed in patients who were treated conservatively or operatively. No wound infection, no implant failure or bone graft nonunion occurred in patients who were treated operatively. Among 17 patients with neurologic deficit before operation, 12 got 1-3 grade improvement of the Frankel grading, 4 remained unchanged and 1 died.The mechanism of MNSF injury is complex, it is easy to miss diagnosis. The patients with spinal injury must be examined carefully and completely. A whole spine radiographic survey should be accomplished if necessary and treatments should be based on the stability of spine fractures and the severity of spinal cord injury.
