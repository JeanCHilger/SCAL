Magnetic resonance imaging of trauma to the thoracic and lumbar spine. The importance of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate 24 patients with injuries to the thoracic, thoracolumbar (T12-L1), or lumbar spine. Correlation of the magnetic resonance imaging findings to surgical therapy and outcome was evaluated, with particular attention to the longitudinal ligaments. The ability of the magnetic resonance imaging to detect the extent of trauma to the spinal cord parenchyma and to the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments was found to be important in guiding the surgical approach to these spine fractures.
