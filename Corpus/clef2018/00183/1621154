Junctional burst fractures. Twenty-two patients with burst fractures in this mechanically and neurologically distinct region (T11-L2) were studied at injury and after acute surgical reduction and stabilization (antikyphosis and ligamentotaxis concept). Canal compromise averaged 42% (10-82%) before surgery, and at follow-up 14% (0-46%), segmental kyphosis 15 degrees (4 degrees-27 degrees) and 3 degrees (0 degree-15 degrees), and vertebral segment height 62% (41-85%) and 86% (60-100%), respectively. Incomplete patients gained an average of 1.8 Frankel subgrades. The described treatment can predictably recanalize the spine, correct deformity, and stabilize neurologic compromise. A significant correlation between postoperative neurologic status and the radiographic criteria under study could not be established.
