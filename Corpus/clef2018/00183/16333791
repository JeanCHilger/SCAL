Evaluation of multiple trauma victims with 16-row multidetector CT (MDCT): a time analysis. Description and time analysis of a 16-row MDCT protocol in the evaluation of multiple trauma patients considering transport, time of scanning, patient positioning, image reconstruction, and image interpretation.Between May and December 2004, 60 multiple trauma patients underwent 16-row MDCT (Sensation, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included serial scanning of the head, spiral scanning of the cervical spine and contrast-enhanced spiral scanning of the thorax/abdomen with multiplanar reformations (MPR) of the thoracic/lumbar spine and the pelvis. All time intervals including transport, patient positioning, scanning, duration of MPR, total time in the examination room, and time to first and final image interpretation were prospectively evaluated. Furthermore, patient characteristics, trauma profiles, and mortality rates were recorded.46 male and 14 female patients (mean age 43.6 years) were enrolled in the study. Time analysis of 16-row MDCT revealed the following results (mean time standard deviation): Emergency room treatment and transport 19.2 +/- 6.7 min, patient positioning 16.5 +/- 6.5 min, scan duration 8.0 +/- 3.3 min, total time in examination room 24.5 +/- 7.2 min, image reconstruction including MPR 32.0 +/- 16.4 min, and time of first (16.4 +/- 4.7 min) and final image interpretation (82.5 +/- 30.4 min). Trauma profiles revealed thoracic injuries in 35/60 patients (58.3 %), head injuries in 23/60 patients (38.3 %), abdominal injuries in 15/60 patients (25.0 %), injuries of the cervical (9/60 patients, 15.0 %), thoracic (12/60 patients, 20.0 %), and lumbar spine (19/60 patients, 31.7 %), pelvic injuries in 13/60 patients (21.7 %), and injuries of extremities in 39/60 patients (65.0 %). The mortality rate was 21.7 %.MDCT provides fast and all-inclusive imaging of multiple trauma patients. With the use of 16-row MDCT technology scanning times of 8 minutes are realistic and first image interpretation can be performed 16 minutes after arrival of the patient in the examination room and 35 minutes after admission in the emergency room, respectively. The duration of all procedures done in the examination room is strongly influenced by positioning maneuvers, whereas final image interpretation depends on image reconstructions including MPR. Beside technical improvements, these circumstances provide the potential to further accelerate the diagnostic process in multiple trauma victims.
