Thoracic cord compression caused by disk herniation in Scheuermann's disease: a case report and review of the literature. We present the case of a 14-year-old male with Scheuermann's disease and significant neurological deficit due to thoracic disk herniation at the apex of kyphosis. He was treated with an anterior decompression, anterior and posterior fusion in the same setting using plate, cage and a segmental instrumentation system. The patient had an excellent outcome with complete neurological recovery.
