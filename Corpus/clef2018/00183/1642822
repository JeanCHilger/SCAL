Sexual activities, concerns and interests of men with spinal cord injury. A representative sample of 79 men with spinal cord injury, drawn from a sampling frame of 661 women and men who reside in the community, was studied in terms of sexual activity, concerns and interests. Participants responded to a questionnaire and rating scales and were physically examined to establish their neurologic status. With respect to eleven other areas of life, sex life ranked the lowest in terms of satisfaction and fifth in terms of importance. Of the sample, 67% reported having had a physical relationship (not necessarily including intercourse) in the past 12 months. Areas of sexual activity about which respondents were most concerned were not satisfying a partner, getting or giving a sexual disease, urinary accidents, and not getting enough personal satisfaction. From among seven topics related to sexuality, the three in which there was greatest interest were methods and techniques to achieve sexual satisfaction, helping a partner cope emotionally with limitations on sexual activity and ability to have children.
