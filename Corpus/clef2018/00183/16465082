Complete recovery of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality and traumatic brachial plexopathy in a young infant falling from a 30-feet-high window. The laxity and elasticity of the infant or child spine may predispose him to cervical spine injury without bony disruption. The term 'SCIWORA' syndrome (Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Abnormalities) is commonly used to characterize this condition. We report a 14-month-old infant who fell from a fourth-story window, with delayed onset of SCIWORA and brachial plexopathy. The infant initially presented with complete limb paralysis, but had a full recovery 6 months later. In contrast to the classical grave prognosis of these two conditions, our case represents one of the few exceptions in the literature with excellent recovery. Corresponding to previous reports, we suggest that the initial normal appearance of the spinal cord and nerve roots on magnetic resonance image may serve as a good prognosticator, regardless of the severity of initial neuroelectrophysiological studies or clinical manifestations.
