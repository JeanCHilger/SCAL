Tumors of the craniocervical junction. In this review, the authors describe the most common tumors of the craniocervical junction and their management. Early recognition is important in view of the unspecific symptomatology and much better surgical results in patients operated before the appearance of neurological deficits. In the last 15 years, different craniobasal approaches have been developed which permit the radical excision of many of these lesions with no or acceptable morbidity. Representative cases are illustrated.
