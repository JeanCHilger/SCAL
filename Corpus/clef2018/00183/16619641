The authors report the case of a 10-year-old boy who sustained an injury to the cauda equina as a result of the accidental penetration of a wooden pencil into the spinal canal. After neuroimaging evaluation to exclude visceral and vascular lesions, the foreign body was removed and the wound was repaired. This is the first report of a cauda equina injury caused by a pencil.
