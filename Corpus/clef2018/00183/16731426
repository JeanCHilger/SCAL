Official positions of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry and Executive Summary of the 2005 Position Development Conference. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) convenes a Position Development Conference (PDC) every two years for the purpose of making recommendations on clinically relevant issues in bone densitometry. Topics for consideration are developed by the ISCD Scientific Advisory Committee and the PDC Steering Committee. Clinically relevant questions related to each topic area are assigned to subcommittees for a comprehensive medical literature review and presentation of a report to an international panel of experts. The expert panel includes representatives of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) and the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF). The recommendations of the PDC expert panel are evaluated by the ISCD Board of Directors, and those that are approved become Official Positions of the ISCD. The Official Positions have subsequently been endorsed by the ASBMR and IOF. The most recent PDC was held July 15-17, 2005, in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Topics considered included technical standardization, vertebral fracture assessment, and application of the 1994 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to various skeletal sites and to populations other than postmenopausal white women. This report describes the methodology of the 2005 PDC and presents a summary of all ISCD Official Positions.
