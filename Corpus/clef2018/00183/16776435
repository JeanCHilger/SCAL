Communicating hydrocephalus and papilloedema associated with intraspinal tumours: report of four cases and review of the mechanisms. Communicating hydrocephalus and/or papilloedema associated with intraspinal tumours is rare. Four such patients are presented in this article. In addition to previous theories put forward to explain this condition, we would like to propose alteration of craniospinal compliance distribution as a possible underlying mechanism. Consequently, we suggest not performing shunt placement immediately if the intraspinal tumour can be removed.
