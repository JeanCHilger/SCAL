Short segment posterior locking cervical plate fixation after kyphectomy for myelomeningocoele-associated kyphosis. We report the use of posterior cervical locking plate fixation after apical vertebral excision for congenital lumbar kyphosis in a 3-year-old male myelomeningocoele patient. At 4-year follow-up the fixation was secure and the correction was well preserved.
