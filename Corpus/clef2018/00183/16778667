The coconut condyle: occipital condylar dysplasia causing torticollis and leading to c1 fracture. In this report we discuss the case of a child who was initially diagnosed at 1 month of age with congenital muscular torticollis. After falling off a slide at 22 months of age, the patient had onset of pain and an abrupt worsening of his torticollis. After a full workup, it was found that the patient had a C1 fracture and a disproportionately large ipsilateral occipital "coconut" condyle. We believe this congenital anomaly to be the cause of his original head tilt and also predisposed him to C1 fracture and worsening head tilt.
