How do C6/C7 tetraplegic patients grasp balls of different sizes and weights? Impact of surgical musculo-tendinous transfers. Prospective control cohort study.To develop a new test to analyse qualitatively grasping strategies in C6/C7 tetraplegic patients, and to quantify the effect of musculo-tendinous transfers.France.Twelve C6/C7 tetraplegic adults (17 arms 31.3+/-7.9 years) and 17 healthy subjects (30.9+/-9.4 years) completed the study. We assessed participants' ability to grasp, move and release standardized balls of variable sizes and weights.Failures, movement duration (MD), grip patterns, forearm orientation during transport.In patients as well as in controls, the number of digits involved in prehension increased proportionally to the size and weight of the ball. C6 non-operated tetraplegic patients failed 38.2% of the tasks. They frequently used supine transport (51.4% of successful tasks). MD was longer, with a large distribution of values. The presence of active elbow extension poorly influenced the amount of failure nor grip configuration, but significantly reduced MD and supine transport (34%). Patients who were evaluated after hand surgery showed a trend towards improved MD and more frequent completion (failure 30%), especially for middle-sized and middle-weighted balls. Grip patterns were deeply modified, and all transports were made in pronation.The 'Tetra Ball Test' evidences the characteristics of grasping in tetraplegic patients and those influenced by surgery. It may be useful in understanding effects of surgical procedures. This preliminary study must be completed to evaluate the quantitative responsiveness and reproducibility of this test and to develop instrumented electronic balls to optimise it.
