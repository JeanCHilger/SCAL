Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma in an 11-month-old girl. An 11-month-old girl was admitted for a 2-month history of regression of motor milestones and lateralizing neurologic findings. Tests for hypercoagulability were all within normal limits except for a moderately elevated fibrinogen level. Urine and blood cultures were negative for growth. Complete MRI of the spine revealed a well-defined extradural inhomogeneous signal intensity extending from C(4) to T(3) suggestive of a subacute hematoma with evidence of evolving hemorrhagic change. There was no evidence of underlying arterial venous fistula or malformation. She underwent a cervicothoracic laminoplasty and evacuation of the hematoma. The clot was confirmed to be a hematoma on pathologic investigation. She made an uneventful recovery with gradual return of neurologic function. This case represents the longest known duration between initial symptoms and definitive management of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma.
