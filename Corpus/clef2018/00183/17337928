Occipito-atlanto-axial dissociation in a child with preservation of life: a case report and review of the literature. We report a case of a survivor of occipito-atlantal dislocation with atlantoaxial subluxation, an injury which is frequently fatal. Children less than 11 years of age appear to be especially vulnerable to these injuries due to their anatomy. The mechanism is alluded to but poorly understood. The literature review highlights the difficulty in confirming dislocation and subluxation based on the metrics of anatomic landmarks.
