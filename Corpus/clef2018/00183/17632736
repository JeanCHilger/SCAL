C2 prosthesis: anterior upper cervical fixation device to reconstruct the second cervical vertebra. Destruction of the second cervical vertebra leads to a highly unstable situation. Reconstruction is difficult because the axis plays a central role in rotatory movements and has a unique function in redistributing axial loads. The axis transfers the axial load of the two lateral masses of the atlas to three surfaces on the third cervical vertebra: the two articular facets and the vertebral body. As reconstruction is difficult and the instability in this region is life threatening, pathological processes are often treated less radically compared to other areas of the cervical spine. However, this more moderate approach may result in worse outcomes and prognoses. This paper presents the development of a new implant (C2 prosthesis) and two illustrative cases describing the implementation of this new implant. The C2 prosthesis provides anterior support and therefore allows a more radical surgical approach.
