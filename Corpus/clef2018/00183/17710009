Factors influencing neck pain intensity in whiplash-associated disorders in Sweden. To investigate if sociodemographic and economic factors, preinjury health status, and collision factors are associated with initial neck pain intensity in whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) in Sweden. The factors of interest were demographic and socioeconomic factors, prior health, and collision factors.A cohort study of car occupants, insured by either of 2 Swedish traffic insurers, age 18 to 74 years, who filed an injury claim and reported WAD after a motor vehicle collision (n=1187) were approached with mailed questionnaires. These contained questions about prior health, details about the collision, and symptoms after the collision. Neck pain intensity was measured on a visual analog scale and categorized into mild pain (0 to 30 mm), moderate pain (31 to 54 mm), and severe pain (55 to 100 mm).Low educational level [odds ratio (OR) 2.8 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-4.5], being sole adult in the family (OR 1.6This study confirms results from a previous study that sociodemographic and economic status, preinjury health status, and collision-related factors are associated with participants' rating of initial neck pain intensity in WAD. The findings are of importance for interpreting and understanding the underlying factors of pain rating.
