Spinal cord injury rehabilitation: the experience of women. Qualitative study.To develop the knowledge base regarding women's experiences of spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation.United Kingdom.Qualitative interviews with 10 women from four regional SCI rehabilitation centres were transcribed verbatim and analysed according to grounded theory.The central psychosocial problem identified for women during SCI rehabilitation was vulnerability. Vulnerability was amplified by lack of privacy within the rehabilitation centre, by negative staff interactions (associated with perceived lack of control and lack of respect) and by women's minority status in the rehabilitation setting, which at times left women feeling marginalized and inferior. Vulnerability was contained by: negotiating privacy and space receiving support and encouragement from staff, other patients and familyThe SCI rehabilitation environment and interactions within it have the potential to influence significantly, either positively or negatively, women's feelings and behaviours as they begin to negotiate a revised identity as a disabled person. There is a need for further research to be carried out in this area in order that women's needs and concerns can be better understood and clinical practice developed accordingly.
