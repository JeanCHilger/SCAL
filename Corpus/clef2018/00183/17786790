Primary spinal epidural extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma mimicking a spinal abscess. Ewing's sarcoma is one of the most common malignant tumors of the skeletal system in children and young adults. It most frequently stems from the long bones of the extremities. However, though uncommon, extraosseous localization can be seen. Epidural extraosseous presentations are extremely rare. In this case, the authors report on the long-term follow-up of a patient with this well-demonstrated, but uncommon localization, and the initial unique presentation of the patient, which clinically and radiologically mimicked a cervical abscess.
