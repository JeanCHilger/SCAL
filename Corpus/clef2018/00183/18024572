Klippel-Feil syndrome and Sprengel deformity combined with an intraspinal course of the left subclavian artery and a bovine aortic arch variant. We present a case of Klippel-Feil syndrome and Sprengel deformity with a bovine aortic arch and an aberrant course of the left subclavian artery in a 14-year-old boy. CT and MR imaging of the neck and upper thorax demonstrated a cervical osseous segmentation anomaly, a left common carotid artery originating from the innominate artery, and a left subclavian artery coursing through the intraspinal space at the C6 through T1 level. Possible embryonic mechanisms and clinical significance of this variant are reviewed.
