Results of Harrington instrumentation in type A and type B burst fractures. Comparisons of the reductions achieved with posterior Harrington instrumentation of 21 type A and 26 type B burst fractures revealed that the percent correction of angular deformity at surgery was significantly higher (type A, 52% versus type B, 65%) and was better maintained at 6 (type A, 13% versus type B, 36%) and 12 months (type A, 0% versus type B, 28%) after surgery in type B fractures (p less than 0.05). Percent correction of anterior compression achieved at surgery was similar for both groups (type A, 33% versus type B, 37%), but maintenance of correction 6 (type A, 9% versus type B, 23%) and 12 months after surgery (type A, 3% versus type B, 23%) also was significantly better in type B fractures (p less than 0.05). Percent correction of sagittal plane displacement immediately following surgery (type A, 71% versus type B, 73%), and 6 (type A, 62% versus type B, 61%) and 12 months after surgery (type A, 60% versus type B, 56%) was the same in both groups. Results of posterior instrumentation of burst fractures appears to be dependent upon the type of burst injury significantly better reductions were achieved and maintained in Denis type B fractures.
