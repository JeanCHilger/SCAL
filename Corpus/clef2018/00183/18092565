Hemodynamic parameters and timing of surgical decompression in acute cervical spinal cord injury. To evaluate the relationship between the severity of cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] grade), presence of neurogenic shock, and timing of surgical intervention. This is a post-hoc analysis from the Sygen multicenter randomized controlled trial.Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data were collected when patients were first assessed in the emergency room (Time A) and at the time of randomization (Time B). Individuals were subdivided by ASIA grade and by the level of the systolic BP (SBP).Only individuals with cervical SCI from the Sygen trial (n = 577) were evaluated. Severe complete SCI (ASIA grade = A) was established in 57% of these patients. A total of 74 (13%) patients with neurogenic shock (SBP < 90 mmHg) at Time A were identified. The SBP increased significantly from Time A to Time B (P < 0.0001). The median time from SCI to surgical intervention, for ASIA A, was 80.9 hours for patients with initial SBP < 90 mmHg and 58 hours for patients with initial SBP > or = 90 mmHg (P = 0.025). Multivariable analysis after adjusting for confounders revealed a statistically significant difference in the time to surgical intervention based on SBP for ASIA A (P = 0.026), yet not for ASIA B or C/D.The presence of neurogenic shock was associated with a delay in the timing of surgical intervention in patients with cervical SCI. Detailed evaluation of autonomic dysfunctions following SCI including cardiovascular instability could improve our understanding of the complexities of clinical presentations and possible neurological outcomes.
