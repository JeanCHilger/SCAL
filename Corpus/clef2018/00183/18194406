Validity, responsiveness, and minimal important difference for the SF-6D health utility scale in a spinal cord injured population. To determine the feasibility, acceptability, discriminative validity, responsiveness, and minimal important difference (MID) of the SF-6D for people with spinal cord injury (SCI).A total of 305 people with SCI completed the SF-36 health status questionnaire at baseline and at subsequent occurrence of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or 6-month follow-up. Normative SF-36 data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. SF-36 scores were transformed to SF-6D utility values using Brazier's algorithm. We used UTI as the external criterion of clinically important change to determine responsiveness and two categories of the SF-36 transition question ("somewhat worse" and "somewhat better") as the external criterion to determine the MID. Derived SF-12 responsiveness was also assessed.The mean SF-6D values were: 0.68 (SD 0.21, n = 305) all patients 0.66 (SD 0.19, n = 167) tetraplegiaThe content of the SF-6D is more appropriate than that of the SF-36 for this physically impaired population. The SF-6D has discriminative power and is responsive to clinically important change because of UTI. The MID is consistent with published estimates for other disease groups.
