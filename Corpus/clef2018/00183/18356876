Mid-line clefts of the cervical vertebrae - an incidental finding arising from cone beam computed tomography of the dental patient. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a rapidly emerging imaging modality in dentistry that offers the advantages of high diagnostic yield with short scanning times and a radiation dose significantly lower than conventional CT. Clinical applications of CBCT are numerous and they are being used both within the hospital and the primary care setting. The need for complete interpretation of CBCT images is essential. This report presents two patients for whom CBCT was carried out for orthodontic related purposes and incidental findings of cervical vertebrae clefts diagnosed. CBCT wherever they are undertaken should be reported by someone who has undergone adequate training in their interpretation particularly when machines using a large field of view are employed.
