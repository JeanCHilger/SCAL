Spinal cord compression by tumor with onset following epidural catheterization. We report the case of a 16-year-old boy with a pelvic tumor who developed signs of spinal cord compression following placement of a lumbar epidural catheter to obtain a percutaneous biopsy. The fact that a catheter had been inserted led us to suspect epidural hematoma as a complication, but surgery revealed that the pelvic tumor had spread to the lumbar epidural space and was causing motor blockade of both legs.
