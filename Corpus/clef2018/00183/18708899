Posttraumatic internal jugular vein thrombosis presenting as a painful neck mass in a child. An uncommon case of a pediatric traumatic internal jugular vein thrombosis is presented. A 7-year-old boy developed severe neck pain after falling from a bunk bed. Initially, the child was diagnosed and treated for a lymphadenitis with a possible abscess formation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and Doppler ultrasound imaging of the neck revealed the presence of an occlusive thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and followed closely over the next year. He had full resolution of his symptoms without the development of complications associated with this injury process. Internal jugular vein thrombosis is an uncommon and potentially life-threatening disorder caused by various conditions. This case illustrates the need for a systematic approach when evaluating neck masses, and internal jugular venous thrombosis should be included in the differential of anterior neck swelling.
