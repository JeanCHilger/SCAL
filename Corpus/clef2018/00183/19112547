Vertebral reinforcement by means of kyphoplasty in the treatment of non-osteoporotic thoraco-lumbar fractures. Study of 40 cases and review of the literature. We present a series of patients with acute thoraco-lumbar fractures in whom we performed balloon vertebroplasty (kyphoplasty), either alone (percutaneous) or combined to posterior transpedicular fusion (open kyphoplasty). We emphasize the possibility of extending the use of kyphoplasty to non-osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and combining this method with traditional posterior fusion procedures.Between 2003 and 2005, 138 patients suffering from thoraco-lumbar acute fractures, were treated in our Department. 87 corresponded to one vertebral level fractures 34 to two levels, and the remaining 17 patients had more than two vertebrae affected. 65 patients (47%) received conservative therapy (rest in bed, physiotherapy, and subsequent progressive mobilization with cast). The remaining ones (73 casesKyphoplasty could constitute an alternative and/or complementary treatment of traditional spinal stabilization-fusion procedures in non osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Therefore, it should be offered, when indicated, as a substantial possible part of the treatment, to the patients suffering from vertebral fractures. Additional advantages of combining kyphoplasty and posterior fusion are the possibility of reducing the number of fused levels (shorter instrumentations), and to perform a 360 degree stabilization-remodeling through a single posterior approach.
