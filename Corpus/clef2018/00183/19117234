Comparison of cervical vertebral separation in the supine and seated positions using home traction units. This study was performed for the purpose of comparing the magnitude of cervical vertebral separation during cervical traction in supine and seated positions using home traction units. A repeated measures design with two within-subject factors (type of traction and time) was used. Seventeen asymptomatic volunteers received cervical traction in seated and supine position. Subjects received 5 minutes of static traction in sitting or supine using a force of 13.6 kg while in 15 degrees of neck flexion. A lateral radiograph of the cervical spine was taken before traction force was applied and after five minutes of static traction. Anterior and posterior distances between the inferior border of C2 and the superior border of C7 were measured by a radiologist. After supine traction there were significant increases (p=0.001) in posterior cervical vertebral separation compared to any changes after seated traction. There were no significant changes in anterior vertebral separation during either supine or seated traction positions (p=0.769). Supine cervical traction may be more effective for increasing posterior vertebral separation than seated cervical traction.
