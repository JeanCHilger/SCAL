An uncommon cause of throat pain. Throat pain is a common presenting complaint in the pediatric emergency department and often occurs secondary to non-life-threatening conditions. Certain etiologies may initially appear benign, but if not recognized and treated, may result in airway compromise. Patients with blunt trauma to the neck may present with throat pain. This is an uncommon pediatric injury usually due to a sharp blow to the anterior neck. This injury is rarely seen in isolation. We present a case of laryngeal injury due to blunt trauma to the neck. This case illustrates the potentially serious consequence after an apparently minor traumatic injury.
