Operative treatment of traumatic fractures of the thorax and lumbar spine. Part II: surgical treatment and radiological findings. The Spine Study Group (AG WS) of the German Trauma Association (DGU) presents its second prospective Internet-based multicenter study (MCS II) for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spinal injuries. This second part of the study report focuses on the surgical treatment, course of treatment, and radiological findings in a study population of 865 patients. A total of 158 (18,3%) thoracic, 595 (68,8%) thoracolumbar, and 112 (12,9%) lumbar spine injuries were treated. Of these, 733 patients received operative treatment (OP group). Fifty-two patients were treated non-operatively and 69 patients were treated with kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty without additional instrumentation (Plasty group). In the OP group, 380 (51.8%) patients were instrumented from a posterior (dorsal) position, 34 (4.6%) from an anterior (ventral) position, and 319 (43.5%) cases with a combined posteroanterior procedure. Angular stable internal spine fixator systems were used in 86-97% of the cases for posterior and/or combined posteroanterior procedures. For anterior procedures, angular stable plate systems were used in a majority of cases (51.1%) for the instrumentation of mainly one or two segment lesions (72.7%). In 188 cases (53,3%), vertebral body replacement implants (cages) were used and were mainly implanted via endoscopic approaches (67,4%) to the thoracic spine and/or the thoracolumbar junction. The average operating time was 152 min in posterior-, 208 min in anterior-, and 298 min in combined postero-anterior procedures (p<0,001). The average blood loss was highest in combined operations, measuring 959 ml vs. 650 ml in posterior vs. 534 ml in anterior operations (p<0,001).Computer-assisted intraoperative navigation systems were used in 95 cases. At the time of hospital admission, 58,7% of the patients had spinal canal narrowing of an average of 36% (5-95%) at the level of their injury. The average spinal canal narrowing in patients with a complete spinal cord injury (Frankel/ASIA A) was calculated to be 70%, vs. 50% in patients with incomplete neurologic deficits (Frankel/ASIA B-D), and 20% in patients without neurologic deficits (Frankel/ASIS E p<0,001). The average procedure in the plasty treatment subgroup was 50 min (18-145 min) to address one (n=59) or two (n=10) injured vertebral bodies. In patients with nonoperative treatment mainly three-point-corsets (n=36) were administered for a duration of 6-12 weeks. During their hospital stay 93 of 195 (44,7%) patients with initial neurologic deficits improved at least one Frankel/ASIA grade until the day of discharge. Two patients (0,2%) showed a neurologic deterioration. The highest rate of complete spinal cord injury (n=36, 23%) was associated with thoracic spine injuries. Nine (1%) patients died during the initial course of treatment. A total of 105 (14,3%) cases with intraoperative (n=56) and/or postoperative complications (n=69) were registered. The most common intraoperative complication was bleeding (n=35, 4,8%). A higher relative frequency of intraoperative complications was noticed in combined (n=34, 10,7%) vs. isolated posterior (n=22, 5,9%
