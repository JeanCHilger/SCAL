Intraspinal neurenteric cysts in children. Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital epithelium-lined cysts of the central nervous system. They are found predominantly in the spinal cord, with lower incidence in the intracranial compartment, and may be associated with various other congenital spinal anomalies. Seven patients with symptomatic intraspinal neurenteric cysts are presented.Seven patients with intraspinal neurenteric cysts aged from nine months to ten years treated at this hospital from May 2000 to July 2006 were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, imaging and surgical findings of patients were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent operation. One patient's cervical neurenteric cyst was resected using the lateral cervical approach, and the other six resections were performed with posterior approach.All seven patients presented with neurological involvement. One patient had an intramedullary cyst, while the other six cysts were situated ventrally. Three patients' cysts occurred in the cervical region, two in the cervicothoracic region, one in the thoracic region and one in the lumbar region. One patient had bony anomalies, and one had a lumbar posterior occult spinal dysraphism. Five patients' symptoms improved rapidly after surgery.Intraspinal neurenteric cysts in children are rare and most occur ventral to the spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most effective imaging modality. Earlier diagnosis and surgical resection of spinal neurenteric cysts improves prognosis.
