Severe tracheobronchial stenosis and cervical vertebral subluxation in X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata. Radiologic manifestations of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX1) typically include chondrodysplasia, epiphyseal stippling, punctate calcification of cartilage, distal phalangeal hypoplasia, and nasal/midface hypoplasia. We present an infant with CDPX1 demonstrating calcification and stenosis of the entire trachea and mainstem bronchi, as well as possible anterior C1 subluxation due to progression of congenital vertebral dysplasia.
