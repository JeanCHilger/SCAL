Os odontoideum with posterior atlantoaxial instability. Nine patients who had os odontoideum with posterior atlantoaxial instability are reviewed. Three parameters were measured on the lateral radiographs: the distance from the os odontoideum to the spinous process of the axis in extension (Dext), the distance from the os odontoideum to the posterior arch of the atlas (Datl), and the degree of instability (Inst). Patients were classified into four groups: Group I, local symptoms (N = 3) Group II, transient myelopathy (N = 0)
