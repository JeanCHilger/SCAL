MR-imaging of chronic spinal cord injury. Association with neurologic function. Twenty-two para- and tetraplegic patients with chronic spinal cord injuries were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The clinical course in the entire rehabilitation period was recorded and an attempt was made to associate the functional status of the patients with the morphologic findings on MRI. Small and large spinal cord cysts and syringomyelia, cord atrophy, and spinal stenosis were found. Additionally, in a number of patients regions of increased signal intensity within the cord, interpreted as myelomalacia, and obliteration of the intradural extramedullary space, interpreted as arachnopathy, were noted. The large number (13/22) of cystic lesions in our patients was unexpected. It was in contrast to the rate reported in autopsy studies of paraplegics which note only few cysts. Whereas a direct association of morphologic findings with neurologic symptoms and the clinical course was difficult, it was found that patients with large cysts and spinal cord atrophy generally showed no tendency to improve in spite of the measures taken during the rehabilitation period. It is difficult to decide whether the initial trauma with cord hemorrhage is limiting the chance of neurological improvement or if a sequence of events leading from hemorrhage to gliosis and cystic necrosis is the determining factor.
