Neurogenic urinary bladder in patients with spinal cord injury. Protocol of surveillance and management. Bladder dysfunction is constant in patients with spinal cord injury and this whatever is the injury level. They are characterized by a variable profile and changing in the course of the years. They constitute not only, an important cause of morbidity in this population but also mortality.The aim of this work is to emphasize the importance of the diagnosis and to study the bladder behaviour while clarifying the evolution of this type of bladder and to present a protocol of management of a neurogenic bladder.retrospective study. 2 assessments in 6 months of interval were realized. The bladder evaluation consisted in a biological assessment, a urinary ultrasound, a cystography and urodynamic investigations. The management is initially realized there to hospital.Our study contains 62 persons with spinal cord injury of average age of 32, 4 years with post traumatic period average is of 41, 47 months. The various evaluations allowed us to conclude that there is a significant change of the neurological status as well as the urinary biological values with significant deterioration of the various ultrasound, cystography and urodynamic data.The diagnosis and the management of the neurological bladders of persons with spinal cord injury have to be besides the other deficiencies that these patients as well as neurological, orthopaedic, and cutaneous devices, because this is going to allow to improve their quality as well as their life expectation. Our results underline the importance and the necessity to establish a protocol of neurogenic bladder control rigorous and codified which remains to adapt according to every patient. This protocol is sometimes difficult to apply given the fact of the misunderstanding of this type of deficiency.
