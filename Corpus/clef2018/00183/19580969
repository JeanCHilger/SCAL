Lumbosacral dislocation: a review of the literature and current aspects of management. Lumbosacral fracture dislocation is a very rare lesion and was first described by Watson-Jones in 1940. Two anatomical classifications are described in the literature, all other reports are case presentations. This fracture type is characterised by an antero- or retrolisthesis or a lateral translation of the 5th lumbar vertebra in relation to the sacrum. Biomechanics are discussed controversially. Most patients suffer from a high energy trauma with concomitant severe injuries. There is a high rate of additional neurological deficits. Fractures of the transverse process are thought to be sentinel fractures. MRI and CT scans are essential to detect the whole extent of the lesion. Circumferential fusion is recommended by several authors to regain stability at the lumbosacral junction.
