Comparative study of various dorsal stabilization procedures in recent fractures of the thoracic spine. After giving a brief summary describing the development of different methods for stabilisation of traumatic spine fractures the authors discuss their own results on 125 patients, who were treated between January 1st 1983 and September 15th 1988. The different surgical procedures (Harrington-instrumentation, transpedicular osteosynthetic stabilisation, fixateur interne) are compared. In the neurological physical examination 25% of the patients improved at least one degree in the Frankel-scale. In four patients there was worsening of the neurological findings. The radiological postoperative studies analyzed the angles of kyphosis and scoliosis within the traumatized spine segments. In overall-comparison of surgical procedures the fixateur interne showed best results (repositional loss of kyphosis angle 6.8 degrees, no fracture instability). Worse results were found for Harrington-stabilisation (repositional loss 9.1 degrees, fracture instability in three cases) and for transpedicular osteosynthetic stabilisation (repositional loss 12.4 degrees, fracture instability in two cases). In conclusion the authors describe the possible different complications for the three methods of judging from the clinical aspect and propose the following standard way of procedure: Fusion of the vertebral bodies with a stable implant and the possibility for intraoperative repositioning, postero-lateral spongiosa-grafting, fusion of the vertebral arc joints, transpedicular spongiosal filling of the traumatized vertebral body, resection of traumatized tissue from intervertebral discs and intercorporal blocking.
