Translaminar screw fixation of a kyphosis of the cervical and thoracic spine in neurofibromatosis. The spinal manifestations of neurofibromatosis include cervicothoracic kyphosis, in which scalloping of the vertebral body and erosion of the pedicles may render conventional techniques of fixation impossible. We describe a case of cervicothoracic kyphosis managed operatively with a vascularised fibular graft anteriorly across the apex of the kyphus, followed by a long posterior construct using translaminar screws, which allow segmental fixation in vertebral bodies where placement of the pedicle screws was impracticable.
