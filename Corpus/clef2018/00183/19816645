Imaging findings of chronic subluxation of the os odontoideum and cervical myelopathy in a child with Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome after surgery to the head and neck. Although uncommon, fractures of the os odontoideum are known to occur in children under 7 years old, following acute trauma.We report a case of chronic subluxation of the os odontoideum resulting in cervical myelopathy in a child with Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome after surgery to the head and neck.The patient was initially put in a Halo vest, following which occipital cervical fusion was performed.Subluxations and fractures at the odontoid synchondrosis are rare but should be anticipated in young children with risk factors for instability of the cervical spine.
