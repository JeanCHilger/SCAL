Use of isocentric fluoroscopy during transoral odontoidectomy. The intra-operative isocentric C-arm (Siremobil Iso-C 3D Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) allows for the acquisition and immediate interpretation of multiplanar three-dimensional images. The utility of isocentric fluoroscopy in surgery of the spine has been well described, in patients with percutaneous kyphoplasty, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, fracture repair, as well as in percutaneous instrumentation at cervical, thoracic and lumbar levels. Two patients who underwent transoral odontoidectomy are presented in whom isocentric fluoroscopy was utilized to provide an intra-operative CT scan. Use of this technology allowed the surgeon to detect residual bone peri-operatively, thus allowing for a more extensive decompression and excellent clinical results. Intra-operative isocentric fluoroscopy in transoral odontoidectomy allows for peri-operative detection of residual bone fragments and intra-operative confirmation of complete decompression.
