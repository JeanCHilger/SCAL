An unusual combination of a lumbar seat belt injury and hemorrhagic contusion of the lower thoracic cord in a 2-year-old child: a case report. We describe a previously unreported combination of lumbar flexion-distraction ligamentous disruption and incomplete thoracic spinal cord injury in a 2-year-old boy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar spine showed hemorrhagic cord contusion at the T11-T12 level. Plain radiographs showed mild kyphosis of the L3-L4 segment. Fluoroscopy showed pathological motion at L3-L4 in flexion indicating a ligamentous injury. The lumbar spine was surgically stabilized and at 1-year follow-up, a remarkable neurological recovery was noted. We believe that physicians managing children with multiple trauma injuries should be aware of this rare type of injury that might be underdiagnosed.
