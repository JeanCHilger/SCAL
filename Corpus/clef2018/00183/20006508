Morphometry of the thoracolumbar vertebrae in sickle cell disease. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who have deformities and vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis may require surgery. Spinal surgeons must become familiar with the vertebral morphometry of patients with SCD and to that aim we have examined the morphometry of the thoracolumbar spine in these patients. A cohort of 100 patients with SCD was examined using plain thoraco lumbar anteroposterior/lateral radiographs and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Vertebral morphometry (vertebral body diameters, pedicle, spinal canal and deformity) was assessed for different age groups. Results were compared to published studies of healthy subjects. The vertebral dimensions for the 16-20-year and the 21+-year-old groups were significantly smaller for females than males at most spinal levels, while measurements in the 6-10 years and 11-15 years age groups were similar across both sexes at most levels. No significant statistical difference was found between the diameters of the right and left pedicles. With the exception of the sagittal diameter, most of the dimensions of the vertebral bodies measured in SCD patients were less than those of healthy individuals multiple deformities were also observed. Low bone density was noted in 32 patients. Our data highlight the differences in vertebral bone mineral density, anatomy and deformities in patients with SCD compared to healthy individuals. When considering surgical intervention for patients with SCD, it is important that pre-operative radiography and planning is undertaken, and that the surgeon is familiar with the geometry of the pedicles of the thoracolumbar vertebrae necessary for the safe insertion of pedicle screws. Osteoporosis must be considered when planning surgical interventions in these patients.
