'Cases against KiSS': a diagnostic algorithm for children with torticollis. In 1991, Biedermann coined the term "kinetic imbalance due to suboccipital strain" ("KiSS-syndrome"). He assumed a functional abnormality of the suboccipital-high cervical spine, resulting in positional preference of the infants head. A broad spectrum of symptoms and complaints have been attributed to "KiSS-Syndrome". Patients are advised to undergo manual therapy, with pressure applied locally in order to readjust the cervical spine. Life threatening side-effects have been published repeatedly. We present two infants with brain tumours who developed torticollis and further neurological findings such as ataxia and reflex differences. In both cases, symptoms caused by the tumour were interpreted as "KiSS-syndrome", and appropriate diagnostics and therapy were delayed for months. There is no scientific evidence for the actual existence of "KiSS-syndrome" as a clinical entity or for the positive effects of manual therapy. Approximately 12% of all infants <12 months show a positional preference of the head, about 8% present with body asymmetry. Whereas most cases are benign, there is a long list of serious differential diagnoses for torticollis in infants. We give an updated review of the literature regarding "KiSS-Syndrome" and discuss the differential diagnostics in infants with torticollis.
