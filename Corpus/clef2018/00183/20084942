Surgical treatment and classification of multiple-level noncontignous thoracolumbar fractures. To explore the surgical treatment and classification of multiple-level noncontiguous thoracolumbar fractures.From December 2005 to December 2008, 24 patients with multiple-level noncontignous thoracolumbar fractures were treated by surgical operation included 16 males and and 8 females with a mean age of 36 years old ranging from 18 to 63 years. According to the ASIA grade of spinal nerve function there was 1 case in grade A, 2 cases in grade B, 2 cases in grade C, 8 cases in grade D and 11 cases in grade E. Based on the modified classification of multiple-level noncontiguous spinal fractures (MNSF) there were 15 cases of type A,9 of type B. The fracture involved 48 vertebraes ranged from T6 to L4. Radiographic data were analyzed retrospectively.All patients achieved surgical treatment without missed diagnosis or delayed diagnosis. All cases were followed up for from 3 to 36 months (means 18.3 months). All cases achieved bone fusion, without significantly lose of the vertebrae body height and implant failure. Among 13 patients with spinal nerves injuries before operation, 11 got more than one grade improvement of the ASIA grading, 2 remained unchanged.The traditional classification methods are improved to guide treatment. The treatment of multiple-level noncontiguous thoracolumbar fractures should be determined according to the severity of spinal cord injury, the stability and the types of spine fractures.
