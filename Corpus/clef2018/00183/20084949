Surgical treatment and effect observation of cervical intraspinal benign neoplasms. To investigate the diagnosis, surgical procedure and clinical outcome of cervical intraspinal benign neoplasm.Twenty-two cases confirmed pathologically were reviewed included 16 males and 6 females with an average age of 43.8 years old ranging from 18 to 56 years. Symptoms mainly included neck pain, numbness and weakness of the extremities, urinary and fecal incontinence, pyramid signs, etc. All underwent X-ray, CT and MRI, 11 cases were diagnosed as neurilemomas, 4 neurofibromas, 3 spinal meningiomas, 2 intraspinal cysts and 2 lipomas. The tumors were removed completely in 18 cases, above 60% in 3 cases and 25% with biopsy in 1 case. Cervical stability in 11 cases was restored after removal of tumors.All were followed-up for from 6 to 84 months(means 12.5 months). Symptoms improved in 20 cases and stable in 1 case and worsened in 1 case postoperatively according to JOA scoring system. Two patients recurred and were treated with second surgery. JOA scoring was (6.52 +/- 1.10) before operation, (11.42 +/- 0.79) after operation, there was statically significance (t = 21.38, P < 0.001). The average recover ratio of total was (46.7 +/- 2.46)%, cervical stability was (62.37 +/- 3.58)%, the other methods was (41.21 +/- 4.63)%. The results of JOA were excellent in 18 cases, good in 2, fair in 1 and poor in 1.The surgical exairesis for cervical intraspinal benign neoplasm has low post-operative recurrence. The main reason of recurrence is not removed the tumor completely. MRI is regarded the effective method which is helpful in differential diagnosis and surgery guidance.
