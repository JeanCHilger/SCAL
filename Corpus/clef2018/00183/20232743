Application of spiral CT reconstruction in the forensic identification of atlantoaxial injuries. To evaluate diagnostic value of spiral CT reconstruction in atlantoaxial injuries.The images of 25 cases of spiral CT reconstruction were analyzed and compared with images of CT scan and X-ray.In 7 cases of odontoid process fracture, X-ray demonstrated 4 cases and CT demonstrated 5 cases, whereas the spiral CT reconstruction diagnosed 7 cases, which could display the displacement of fracture clearly. The X-ray and CT showed asymmetric space between left and right gaps of atlantoaxial joint in 6 cases, while spiral CT reconstruction showed normal and excluded the possibility of atlantoaxial dislocation. There was one case of lateral atlantoaxial joint dislocation, which was demonstrated by the spiral CT reconstruction clearly but not by the X-ray and CT scan. There were 3 cases of atlantoaxial congenital deformity (1 case of absence of both posterior arch of atlas and odontoid process and 2 cases of maldevelopment of the odontoid process), which were displayed clearly by spiral CT reconstruction, but misdiagnosed as odontoid process fracture and atlantoaxial subluxation by X-ray and CT scan.Spiral CT reconstruction can provide the most accurate and integrity imaging information and is very useful in the diagnosis of atlantoaxial injuries and deformity.
