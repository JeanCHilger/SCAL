Kimmerle's anomaly as a possible causative factor of chronic tension-type headaches and neurosensory hearing loss: case report and literature review. Kimmerle's anomaly also known as ponticulus posticus is a common anatomical variation of the atlas, the first cervical vertebra. It is the product of the complete or incomplete ossification of the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane over the vertebral artery groove resulting in the formation of a foramen (arcuate foramen) containing the vertebral artery and the posterior branch of the C-1 spinal nerve. This variation has been associated with vertebro-basilar insufficiency symptoms, various types of headaches, and acute hearing loss. The aim of the present study is to substantiate whether Kimmerle's anomaly is the possible cause of chronic tension-type headaches and neurosensory-type hearing loss in a patient with a known history of headaches and accompanied unilateral hearing loss. The headaches demonstrated the characteristics of the chronic tension-type the audiometric investigation concluded the hearing loss to be of the neurosensory type
