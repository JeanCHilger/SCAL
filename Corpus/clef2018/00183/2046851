A case report: intraspinal canal osteochondroma at the cervicothoracic junction causing spinal cord compression. Osteochondromas are one of the most common benign tumors. They typically develop on long, tubular bones, only rarely compressing the spinal cord. We report the case of a 9-year-old boy who suffered paraparesis secondary to a cervical osteochondroma based at the vertebral body. The tumor was removed using laminectomy. CT scanning, plain X-ray films, and MR imaging were used in the preoperative assessment of the lesion and the operative method.
