Spinal cord injury from spontaneous epidural hematoma: report of 2 cases. Two cases of acute spinal cord injury resulting from spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma are reported, both of which had a cavernous vascular malformation origin. Both spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma and intramedullary cavernous malformation are rare in children. In the pediatric emergency setting, spontaneous epidural hematoma should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis for acute extremity weakness and paresthesia. Immediate magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine as well as prompt neurosurgical consult is recommended for the best chance of improved outcome.
