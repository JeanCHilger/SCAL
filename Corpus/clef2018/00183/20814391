Imaging of acute spinal injury. The mechanism location and type of injury varies according to patient age and severity of trauma. The imaging work-up with radiographs, CT and MRI must be adapted to each individual case. In the setting of minor trauma, standard radiographs are obtained when clinically indicated. In all other cases of high energy trauma, spinal trauma with neurological deficit or incomplete or difficult standard radiographic evaluation, CT will be indicated for osseous injuries while MRI will provide optimal evaluation of soft tissues. Dislocations require immediate treatment. The imaging work-up should by no means delay management. Significant sprains are rare. Several diagnostic pitfalls occur at both extremities of life.
