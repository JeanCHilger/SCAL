Paraplegia after isolated rupture of the spinal cord - a rare injury. Complex vertebral fractures can lead to injury of the spinal cord with resulting paraplegia. High-speed accidents are common causes, especially in younger patients. Malignant or inflammatory processes play an important role in the elderly. Less common reasons for a spinal cord injury are congenital malformations. We here report about a 17-year-old patient who suffered from paraplegia after an isolated rupture of the spinal cord without an injury of the vertebral bodies, intervertebral disc or ligamentous structures. This type of injury has not been reported in the literature before.We report about a 17-year-old patient, referred to our hospital, presenting with lumbal paraplegia after a high-speed accident 8 days prior to admission. After initial stabilisation of the polytraumatised patient, he was referred to our hospital for further treatment.The radiological examination showed a bilateral acetabular fracture, a right anterior pelvic ring fracture and shaft fractures of the left humerus and right femur. Furthermore, the spinal cord at thoracic level 10/11 was ruptured. Interestingly, there was no injury of the vertebral bodies, intervertebral disc or ligamentous structures. A tethered cord as a possible anatomic variation could be excluded in this case by MRI. However, anatomic variations could be the reason for this injury and should be kept in mind.
