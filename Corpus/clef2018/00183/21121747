Osteoid osteoma of the first 2 cervical vertebrae. Report of 4 cases. Osteoid osteoma affects the spine in only 10% of cases. More than 50% of the spinal cases involve the lumbar and cervical vertebrae. Involvement of C-1 and C-2 vertebrae has previously been reported only very rarely in the published literature. The authors report 4 cases of upper cervical osteoid osteoma, 1 involving C-1 and the other 3 C-2, and they discuss different aspects of management in similar cases. The patients were 14, 17, 35, and 46 years old, and all presented with neck pain and various degrees of painful limitation of head rotation not ameliorated by ordinary analgesics. Radionuclide isotope bone scans, CT scanning, and MR imaging were helpful preoperative diagnostic modalities. The first attempt at eradication of the lesions failed in 2 cases and the lesions could be excised totally at a second approach. Postoperatively, the patients all became pain free and gained full range of neck motion. There has been no tumor recurrence and no sign of instability in short- to medium-term follow-up. Among the several etiologies mentioned for neck pain and torticollis, osteoid osteoma of the first 2 cervical vertebrae should be considered as a possible but rare cause. Even though different kinds of management have been mentioned for osteoid osteoma, resection of the lesion remains the best option for achieving a cure.
