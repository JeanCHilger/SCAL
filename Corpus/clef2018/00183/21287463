Epidemiology of traumatic spinal injury: a descriptive study. Acute injuries of the spine and spinal cord are among the most causes of severe disability and death after trauma. Data about spine fracture with or without cord damage are different. The aim of this study was to determine epidemiology and demographics of spinal injury in main trauma center, Guilan, an Iranian province. The present study was a descriptive study of all cases of traumatic spine injury. Who were admitted to Poursina Hospital, main trauma center of Gilan. The scoring Systems used to evaluate severity of injury were American Spinal Injury association (ASIA) and The Injury Severity Score. Among a total of 245 cases, 71.8%were male and 28.2% were female. Male/Female ratio was 2.55:1. The most common age group at which spinal injury occurred in males was 25-44year-olds and in females was 45-64 year olds. The most common causes were motorcycle vehicle accidents and falls. The most common fracture in spine was thoracolumbar (T10-L2). Among forty four of patient with abnormal findings on neurological examination, fifteen of them had complete spinal cord injury (class A of ASIA) and twenty nine of them had incomplete spinal cord injury (class B, C, D, of ASIA). Our focus on the spinal injury and its major etiology revealed that efforts should be made to prevention. More detailed information about the causes of spinal injury should be sought as it might lead to more targeted intervention.
