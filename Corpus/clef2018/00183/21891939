Use of O-arm for spinal surgery in academic institution in India: experience from JPN apex trauma centre. There is a relatively high incidence of screw misplacement during spinal instrumentation due to distortion of normal anatomy following spinal trauma. The O-arm® is the next-generation spinal navigation tool that provides intraoperative 3-D imaging for complex spine surgeries. In this prospective study over 1-month period, 25 patients (mean age 29.16 years (range 7-58 years), 22 (88%) males) with spinal injury who underwent spinal instrumentation under O-arm® guidance were included. Fall from height (64%) was the most common etiology seen in 16 patients. The majority (68%) had dorsolumbar fractures. Spinal canal compromise was seen in 21 patients (84%). Ten patients (40%) had American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade A injuries, two patients (8%) had grade B, five patients (20%) had grade C, four patients (16%) each had grade D, and grade E injuries. A total of 140 screws were inserted under O-arm guidance. Of these, 113 (81%) were dorsolumbar pedicle screws, 2 were odontoid screws, 12 were anterior cervical screws, and 12 screws (48%) were lateral mass screws. Mean duration of surgery was 4.5 h with a mean blood loss of 674 mL. The mean postoperative stay was 6.3 days. None of the patients had screw malplacement ort canal breach. No patient deteriorated in ASIA grade postoperatively. The system was rated as excellent for ease of use by all faculty using the system. Accurate screw placement provides better patient safety and reduces the in hospital stay thereby leading early patient mobilization and may reduce the cost incurred in patient management.
