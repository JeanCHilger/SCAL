Treatment of invasive cervical resorption with sandwich technique using mineral trioxide aggregate: a case report. This article presents two cases of large invasive cervical resorption (ICR) with maintenance of pulp vitality after treatment with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) in a sandwich technique.Invasive cervical resorption is a relatively uncommon but aggressive form of external resorption, primarily caused by dental trauma or injury of the cervical periodontal attachment. The resorptive process does not penetrate into the root canal, and the pulp is not involved in the first phase of the resorption. This feature differentiates external resorption from internal resorption. In most cases, invasive cervical resorption is found during routine radiographic or clinical examination. Different materials have been proposed for the treatment of external cervical resorption. Therapy can be effective when it 1) removes the etiological factors and 2) interrupts the progressive resorption mechanism.The key learning points of this article are the following: treatment strategy to arrest the cervical resorption process and to prevent further resorption without changing pulpal vitality and successful seal of invasive cervical resorption defect using MTA with a sandwich technique.
