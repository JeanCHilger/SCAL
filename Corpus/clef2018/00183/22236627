Follow-up of the sagittal spine by optical technique. Report the use of an optical technique for individual monitoring of the sagittal morphology of the spine in an upright position while avoid irradiation.The series consists of 15 asymptomatic subjects and 326 cases with spinal disorders. Sagittal analysis is expressed by the global trunk tilt (GTT), the intensity of the curves and their level of inflection.The confidence interval is 2 to 3Â° and 3 to 6mm according to the parameters. A significant correlation was observed for the global axis measured by optical or radiological techniques. Variations in intensity and proportion of thoracic and lumbar sagittal curves were observed according to the disease, as well as their evolution over a period of 5 to 30 months. Various "strategies" of adaptation have been observed during repeated examinations.This non-radiating technique allows to be repeated after initial X-rays, for regular monitoring of a disturbance or a therapeutic effect. Its understandable imaging allows the patient to be aware of his situation.This optical technique is reliable and safe for monitoring the sagittal balance while helping further therapeutic target.
