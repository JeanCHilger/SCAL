Zoledronic acid improves bone mineral density in pediatric spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with rapid and sustained bone loss and increase risk of fracture. Disuse is the primary cause for bone loss, although neural and hormonal changes may also contribute via different mechanisms. Bisphosphonates are used widely to treat osteoporosis in adults and are used increasingly for primary and secondary osteoporosis in children. Current data are insufficient to recommend routine use of bisphosphonates for fracture prevention in adult patients post-SCI and there are no available data in pediatric SCI. We report a 12-year-old boy with non-traumatic SCI who was treated with six monthly zoledronic acid (0.05 mg/kg/dose) for 18 months. The patient (AA) was diagnosed with transverse myelitis at 8.1 years of age, resulting in ventilator-dependent incomplete C3 tetraplegia. Following a fragility fracture to the surgical neck of the right humerus at 9.5 years of age, he was started on zoledronic acid. Bone turnover decreased and bone densitometry data (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] and peripheral quantitative computed tomography [pQCT]) showed improvement in metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone mineral content (BMC), volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), and size, after 18 months of treatment. In the growing skeleton post-SCI, zoledronic acid potentially increases vertebral and long-bone strength by preserving trabecular bone (increased BMC and vBMD) and increasing cortical vBMD and cross-sectional area (CSA).
