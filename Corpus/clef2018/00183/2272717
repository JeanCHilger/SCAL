Effect of intravesical instillation of varying doses of verapamil (20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg) upon urinary bladder function in chronic traumatic paraplegics with overactive detrusor function. The effect of intravesical instillation of verapamil was studied in eight chronic, traumatic paraplegics. Cystometry was performed before and 2 h after intravesical instillation of 20 mg of verapamil. After a gap of 10 days, the study was performed with 40 mg of verapamil and after an interval of another 10 days, the effect of intravesical instillation of 80 mg of verapamil was studied. No side-effects were observed after the intravesical administration of 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg of verapamil. The intravesical volume at detrusor reflex activity or at first uninhibited detrusor contraction (IV-DR) showed no significant change after intravesical instillation of 20 mg but IV-DR increased from 90 +/- 22 ml to 131 +/- 21 ml (p less than 0.001) after intravesical instillation of 40 mg of verapamil. There was a significant increase in IV-DR from 96 +/- 23 ml to 242 +/- 35 ml after intravesical instillation of 80 mg of verapamil (p less than 0.001). There was no significant change in detrusor pressure at detrusor reflex activity or at first uninhibited detrusor contraction after intravesical instillation of 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg of verapamil. The frequency of voiding recorded before and one day after intravesical instillation of either 20 mg or 40 mg of verapamil showed no significant change. But the frequency of voiding recorded before and one day after intravesical instillation of 80 mg of verapamil showed a significant decrease from 19 +/- 2 to 8 +/- 1 (p less than 0.001).
