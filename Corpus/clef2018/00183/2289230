Functional radiographic examination of the cervical spine in patients with post-traumatic headache. The segmental extension-flexion motion of the cervical spine and the overall C1-C7 motion were measured on functional X-rays in 19 patients with post-traumatic headache and 19 age- and sex-matched controls. The extension-flexion C1-C7 motion was reduced in patients with post-traumatic headache due to reduced motion in three segments: C2-C3, C5-C6 (p less than 0.05), and C6-C7 (p less than 0.01). In both groups a negative correlation between the C1-C7 motion and age was found, but the regression coefficients were different. Only in the control group could a negative correlation between segmental motion and age be demonstrated. In the patients with post-traumatic headache a statistically significant negative correlation between the log (pain index) and the age-corrected C1-C7 motion was found (p less than 0.04). On the segmental level a negative correlation between the log (pain index) and the age-corrected C1-C2 and C5-C6 motion could be demonstrated (p less than 0.05). Regarding C6-C7 there was a tendency to negative correlation. Furthermore, a negative correlation between the frequency of associated symptoms (dizziness, visual disturbances and ear symptoms) and the age-corrected C5-C6 motion was found. Consequently the decrement of motion primarily affected C2-C3, C5-C6, and C6-C7, whereas the analysis of correlation with pain index indicated C1-C2 and C5-C6 (C6-C7) as the most important segments involved.
