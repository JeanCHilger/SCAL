The use of inside-outside screws for occipitocervical fusion in pediatric patients. The authors describe the use of inside-outside occipital screws in 21 children with occipitocervical instability requiring occipitocervical fusion.The ages of the patients were from 2 to 15 years, and patients presented with a variety of causes of occipitocervical instability, including congenital disorders, posttraumatic instability, idiopathic degeneration, and postoperative instability. Surgeries frequently included foramen magnum decompression, duraplasty, and laminectomy, but all patients required occipitocervical instrumentation and arthrodesis. Postoperative orthosis included the use of either a cervical collar or halo device. In all but one case, patients were followed postoperatively for at least 12 months.The mean age of patients was 9.93 years. Inside-outside screws were used in all reported cases. Rib autograft was used in all patients. In addition, demineralized bone matrix was used in 2 cases, and bone morphogenetic protein was used in 2 patients. Two patients required halo placement, and the other 19 were placed in cervical collars. The average time postoperative orthotics were used was 2.82 months. Arthrodesis was determined radiographically and was noted in all patients. No operative complications were noted however, postoperative complications included 1 wound infection, 2 cases of hardware loosening, and the need for tracheostomy in 2 patients.Inside-outside screws were found to be a useful component of occipitocervical instrumentation in pediatric patients ranging from 2 to 15 years of age. Arthrodesis was demonstrated in all cases.
