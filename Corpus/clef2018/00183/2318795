Cervical myelopathy: MRI evaluation of cord compression. In order to assess the consequences of cervical spinal cord compression in cervical myelopathy, MRI measurements of the sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal cord were obtained in 50 normal volunteers and 50 patients suffering from cervical myelopathy. Whatever the degree of stenosis, the values obtained in the latter group are significantly inferior to those of the normal control group (average mean diameter: normal group: 8.2 mm cervical myelopathy: 6.2 mm).
