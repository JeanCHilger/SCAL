Spinal stenosis at the level of atlas in a boy with Down syndrome. A case report and literature review. The appearance of congenital anomalies at the level of atlas is frequent in patients with neural alterations, as well as in the Down syndrome. The presence of clinical stenosis for alteration in the posterior arch of C1 without a previous atlantoaxial subluxation hasn't been described in the literature thus far.We report an exceptional case of myelopathy due to compression at the level of the atlas in a 5-year-old boy with Down syndrome provoked by a developmental anomaly of the posterior arch of C1. A posterior laminectomy was achieved at that level with improvement of the previous symptoms.We have to pay special attention in children with syndromes associated with chondrogenesis alterations, as in the case of those with Down syndrome, to benefit from early treatment, since in most of the time they are diagnosed when symptoms are very severe.
