The validation of the diagnosis "joint dysfunction" in the synovial joints of the cervical spine. One hundred patients suffering from cervical spine involvement were examined using procedures developed by the author over a period of many years. The cases were analyzed on the basis of incidence of sex and age, duration of symptoms, role of injury, analysis of radiographic examination and assessment of manipulative treatment. Of the 100 patients, 83 underwent manipulative therapy. Thirty percent of those treated reported cessation of symptoms, and another 34% felt they had markedly improved. It is felt that such information helps to validate the presence of joint dysfunction as a manipulable condition.
