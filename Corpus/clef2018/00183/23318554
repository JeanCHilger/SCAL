Application of transanal irrigation for patients with spinal cord injury in South Korea: a 6-month follow-up study. A 6-month follow-up study.To investigate the outcome of transanal irrigation (TAI) in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and to identify factors significantly related to clinical success.Survey for community-dwelling patients with SCI in South Korea.Between December 2010 and March 2012, TAI was initiated with 52 patients (41 men age: 44.5Â±11.0 years) with neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD). At 1, 3 and 6 months after initiation, a telephone interview was conducted. Data were collected on patient-specific bowel management and TAI performance as a new procedure.Only 18 patients (34%) used TAI for at least 6 months, which was a lower compliance rate than similar studies in some European countries. Relative to the compliant group, the noncompliant group contained a higher proportion of tetraplegia than paraplegia (P=0.031), and a higher proportion dependent on physical help (P=0.034). In all, 33 of the 52 patients (63.5%) complained of practical problems with the TAI procedure such as expulsion of the rectal catheter. Fifteen patients (28.8%) presented with adverse effects. The incidence of practical problems or adverse effects did not alter the frequency of patient-reported successful outcome.Korean participants showed a relatively lower compliance rate with TAI. We conclude that TAI, combined with adequate patient instruction and physical assistance, has potential as a management tool for NBD in Korea.
