Pedicle fixation without bone fusion for the treatement of thoracolumbar fractures through paraspinal approach. To evaluate clinical effects of pedicle fixation without bone fusion in treating thoracolumbar fractures through paraspinal approach.From January 2006 to January 2009, 25 patients (15 males and 10 females) with thoracolumbar fractures were treated. The average age was 39.3 years,ranged from 17 to 49 years. According to classification, flexion fracture in 7 cases, brust fracture in 18 cases. There were no nervous injury, and radiology information showed the angle of sagittal vertebral body >20 degrees or collapse of vertebral body >40%,without vertebral injury. The operation were performed at 3 to 7 days after injury (mean 5 day). Internal fixation implants were removed at 8 to 12 months after operation. The height, kyphosis angle were measured before operation, 1 week and 24 months after operation,and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were compared before and after operation.All patients were followed up for 24 months. Among them, 1 case was followed up at 30 months after operation. The operation time ranged from 70 to 110 (mean 90) minutes, the blood loss was 120 to 280 (mean 200) ml. The height of vertebral body and kyphosis angle were obviously corrected, and had significant differences between postoperation immediately and at the final follow-up (P<0.05). There were no differences after remove of internal fixation (P>0.05). The final ODI was (5.36 +/- 1.21)%, had statistical differences compared with preoperation (P<0.05).For flexion and burst thoracolumbar fractures without nervous injury, pedicle fixation without bone fusion is a good method,which has advantages of minimally invasive, rapid recovery, and maintain spinal motion segment.
