Staged bilateral far-lateral approach for bilateral cervicomedullary junction neurenteric cysts in a 10-year-old girl. Neurenteric cysts are rare and benign lesions that consist of ectopic alimentary tissue residing in the central nervous system. They tend to occur most frequently in an intraspinal rather than intracranial location. Intracranial neurenteric cysts are a rare occurrence in the pediatric population. These lesions typically present as unilateral cystic structures in the lower cerebellopontine angle and craniocervical junction. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no reported cases of bilateral localization of intracranial neurenteric cysts. In this report, they present an unusual case of a 10-year-old girl who was found to have bilateral intracranial neurenteric cysts at the pontomedullary junction. The patient was successfully treated with staged, bilateral far-lateral transcondylar resection of the cysts. The authors also provide a brief overview of the literature describing intracranial neurenteric cysts in children.
