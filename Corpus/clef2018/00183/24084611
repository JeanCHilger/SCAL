Spinal cord avulsion in the pediatric population: case study and review. Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) is a rare phenomenon, but with advances in imaging and improvements in magnetic resonance imaging more cases are being identified. Even more uncommon is the finding of spinal cord avulsion as a type of SCIWORA with only single case reports in the literature. We present the case reports of 2 patients both experiencing spinal cord avulsion as a type of SCIWORA, secondary to improper lap-belt restraint during a motor vehicle accident.
