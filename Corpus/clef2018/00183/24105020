Is posterior fixation alone effective to prevent the late kyphosis after T-L fracture? The posterior transpedicular fixation technique is a standard procedure for stabilizing the injured thoracolumbar spine but the long-term results of this approach are controversial. Clear guidelines are missing and the literature shows complete disagreement regarding indications, approaches, surgical techniques, and type of fixation.The objective of this study is to investigate if the surgical treatment by posterior approach alone is always enough to prevent the late kyphotic deformity through the retrospective analysis of 219 patients affected with a thoracolumbar injury. Follow-up examinations included radiographic measurements of the sagittal index (SI) and the sagittal plane kyphosis (SPK).Results show that, at the follow-up, the SI remains almost stable after the surgical correction, while the SPK (which describes the eventual injury of the affected intervertebral disc) decreases indicating a progressive regional kyphotic deformity. Thus, in some cases posterior fixation alone is not sufficient for long-term spinal stabilization and often can be not effective to prevent the late kyphotic deformity.
