Pharyngeal perforation after blunt cervical trauma in child. Pharyngeal perforation caused by non-penetrating cervical trauma is an extremely rare clinical entity both in adults and children. Data concerning management of this type of injury are quite rare in surgical and even scarcer in pediatric literature. Since delay in treatment may be associated with life-threatening complications, prompt diagnosis coupled with appropriate therapy is essential for achieving favorable clinical outcome. To the best of authors' knowledge, the present study illustrates for the first time the experience with successful treatment of pharyngeal perforation caused by a blunt cervical trauma in a child.
