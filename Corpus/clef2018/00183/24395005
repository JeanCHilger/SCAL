Cervical spine alignment in the pediatric population: a radiographic normative study of 150 asymptomatic patients. To describe the normal cervical sagittal alignment of the pediatric spine in a normal population and to identify the changes during growth period.We randomly selected in PACS database 150 full-spine standing views. Exclusion criteria were: age >18 years, spinal deformity and any disease affecting the spine (medical charts reviewing). For cervical alignment we measured: OC-angle according to Mc Gregor, C1C7 angle, upper cervical angle, inferior cervical angle and C7 tilt. Spino pelvic parameters were analyzed: T1 tilt, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic incidence, sacral slope and pelvic tilt. We compared two age subgroups (juvenile and adolescent). Differences between age groups and gender were tested using Student's t test. Correlations between sagittal spinal parameters were evaluated using Pearson's test.Cervical spine shape was correlated to cranio cervical orientation to maintain horizontal gaze (r = 0.60) and to thoracic kyphosis (r = -0.46). Cervical spine alignment was significantly different between the two age groups except for the global C1C7 cervical lordosis, which remained stable. A significant gender difference was found for all the cervical sagittal angles (p < 0.01) whereas no differences were demonstrated for the spino pelvic parameters, except the lumbar lordosis (p = 0.047).This study is the first to report the cervical spinal alignment in a normal pediatric Caucasian population. Even though cervical lordosis is the common shape, our results showed variability in cervical sagittal alignment. Cervical spine is a junctional area that adjusts its alignment to the head position and to the underlying spinal alignment.
