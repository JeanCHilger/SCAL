Detection of early esophageal cancer and cervical lymph node metastases by (18)F-FDG PET/CT in a patient with Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, pancytopenia, and cancer susceptibility, especially to leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or esophagus. F-FDG PET/CT is a useful tool to assess tumor staging and follow-up of esophageal cancer. We report a rare case of cervical esophageal cancer and lymph node metastases detected on F-FDG PET/CT in a patient with Fanconi anemia after bone marrow transplantation.
