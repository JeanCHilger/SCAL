Changes in head posture and nasopharyngeal airway following surgical correction of mandibular prognathism. It was the aim of the present study to cast light on the role of the mandible in relation to head posture and airway space by evaluating patients before and after surgical correction of mandibular prognathism. The material comprised standardized profile cephalograms of 52 patients with mandibular prognathism. All patients had received orthodontic adjustments prior to mandibular osteotomy. Mean age of the patients was 24.3 years, and 12 males and 40 females participated in the study. The first profile radiograph of each patient was obtained the day before surgery in the natural head (mirror) position. All patients underwent mandibular surgery with a bilateral vertical ramus osteotomy. Approximately one year after surgery, the cephalometric investigation was repeated. Head posture was evaluated by the craniocervical angulation (NSL/CVT and NSL/OPT) and airway space as nasopharyngeal airway size (ad1 and ad2). Changes in posture and airway (ex.2-ex.1) were evaluated by paired t-tests. The results showed a mean increase in head posture of 2.7 degrees (p less than 0.001) and a mean reduction in airway space of 2.3 mm (p less than 0.001).
