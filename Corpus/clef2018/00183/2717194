Lower limb fractures in the chronic spinal cord injured patient. Experience in managing 33 lower limb fractures in 25 chronic spinal injured patients is described. An increased awareness among patients and medical staff is required to avoid misdiagnosis. Effort should be made to ensure bone union in satisfactory position, recognising the different requirements of ambulant and non-ambulant patients. 'Soft pillow splints' were found to give the best results in all fractures other than those of the femoral neck. Operative treatment with antibiotic prophylaxis is only indicated to correct important deformity.
