Clinical significance of congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae: a report of 87 cases. Based on clinical analysis of 87 cases with congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae, the clinical significance of these lesions was discussed in detail. It was found that the C 2-3 and then the C 3-4 were the sites of frequent involvement. Fusion of 2 to 3 segments was common and showed no clinical signs of abnormality, nor associated with any other malformations. While fusion of multiple segments, though rare, was often associated with other anomalies such as short neck, lowered posterior hair line, webbed neck and malformation of internal organs and other bones. Single lesion does not give rise to symptoms until late when degenerative changes have taken place in the unfused vertebrae in most cases, or following trauma in occasional patients, usually of neurologic upsets. However, fusion at several especially levels, fusion of C 2-3 with occipitalization of atlas predisposes the nerve to damage. In short, remedy is only necessary for cases with symptoms: conservative treatment for those with symptoms caused by radiculopathy, and operation for those with symptoms of myelopathy.
