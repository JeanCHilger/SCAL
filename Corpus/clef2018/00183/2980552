Low dose cervical CT myelography. How acceptable are adverse effects at this juncture? When cervical myelography is required, the highest incidence of adverse effects usually supervenes. These effects are particularly important in patients with metastatic disease, post-cervical trauma and out-patients. Low dose hydrosoluble CT myelography imaging (300-500 mg I, total dose) can be accomplished by injecting the contrast medium when the patient is in the CT scanner via C1-2 puncture with a small needle (e.g. 25 gauge). Our method of accomplishing this was to use C-arm fluoroscopy performed with the patient either supine or prone and to transfer the patient with the needle in situ to the scanner. This was done with the patient on a portable exchangeable CT table top. Remarkably few adverse effects (transient mild headache in 2 of 22 patients) would appear to render this technique safe and useful.
