Spontaneous resolution of spinal canal deformity after burst-dispersion fracture. We reviewed the records of 28 patients with 30 burst-dispersion spinal fractures treated since the introduction of CT facilities in Western Australia. Twenty-five patients showed spinal canal deformity and stenosis with bone fragments protruding into the canal on the initial scan. Of these, 22 patients were treated nonsurgically. Fifteen of the conservatively treated patients were available for follow-up, and they form the basis of this report. Thirteen of the 15 patients who had repeat CT at follow-up showed correction of the previously measured spinal canal stenosis by spontaneous resorption of intraspinal bone fragments. In view of this previously unreported finding, it is suggested that the role of surgical correction of spinal canal stenosis resulting from displaced bone fragments after trauma be more clearly defined.
