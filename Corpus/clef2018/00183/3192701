Identification of acute posttraumatic spinal cord cyst by magnetic resonance imaging: a case report and review of the literature. Posttraumatic spinal cord cysts have traditionally been diagnosed late. The condition is usually considered after the neurological sequelae of spinal cord trauma have not resolved. The diagnosis has usually required invasive radiographic techniques, or even surgical exploration. Magnetic resonance imaging is a new, non-invasive diagnostic technique that appears to be more accurate than previous procedures. Moreover, it has the ability to delineate spinal cord parenchymal lesions much earlier than other methods. We present a case report and literature review of posttraumatic spinal cord cyst.
