Evaluation of the efficacy of using regional cooling of the spinal cord in complicated spinal injury. In 48 patients with complications after the spinal column trauma the local spinal cord cooling has been performed postoperatively. The positive results were: increased pulse blood flow to the spinal cord, reduction of the alpha-motor units excitability, and pain relief. Simplicity and safety of the local cooling allow it to be performed routinely in the spinal care units.
