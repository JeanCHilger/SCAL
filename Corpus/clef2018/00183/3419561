Anterior cervical fusion with the Caspar instrumentation system. Twenty-eight patients with a variety of cervical spine abnormalities underwent anterior cervical spine stabilization with the Caspar osteosynthetic plate/intervertebral body bone graft technique. The available hardware and operative technique are presented, and case reports illustrate clinical applications. Complications and results of the series are presented. A brief discussion of applicable biomechanical principles and of technical pitfalls leading to potential fusion failures and a review of experience and developments in cervical plating techniques are included.
