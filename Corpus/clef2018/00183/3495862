Retrospective study of the possible role of injuries in the genesis of ankylosing spondylitis, Fiessinger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome and other reactive arthritis, unclassified B27 rheumatism in adults and chronic B27 arthritis in children. If the revealing or aggravating effect of traumas is known in the course of ankylosing spondylarthritis, their etiological role is debatable. We have reviewed 370 files of patients with ankylosing spondylarthritis, 11 of which were mentioning a post-traumatic onset, without being able to find a single case which could satisfy irrefutably the criteria of imputability. It was the same for 51 cases of the Fiessinger Leroy Reiter syndrome 29 cases of reactional arthritis and 42 cases of unclassifiable Rheumatism HLA B27+, and all affections that could develop into an ankylozing spondylarthritis. On the contrary, in 53 cases of chronic juvenile arthritis HLA B27+, we found 5 cases which satisfied the criteria attributable to a trauma. The critical review of the literature also leads us to question the causal role of trauma in cases of ankylosing spondylarthritis and the Fiessinger Leroy Reiter syndrome where trauma is presented as such.
