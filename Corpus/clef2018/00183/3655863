Comparison of spinal magnetic resonance imaging and myelography in cancer patients. Spinal involvement by systemic malignancy is common, and often leads to extradural compression of the spinal cord and/or nerve roots by metastases. Rapid, anatomically accurate diagnosis is essential to the successful management of these patients. We compared spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional myelography in a series of 31 cancer patients being evaluated for myelopathy (N = 10), or back/radicular pain (N = 21). All patients were evaluated between April 1985 and July 1986, and underwent both studies within ten days of each other (median, two days). MRI was performed on a 0.5 Tesla Technicare unit with a body surface coil, and results compared with standard contrast myelography. All studies were reviewed separately and in a "blinded" fashion. MRI and myelography were comparable in detecting large lesions that produced complete subarachnoid block (five of ten patients with myelopathy, three of twenty-one patients with back/radicular pain). In 19 of 31 patients, smaller but clinically significant extradural lesions were found. In nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated equally well by both modalities in nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated by myelography alone
