Laryngotracheal trauma: a protocol approach to a rare injury. Laryngotracheal trauma is rare and complications are frequent. Twelve major series totalling 392 cases have been published over the past decade, with complication rates as high as 40%. We have treated over 30,000 trauma victims at our Level I Trauma Center over the past 5 years, of which 109 had neck injuries, but only 12 suffered cervical laryngotracheal trauma. The mechanism of injury was penetrating in eight and blunt trauma in four. The time to tracheostomy decannulation varied from 7 to 60 days. Airway patency was assured without stenosis or significant granulation tissue in 10 of the 12 patients. Three patients suffered permanent voice changes. Based on review of the 392 previously reported cases and a critical analysis of our 12 cases, a detailed management algorithm is proposed.
