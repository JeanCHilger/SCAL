Magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging has unique capabilities for evaluating musculoskeletal trauma. It can clearly delineate tears and hemorrhage in muscles, ligaments, and tendons and can provide clinically useful information in patients with joint injuries. Other developing applications include evaluation of compartment syndromes, injuries of peripheral nerves and blood vessels, and chronic sequelae of trauma. If a correct technical approach is employed, MRI has a clinical role that is complementary to other imaging modalities.
