The evaluation of minor cervical blunt trauma in the pediatric patient. Blunt trauma delivered directly to the neck of the pediatric patient may be associated with significant airway compromise. The external signs are not indicative of the extent or site of the trauma. A high index of suspicion is warranted in all patients with this type of injury. A patient with apparently minor direct trauma to the neck is presented to illustrate the principles of evaluation and treatment of these injuries.
