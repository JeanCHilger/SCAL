Traumatic infarction of the spinal cord in children. Infarction of the spinal cord in childhood is rarely due to trauma. During a 15-year period (1971 to 1985), eight children were admitted to The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, with a diagnosis of traumatic infarction of the spinal cord. All of these patients had delayed onset of neurological signs varying between 2 hours and 4 days after their initial trauma. No bone abnormalities were seen on plain spine x-ray films. Myelography was carried out in seven of these children and found to be normal in all seven. Six patients who were paraplegic at the time of admission remained permanently paraplegic, but two with incomplete cord signs did show some improvement.
