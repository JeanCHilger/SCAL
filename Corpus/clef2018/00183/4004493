Spinal intradural arachnoid cyst. The authors report the case of a 13 year-old boy who presented after minor cranial trauma with severe gastrointestinal symptoms (acute hemorrhage) followed by neurologic signs evoking a spinal compression. Gastro-intestinal hemorrhage was related to a duodenal lesion induced by acetylsalicylic acid. Neurologic symptoms were related to an intra dural cervical arachnoid cyst. After surgical resection of this congenital malformation outcome was favorable.
