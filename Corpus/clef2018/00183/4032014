Evaluation of acute nonpenetrating cervical spinal cord injuries with CT metrizamide myelography. Computerized tomography metrizamide myelography was performed in 46 patients with acute, nonpenetrating cervical spinal cord injuries. By visualizing the spinal canal, spinal cord, and any compressive lesion, the study proved valuable in the decision as to whether surgical decompression was indicated and what approach should be used. Eleven patients were found to have significant spinal cord compression, 10 of whom were treated surgically. The technique, results, and complications resulting from the study are discussed.
