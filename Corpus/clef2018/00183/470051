Roentgenographic evaluation of cervical spine trauma. A practical approach to the roentgenographic assessment of a patient suspected of having a cervical spine injury is described. Once positioned, the patient is not moved until substantial bony injury has been excluded. The major roentgenographic signs with differential diagnosis are briefly discussed using some illustrative roentgenograms.
