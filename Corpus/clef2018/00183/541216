Birth injury to the spinal cord. 11 cases of children with birth injury to the spinal cord born between 1960 and 1970 are presented in review and compared to about 200 previously published cases. 8 children presented at delivery with one or both feet and 2 with breech. 9 of these infants were born by difficult extraction and needed resuscitation due to primary asphyxia. One child had an easy vertex delivery without evident risk. Diagnosis was established within the first days of life, based on flaccid motor and sensory paralysis below a defined level, mostly in the cervical or upper thoracic spine, with bladder and bowel paralysis, and confirmed by autopsy or by follow-up study. One child with disruption of the spinal cord above C4 survived only a few hours despite artificial ventilation. 4 children died within the first three years of life, 3 of them due to acute pneumonia. 5 of 6 surviving children were followed regularly and are now 10 to 18 years old. They are ambulant with crutches and are well integrated in their families. 4 children attend normal school, and one girl gets special training for mentally retarded children.
