Primary bone tumors of the spine in children. Apropos of 66 cases. Primary tumours of the spine in children are infrequent. The authors have studied 60 benign and 6 malignant tumours in 4 orthopaedic centres. These tumours have been diagnosed in 3 different ways - in the study of cord compression, as a finding in the course of a previously known disease, or as an isolated tumour. In most cases, the diagnosis could be made even before biopsy whose technique and indications are discussed. The treatment is based on the pathology but in all cases, it must avoid any loss of stability of the spine such as may occur after extensive resection.
