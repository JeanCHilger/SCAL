A rare cause of spinal cord compression in childhood from intraspinal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. A report of two cases and review of the literature. Two children presented with acute spinal cord compression by primary and metastatic intraspinal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, a rare pediatric malignancy. Patients with the primary intraspinal tumor usually present early and often respond well to combined surgery, irradiation and chemotherapy. Patients with intraspinal metastases present late in the course of their disease and their prognoses are poor.
