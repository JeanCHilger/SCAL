Computed tomography of traumatic atlantooccipital dislocation. Although atlantooccipital dislocation is a well-recognized radiological entity, its computed tomographic (CT) recognition has not been previously described. It is the purpose of this report to show the complementary role of CT in precisely defining the abnormalities in both the coronal and the sagittal reconstruction planes. A case is presented and the literature is reviewed.
