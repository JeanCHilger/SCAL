Computed tomography of the nasopharynx and neck. Computed tomography (CT) is unparalleled for evaluation of the nasopharynx and the neck in comparison with other radiologic modalities. Its ability to demonstrate soft tissue and bone abnormalities has established its role as a primary method of radiologic diagnosis, frequently obviating the need for further radiologic elaboration. Furthermore, in many cases, CT provides distinction among inflammatory, neoplastic, and traumatic conditions.
