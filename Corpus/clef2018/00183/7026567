Congenital elevation of the scapula. Surgical correction by the Woodward procedure. We reviewed the cases of eleven patients with congenital elevation of the scapula who were treated by the Woodward procedure. A discussion of the characteristic findings, associated congenital anomalies, indications for operation, and surgical techniques, and a review of the literature, also are presented. The average postoperative increase in combined shoulder abduction in the eleven patients was 29 degrees. However, if preoperative abduction was less than 120 degrees (five patients), the average increase in motion was 50 degrees. The average scapular lowering was 1.6 centimeters. The cosmetic results were rated as excellent or good in 82 per cent of the patients. It is significant, however, that in more than 60 per cent of the patients unsightly surgical scars developed. The importance of the often-underemphasized rotational component of Sprengel's deformity is stressed, as well as the importance of the meticulous surgical technique and attention to detail that are essential for the best results.
