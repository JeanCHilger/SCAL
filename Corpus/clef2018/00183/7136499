Cerebrospinal fluid protein findings in cervical syndromes classified by myelography, and in multiple sclerosis. Determinations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albumin, IgG, albumin blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and local IgG synthesis indexes in CNS were carried out on 85 patients with various neck, shoulder and upper extremity pain syndromes. CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture in 29, and by lateral neck puncture in 56 of the patients. The patients were classified into 3 different groups according to varying severity of degenerative changes, or cavitation verified by myelography. CSF protein patterns in these patients were compared with lumbar CSF findings in 18 patients with multiple sclerosis. CSF protein changes in patients with abnormal myelographic findings were slight. Protein values were clearly more abnormal in lumbar CSF than in cervical CSF, probably due to a retardation of the CSF flow. Only 3 of 62 patients with a narrowing of the cervical spinal canal had pathological values for IgG synthesis or BBB permeability indexes. On the other hand 14 of 18 patients with multiple sclerosis had abnormal, high values for the IgG index. Thus the present results suggest that investigation of the CSF protein pattern has value in differential diagnosis between patients with multiple sclerosis and degenerative diseases of the cervical spine.
