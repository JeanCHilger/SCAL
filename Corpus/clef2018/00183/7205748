Cartilaginous tumors of the spine : a report on three cases with neurological symptoms (author's transl). Three cases of cartilaginous tumors of the spine are reported. The first patient had a benign lumbar vertebral enchondroma which had recurred locally on several occasions, causing severe functional sequelae. The second case concerned a patient with a chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull, in whom radiological signs were observed only secondarily on a standard film. The third patient had exostosing disease with an intra-canal osteochondroma provoking neurological disorders. The relative value of computed tomography and opaque myelography is discussed in relation to the last case.
