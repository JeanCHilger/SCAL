Cystometry and UPP measurement under fluoroscopic visualization by means of X-ray television in patients with a traumatic spinal cord lesion. At the beginning of urination training in 38 patients with traumatic spinal cord lesion, who were in an early recovery stadium, the UPP measurement under an evacuated bladder state, cystometry and the UPP measurement repeated again with a full bladder were investigated. These investigations indicated the possibility of how to achieve the urination training, the indication for proper medication, antiadrenergic or other spasmolytic drugs and the determination of the proper site, bladder neck or external urethral sphincter, for transurethral operation, if necessary. Moreover, the results of these measurements were divided into 3 groups, according to the change of the UPP curve and the state of the cervical portion of the bladder (shut or open), with bladder filling (cystometry).
