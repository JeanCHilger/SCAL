Gastrointestinal complications of spinal cord injury. The incidence, nature, and radiographic features of gastrointestinal complications encountered in a group of 567 consecutive spinal-cord-injury patients are reported. Eighty-seven episodes of gastrointestinal complications developed in 63 (11%) patients. During the first month postinjury, these complications consisted of ileus, gastric dilatation, the body cast syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, and pancreatitis. More chronically these patients presented with fecal impactions, peptic ulcer disease, the superior mesenteric artery syndrome, hepatitis, amyloidosis, and the precocious appearance of diverticulosis, hiatus hernia, and gastroesophageal reflux. Radiographic findings were diagnostic in the majority of cases and aided in the early diagnosis of these potentially life-threatening complications.
