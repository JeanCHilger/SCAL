Orthopedic management of the patient with a spinal injury. I have tried to make clear that there are no absolute principles in the orthopedic management of patients with a spinal cord injury. Although debate continues regarding the approach to the problem, the goals remain optimal patient care, free of complications, and preparation for a smooth transition of the patient into a new life with handicaps. Most strides in spinal cord injury care have been made in improvement of internal fixation and immobilization, advances in rehabilitation techniques and marked shortening of hospitalization. Active research continues to investigate the pathophysiology of the injury and a means of reversing or impeding the damage to neural tissue. Currently, certain spinal cord injuries are considered irreversible despite treatment with spinal cord hypothermia, reanastomosis of spinal cords or administration of enzyme injections. The person with a spinal cord injury and paralysis rarely loses the hope that a cure might be the next great discovery of medical science and active spinal cord injury research centers have the same goal.
