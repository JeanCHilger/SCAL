The electrophysiological study of differential diagnosis between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Sternocleidomastoid muscle EMG (SCM-EMG) and dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential (DSSEP) were evaluated as diagnostic aids in differentiation between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) in this study. 104 inpatients were divided into three groups: those diagnosed clinically as either (A) ALS (36 cases), or (B) CSM (32 cases) and (C) those needed further investigation (36 cases). EMG of limb muscles and sternocleidomastoid of both sides in all, and of tongue muscles in 58/104 of three groups DSSEP in 56/104 of all three groups
