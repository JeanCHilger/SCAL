Injuries of the spine and spinal cord as isolated and multiple injuries. A series of 511 patients after vertebral column and spinal trauma admitted to Department of Neurosurgery of University of Medical Sciences, Pozna≈Ñ from 1979 to 1992 has been analyzed. Isolated vertebral and spinal injuries in 49 per cent. In 51 per cent they were associated with multiple injuries. Traffic accidents constituted the main cause (50 per cent of multiple injuries). The severity of the injury was assessed on the base of AIS, ISS rating systems and spinal symptoms. The concomitant multiple injuries were no cause of delay to surgical intervention within vertebral column. The short-term results of the treatment were better in isolated spinal injuries, with 5 per cent mortality rate in both groups.
