Comparison of three different methods of axial rotation assessment in idiopathic scoliosis. In a group of 20 children with idiopathic scoliosis the degree of axial rotation was measured with the use of radiography (Drerup's method), ultrasonography and computer tomography. The measurements obtained by Drerup's radiographic method and by ultrasonography were compared with the results of the CT measurements, the latter being considered as the most precise. According to the statistical analysis of the results the spinal axial rotation measurements according to the Drerup's radiographic method appeared to be more precise than the ultrasonographic method. An equation was presented permitting to calculate the tomographic rotation angle RAsag on the basis of the results of the Drerup's radiographic measurement.
