This diagnosis is often missed due to concurrent asphyxia. Ultrasound studies clearly showed the localisation and the extent of the injury. These findings were later confirmed by MRI.Ultrasonography is recommended as the initial imaging technique to evaluate possible spinal cord lesions in the neonate.
