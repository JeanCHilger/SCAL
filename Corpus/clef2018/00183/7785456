Ethnic differences in bone density in female South African nurses. In the United States, the higher prevalence of osteoporosis and the higher incidence of fractures in whites than in blacks may be attributed to the finding of lower bone density (BD) in both white children and adults. In South Africa, osteoporosis and fractures also occur more frequently in whites than in blacks. Appendicular BD has been found to be similar in black and white children in South Africa, but there is little information available on BD of adults in South Africa. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess changes in BD with age in adult females in South Africa and to assess possible differences in peak BD and in the rate of postmenopausal bone loss between blacks and whites. Data for 180 black and 184 white female nurses aged 20-64 years were analyzed. The distal radius bone density (RBD) was measured by single photon absorptiometry. The lumbar spine bone density (SBD) and the femur bone density (FBD) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Blacks were shorter than whites (p = 0.0001), and blacks' weight, body mass index, and skinfold thickness increased with age. Peak SBD and RBD were similar in blacks and whites, but peak FBD was higher in blacks (p = 0.0001). This ethnic difference in peak FBD became apparent in the fourth decade. Peak FBD was similar in black and white subjects with normal body mass indices (p = 0.09), but in overweight subjects peak FBD was higher in blacks than in whites (p = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
