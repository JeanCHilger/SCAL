Fractures of the odontoid process: analysis of the functional results after surgery. Eighteen patients who sustained type II/III fractures of the odontoid process, as classified by Anderson and D'Alonzo [2], underwent anterior screw fixation, as described in detail by BÃ¶hler [4] as well as Grob and Magerl [16]. Follow-up investigations 3, 12 and in some cases up to 60 months later confirmed sufficient functional results regarding the mobility of the upper cervical spine. The passive mobility of the cervical spine was analyzed by the radiographic evaluation technique of Dvorak and co-workers [12] and Penning [26], which revealed a hypomobility of the C2-3 segment 1 year after surgery in 11 patients and a fusion of the C2-3 vertebral bodies in 2 cases. The postoperative results including the rate of complications were compared with other authors's findings and different therapy concepts (e.g., posterior C1-2 arthrodesis, halo-vest treatment).
