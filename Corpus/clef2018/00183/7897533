Nonsurgical approach to paraparesis due to extramedullary hematopoiesis. Report of two cases. Two cases of spinal cord compression due to extradural extramedullary hematopoiesis are reported and the nonsurgical means used for their diagnosis and treatment are presented. One patient was treated with blood transfusions and radiation therapy, the other with blood transfusions alone. Both patients have made almost complete clinical recoveries from spinal cord compression. A mechanism is proposed to explain how blood transfusions can serve as an important diagnostic, as well as a therapeutic, tool in the management of this entity.
