Delayed worsening of the surgical correction of angular and axial deformity consequent to burst fractures of the thoracolumbar or lumbar spine. Forty-one patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction, or the lumbar spine (T12 to L5), were followed for 6-48 months (mean follow-up = 19.9 months) after early surgery (usually within 24 hours). Preoperative, early postoperative, and late postoperative degrees of kyphosis, as well as percent reduction of the height of the vertebral body were calculated and compared. Early postoperative radiologic evaluations showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001) between the mean values of both parameters calculated respectively before and after surgery. The decrease of the surgical correction, from the initial postoperative radiographs to follow-up, was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). However, the final values were better when compared with the preoperative features (p < 0.003 and p < 0.0001, respectively for degree of kyphosis and reduction in vertebral height.
