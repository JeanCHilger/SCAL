Sternum fracture--description of this injury based on 100 patient follow-up studies and review of the literature. One hundred patients with sternal fractures were investigated in order to demonstrate the incidence of complicating cardial, pulmonary and spinal injuries. Isolated sternal fracture was found in 73/100 patients. In the majority of cases (68/100) traffic accidents were causative in 10% an accompanying injury of the spine was found. No patient presented electrocardiographic or clinical signs of myocardial contusion, so that no specific therapy or further investigations by myocardial scintigraphy, two-dimensional echocardiography or biventricular radionuclide angiocardiography was necessary. In our group of patients with isolated sternal fractures, no pathologic results were found on ECG examination or anteroposterior chest radiograph
