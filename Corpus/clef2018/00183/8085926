Reliability of percutaneous intramuscular electrodes for upper extremity functional neuromuscular stimulation in adolescents with C5 tetraplegia. Chronically indwelling percutaneous intramuscular electrodes were implanted in the upper extremity muscles of five adolescents with C5 or C5-6 tetraplegia in an effort to provide lateral and palmar prehension using the neuroprosthetic system designed by Case Western Reserve University. The responses from 177 electrodes were evaluated at 3-month intervals and included measurements of electrical impedance and an assessment of recruitment properties. Electrode failures were categorized as breakage, an altered stimulated response or adverse sensation during stimulation. Survival probabilities were generated for all electrodes, each muscle group, the volar and dorsal exit sites, intrinsic and extrinsic muscles, and according to the subjects' time postinjury. The overall probability of an electrode surviving to 6 months was 0.75 and the 1 year survival probability was 0.56. Among muscle groups, the finger extensor and thumb adductor electrodes had the highest proportion of failures and the poorest survival likelihoods within the first year after implant. According to the Breslow test, significantly smaller survival chances were predicted for electrodes exiting dorsally and for the newly-injured adolescents (< 1 year postinjury). The cumulative survival likelihoods of this study are smaller than those reported in adult applications using the same electrode design. Factors that may account for the disparate results are discussed.
