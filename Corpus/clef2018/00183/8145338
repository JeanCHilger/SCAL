Occipital condyle fracture must be considered in the pediatric population: case report. To our knowledge, no case of occipital condyle fracture after minor head trauma in the pediatric population has been published. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with a Jefferson's fracture detected on x-ray films. Axial high resolution computed tomography and coronal reconstruction images demonstrated the additional occipital condyle fracture.
