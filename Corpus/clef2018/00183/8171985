Treatment of unstable fractures, dislocations and fracture-dislocations of the cervical spine with Senegas plate fixation. The results of the anterior approach to the cervical spine for the treatment of fractures and dislocations by arthrodesis and Senegas plate fixation are described. Twenty-two patients underwent a one- or two-level arthrodesis of the cervical spine. Their mean age was 42 years. The injuries were subdivided using the radiological classification described by Harris. In the group of patients who presented with a complete neurological deficit below the level of injury, there was only one patient who deteriorated. X ray examination 1 year after surgery showed fusion in 17 patients (100%). In contrast to some recent cadaveric and animal studies in which the anterior approach and fixation were found to be less stable than posterior fusion, our results obtained with this method are excellent, despite the fact that post-operative immobilization was limited. Problems with the anterior approach did not arise in these 22 patients. Alignment was always acceptable and fusion was achieved within one year in all cases.
