Traumatic atlanto-axial dislocation in children: 7 cases. Seven cases of atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation in children are reported. The CT scan permitted differentiation of the lesions in all the cases. Analysis of the results has led us to introduce two modifications for Fielding's classification: a distance between the atlas and odontoid of less than 5 mm is normal. sagittal dislocation must be included in the same classification. We propose the following therapeutic protocol: rotatory luxation without tears of the transverse ligament should receive orthopedic treatment, rotatory luxation with tears of the transverse ligament should have surgical treatment if orthopaedic treatment fails. sagittal luxation with or without rotatory fixation needs surgical treatment.
