Mucopolysaccharidosis: thickening of dura mater at the craniocervical junction and other CT/MRI findings. Cranial CT and/or MRI imaging of 8 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) was retrospectively evaluated. Two patients had MPS IH, 1 had MPS IS, 1 had MPS IVA and 4 had MPS IV. CT and MRI showed thickening of dura mater at the cranio-cervical junction, causing narrowing of the subarachnoid space, in all the patients examined. Spinal cord compression was detected in 4 patients. Other findings were: white matter alterations, mild to severe hydrocephalus, skull dysplasia and odontoid dysplasia. White matter alterations were evident as large areas and as multiple dispersed spots of prolonged T1 and T2 value. Reduced gray/white matter contrast was demonstrated on T2-weighted MRI images. It is important to examine the cranio-cervical junction carefully for thickening of dura mater in all patients with mucopolysaccharidosis examined by CT or MRI, because of the generally progressive clinical course of MPS. In patients with symptomatic cord compression, surgical intervention should be considered.
