Ligamentotaxis with an internal spinal fixator for thoracolumbar fractures. We assessed narrowing of the spinal canal in 39 burst fractures and fracture-dislocations of thoracolumbar vertebrae treated by the AO Internal Spinal Fixator, using CT preoperatively and at various stages postoperatively. Computer-aided planimetry was used to measure the narrowing, and its restoration shortly after instrumentation, or at 15 months. The mean initial reduction of canal area was to 63.7% +/- 18.8% of normal this was restored to a mean of 95.4% +/- 21.2% of normal when measured either soon after surgery or at 15 months (p < 0.001 for both groups). There was more improvement in cases assessed later. For fractures from D12 to L3, the mean canal area was restored to 99.4% of normal
