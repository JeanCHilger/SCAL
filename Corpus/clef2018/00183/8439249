Motor and sensory recovery following complete tetraplegia. Sixty-one individuals admitted for rehabilitation with a diagnosis of complete tetraplegia due to traumatic spinal cord injury underwent prospective examinations for motor and sensory recovery. The amount of motor, light touch and sharp/dull (pin prick) sensory recovery was independent of the initial neurologic level of injury between C4 and C8. In the interval between one month and one year following injury, the American Spinal Injury Association Motor Score increased an average of 8.6 +/- 4.7. However, the rate of motor recovery rapidly declined in the first six months and then approached plateau. Ninety-seven percent of muscles with Grade 1/5 ("Trace") or 2/5 ("Poor") strength one month after injury recovered to > or = 3/5 ("Fair") strength by the time of first annual follow-up. Muscles with 0/5 strength one month after injury and located one neurological level below the most caudal level having motor function regained > or = 3/5 strength in only 27 percent of cases at one year follow-up and at two levels below in only 1% of cases.
