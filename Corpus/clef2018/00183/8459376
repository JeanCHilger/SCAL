The adequacy of cervical spine radiographs in the accident and emergency department. One hundred and twenty radiographs of the cervical spine were performed at the request of the Accident and Emergency (A & E) department over a 6 week period. These consecutive films were reviewed for adequacy of anatomical demonstration of the complete cervical spine. The initial series of three films presented to the A& E staff achieved this objective in only 55% of cases overall, although further radiographic examinations requested before the patient left the department raised this figure to 75% for the lateral view and to 70% for the combined anteroposterior (AP) views. From the data it can be predicted that if every patient whose first 3 films were inadequate had received further investigation, the cervical spine would have been well visualized on approximately 90% of radiographs in each plane. The availability of radiologists for advice and their involvement with senior A & E staff in teaching are important factors in improving this situation.
