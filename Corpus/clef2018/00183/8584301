Restoration of gait by functional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injured patients. In this clinical study, we report the results of functional electrical stimulation for the ambulation of paraplegic patients without long leg braces (LLB), according to the Parastep approach. Of 13 SCI patients with complete neurological lesions included in this trial, 12 progressed to independent ambulation with the aid of the Parastep. The average walking distance was 76 m, with a maximum of 350 m, and the mean speed 0.2 m s-1. Compared to the situation with long leg braces, which in fact are given up by most paraplegic patients, long term home use seems to be much more important. Tolerance of this method is satisfactory. The psychological benefits of the device are remarkable. From this experience, it is concluded that this method is valuable for the restoration of standing and walking in the long term management of spinal cord injury patients.
