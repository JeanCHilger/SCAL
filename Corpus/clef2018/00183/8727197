Complications and long-term outcome of upper cervical spine arthrodesis in patients with Down syndrome. A retrospective review of 15 patients with Down syndrome who had undergone arthrodesis of the upper cervical spine for instability.To determine the complication rate and long-term outcome after posterior cervical arthrodesis for upper cervical instability in patients with Down syndrome.Atlantoaxial instability is common in patients with Down syndrome, and fusion of the upper cervical spine has been recommended for patients who have instability, with or without myelopathy. Unfortunately, the results of posterior cervical arthrodesis are not well reported, and the natural history of this condition is unknown.Fifteen patients with an average follow-up period of 74.6 months (range, 24-142 months) were reviewed after posterior arthrodesis of the upper cervical spine. Twelve patients were reexamined by the investigators specifically for the purpose of this study, and three patients had long-term follow-up results available from chart review.Eleven of 15 patients (73%) sustained 23 major complications including nonunion, loss of reduction, neurologic deterioration, late subaxial instability, infection, and wound dehiscence. Six patients (40%) required seven reoperations to address a complication. Ultimately, 12 patients (80%) obtained osseous union, but a definite clinical improvement was identifiable in only three patients, whereas two others had worsened neurologically at latest follow-up evaluation.A high complication rate should be anticipated after posterior arthrodesis of the upper cervical spine in patients with Down syndrome. A cautious approach to asymptomatic instability in this condition is advocated.
