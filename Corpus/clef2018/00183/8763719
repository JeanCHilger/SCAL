Vertebral compression revealing acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Vertebral compression is rarely the first manifestation of acute leukemia (AL) in children.Three children, 13, 4 and 13 years of age respectively, suffered from recent and persistent back pain. The first patient was considered as having psychosomatic problems despite thrombocytopenia at the first examination. The second patient was also pale with hematoma on his legs so that AL could be rapidly recognised. An initial diagnosis of Scheuermann disease was proposed for the third patient in whom hemogram was performed due to worsening of his general condition. The three patients had extended vertebral demineralisation on the first X-rays.Causes of back pain in children are often organic at this age of life. They must be searched by suitable examinations.
