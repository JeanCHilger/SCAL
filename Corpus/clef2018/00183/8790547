Cervical meningomyelocele associated with spina bifida in a hydrocephalic miniature colt. Cervical meningomyelocele, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus were diagnosed in a newborn miniature colt that was unable to stand and had a cystic mass in the caudal portion of the dorsal cervical region. Results of physical examination and ultrasonographic imaging of the brain supported the diagnosis of hydrocephalus. Results of radiographic evaluation of the vertebral column were consistent with spina bifida at C5-C6. Fluid aspirated from the cervical mass resembled CSF. Radiography of the cervical region after injection of iohexol into the mass revealed herniation of the spinal cord through a large bony defect, supporting the diagnosis of spina bifida and meningomyelocele. Meningomyelocele, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus are interrelated congenital anomalies in other species. Meningomyelocele should be suspected in foals that have neurologic abnormalities, especially if they have other congenital anomalies and a fluid-filled mass along the dorsal midline.
