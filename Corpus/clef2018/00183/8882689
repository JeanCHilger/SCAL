Cervical interbody xenograft with plate fixation: evaluation of fusion after 7 years of use in post-traumatic discoligamentous instability. This retrospective study analyzed clinical and radiologic follow-up evaluations of cervical arthrodesis where interbody xenograft combined with internal fixation was used for management of post-traumatic discoligamentous instability.To report results of use of xenograft to avoid the various disadvantages linked to the use of autologous or allogenous bone graft.Ligamentous instability of the cervical spine is unlikely to heal in a high proportion of cases, and surgical arthrodesis is usually indicated. Anterior arthrodesis has proved to be a safe procedure, but many problems are associated with the use of autograft or allograft. Given the great number of xenograft procedures, there are relatively few reports in the literature.A retrospective study analyzed a consecutive series of 52 patients presenting with post-traumatic discoligamentous instability of the cervical spine in which cervical interbody xenografts with plate fixations were done. Follow-up clinical evaluation for neck pain and radiologic evaluation for arthrodesis stability and xenograft fusion at various points in time were done.The long-term results in 41 patients were satisfactory: no infectious complications, extrusion, fracture, loss of height, or resorption of the graft. Seventy-five percent fusion was seen before 9 months after surgery, and 100% fusion was seen 3-18 months after surgery (average, 7.4 months).Interbody xenograft combined with a rigid plate fixation avoids the problems linked to autologous or allogenous bone graft and gives a safe and solid interbody fusion when arthrodesis is required in ligamentous instability of the cervical spine.
