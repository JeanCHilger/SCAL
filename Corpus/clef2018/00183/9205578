The triple wire technique for bifacet dislocation of the cervical spine. A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the triple wire technique in 34 patients who had sustained bifacet cervical spinal dislocations. Skull traction was applied on admission in all patients and the dislocation as gradually reduced under sedation. The operation was undertaken as soon as the general condition of the patient permitted. A triple wire construct utilizing an iliac graft was used in all cases. The patients were mobilized with a soft collar following operation. All grafted areas united and there were no malunions. No patient deteriorated neurologically.
