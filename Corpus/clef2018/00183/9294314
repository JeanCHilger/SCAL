A case of idiopathic spinal epidural hematoma with a fructuation of the symptoms. We reported a 9-year-old girl with idiopathic spinal epidural hematoma. She complained of her back and neck pain only during night for a few days, followed by days with no symptoms (a few days remission of her symptoms). This episode repeated, and she was suspected to have a psychogenic reaction. However, 28 days later after the first symptoms appeared, paralysis of lower extremities, anesthesia and urinary bladder dysfunction (neurogenic bladder) appeared. Spinal MRI showed a spinal epidural hematoma at the C 5-Th 2 level. An emergency operation of laminectomy and evacuation of the hematoma was done, and she has recovered gradually. We diagnosed her as having idiopathic spinal epidural hematoma. Excerbations of symptoms during nights were thought to be due to an elevation of venous pressure by lying, and transient remissions were due to intermittent small hemorrhages.
