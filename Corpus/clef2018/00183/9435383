Spinal cord injuries in children. Spinal cord injuries are rare in children, in face of their higher mobility comparing to adults. The high cervical and the thoracic segments of the spine are more frequently affected. In the last 10 years we had 90 cases of spinal injuries in our service being 12 with neurologic deficient (8 male and 4 female) and four of them without radiographic abnormality, even in the dynamics studies. The authors emphasise the possibility of occurrence of neurologic deficit in children after trauma, even without any radiographic abnormality.
