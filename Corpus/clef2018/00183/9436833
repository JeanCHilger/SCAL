Anomaly of arch of atlas--a rare cause of symptomatic canal stenosis in children. Symptomatic canal stenosis at the level of atlas (C1) without atlantoaxial dislocation is thought to be very rare in children. Though common, anomalies of the arch of atlas are generally incidental findings in X-rays. High cord compression due to a narrow canal from a bifid posterior arch, or an absent posterior arch, is a very rare condition. We report 5 children with high cord compression from stenosis of C1 arch.
