Disorders of micturition in neurological patients. A clinical study of 786 patients. Our aim was to evaluate the utility and effectiveness of a study protocol for neurological involvement in neurological disorders. We studied a sample of 786 patients with neurological disorders followed by the Neurological Department of Catania University and applied to them a four-step diagnostic protocol. Fifty-six per cent of the sample showed urological functional abnormalities only 78 patients (9.9%) presented with an organic urological disease. Among the vesicosphincteric dysfunctions, bladder hyperreflexia was the most common pattern with remarkable differences between diseases. The present study demonstrated the utility of a standardized urological protocol in the screening and detection of neurological involvement in neurological diseases. Our protocol showed good specificity and reasonable low costs.
