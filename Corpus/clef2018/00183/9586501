Increase of the vertical occlusal dimension by means of a removable orthodontic appliance and its effect on craniocervical relationships and position of the cervical spine in children. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the increase in the occlusal vertical dimension by means of an orthodontic appliance on craniocervical relationships and position of the cervical spine. Thirty children presenting malocclusion were divided into two groups of 15 (a study and a control group). Those in the study group wore an orthodontic appliance to correct cross-bite. The children in the control group had no treatment during the experimental period. Two lateral craniocervical radiographs were taken for each child. The first one was taken in the intercuspal position in both groups. The second radiograph was taken of the study group after four months of wearing the appliance and also of the control group after four months. Cephalometric analysis in the study group showed a significant forward cervical spine position. There were no significant changes in the control group. The changes found in the study group suggest that when there are signs and symptoms of cervical dysfunction in children undergoing long-term orthodontic treatment, it is necessary to make an evaluation of the cervical column position after the insertion of any orthodontic appliance which increases the occlusal vertical dimension.
