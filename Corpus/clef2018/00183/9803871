Whiplash injury syndrome. A prospective study of 39 patients with whiplash injury. The acute symptoms after whiplash trauma can be explained by the neck sprain, but the pathogenesis of the "late whiplash syndrome" and the reasons why only some people have persistent symptoms more than six months are still unknown. Thirty-four consecutive cases of piskesmaeld injury were examined clinically three times respectively within 14 days, after one month and finally seven months post-injury. In addition, MRI of the brain and the cervical spine, neuropsychological tests and motor evoked potentials (MEP) were done one month post-injury and repeated after six months, if abnormalities were found. We found the total recovery rate (asymptomatic patients) was 29% after seven months. All MEP examinations were normal. The correlation between MRI and the clinical findings was poor. Cognitive dysfunction as a symptom of brain injury was not found. Stress at the same time as the accident predicted more symptoms at follow-up. We conclude that long-lasting distress and poor outcome were more related to the occurrence of stressful life events than to clinical and paraclinical findings.
