Osseous primitive neuroectodermal tumor--a case report. PNET and Ewing sarcoma are pathologically distinct entities with very similar clinical and radiological characteristics. Immunohistochemical studies are needed to distinguish PNET from Ewing sarcoma, with the former being characterized by neural differentiation. We present the case of a 17-year-old man with immunohistochemically confirmed PNET in the cervical vertebrae.
