Primary epidural non-Hodgkin lymphoma: spinal cord compression syndrome as the initial form of presentation in childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Primary epidural non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a rare but devastating event in pediatric oncology. Spinal cord compression due to an epidural mass from NHL, although it presents as a localized problem, in fact, is a systemic disease. Over the last 3 decades, aggressive systemic treatments with central nervous system prophylaxis have been designed with improving results.We reviewed the 20-year experience of the treatment of NHL with the LSA2-L2 protocol in our institution. Among 256 patients treated, five presented with primary epidural mass. Clinical features, treatment, and outcome of those five patients are presented.Three patients out of five responded favorably, and after a median follow-up of 10 years, they are cured. After presenting with paraplegia, functional and neurological recoveries were excellent. Of the patients who failed treatment, relapse occurred early, either during the treatment or right after completion of therapy. The relapses were within the central nervous system as well as systemic.Patients with primary epidural NHL presented with long histories of persistent back pain. Plain films of the spine were useless. All patients were diagnosed when neurologic damage had already been established. However, when the epidural NHL is treated aggressively with systemic chemotherapy and vigorous rehabilitation, the prognosis for complete neurological recovery and cure of the lymphoma is encouraging.
