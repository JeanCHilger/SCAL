Neuroimaging of scoliosis in childhood. A curvature abnormality may be the initial or major presenting feature in a child with disease of the spinal column or spinal neuraxis. A simplified classification of common spinal curvature abnormalities of childhood include idiopathic, congenital/dysraphic, skeletal dysplasia, neurofibromatosis, and painful. The great majority of childhood scoliosis falls into the idiopathic category. Atypical clinical or radiographic features in a presumed idiopathic scoliosis may indicate an otherwise occult tumor or hydrosyringomyelia, or may be a consequence of increasing curvature with disk protrusion, nerve impingement, or cord attenuation. Neuroimaging beyond plain films is commonly necessary for atypical idiopathic scoliosis and for the other categories of scoliosis listed.
