A study of shoulder motions as a control source for adolescents with C4 level SCI. This study quantitatively examined and compared the shoulder motions of C4 level spinal cord injury (SCI), C5 level SCI, and able-bodied persons as a command source. The study was motivated by both the success of shoulder control in functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems designed for C5 level SCI people and the lack of quantitative information on the shoulder motion of persons with C4 level SCI. A dual-axis transducer was used to monitor the elevation/depression and protraction/retraction angles of each subject's shoulder while they performed three experimental sections which examined: the range of active shoulder motion the ability to move incrementally to discrete positions with the aid of visual feedback
