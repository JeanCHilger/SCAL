Cartoid artery calcification in a general dental population: a retrospective study of panoramic radiographs. To determine the prevalence of carotid artery calcification and the degree of cervical spine imaging for three different brands of panoramic radiograph machines in a retrospective study, all panoramic radiographs exposed between January and June 1994 were reviewed for frequency of cervical spine imaging and radiopacities of the soft tissue in the region of the common carotid artery bifurcation. While carotid artery calcifications are not common in a general dental population, they can be found in up to 5 percent of older patients. Our data support panoramic radiography as a device that may identify patients at risk for developing a cerebrovascular accident, although we do not recommend making this radiograph for calcification detection alone.
