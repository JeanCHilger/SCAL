Worker turnover because of spinal pathologies in the wards and outpatient clinics of the hospitals of Leno and Manerbo, Brescia. A total of 306 employees of the hospitals of the Leno/Manerbio health area underwent clinical and anamnestic examination in order to ascertain the existence of degenerative diseases of the spine associated with "manual handling of loads" risk. The prevalences obtained for positive anamnestic threshold concerning the lumbosacral spine, the trend of total acute low back pain and of low back pain in the last year showed lower values compared to the entire national group and in any case lower or only slightly above the values for the reference group of non-exposed subjects. Therefore, in order to assess the real prevalences of disorders due to incorrect load handling in hospital environments, it is important to assess the presence of associated disorders of the spine also and especially in outpatients departments. In fact, unsuitable or unfit staff had recently been transferred from the wards to outpatients departments. 56 workers from outpatients departments underwent physical-anamnestic examination: 16 workers (4.5% of the entire group under study) from average-to-high risk wards were identified as suffering from degenerative disorders of the lumbosacral spine. Therefore the prevalence of unfit subjects from hospital wards, cancelling the effect of the turnover factor on outpatients departments, led to an almost twofold total frequency, which rose from 6.9% to 11.4%.
