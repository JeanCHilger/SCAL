Significance of surgical treatment of bursting fracture with CT estimation analysis of the anatomy of pedicle of vertebral arch. Using CT analysis of 3-D anatomical data of the pedicle of the vertebral arch as a guideline, we standardized the pedicle screw insertion technique. Fourty-six bursting fracture cases were treated using a AF 3-D pedicle screw system with the standard technique and followed up for over 12 months. Comparision was made with the former non-standard technique performed in 72 cases. The results showed that each screw reached the maximum depth with an accurate angle. Comparision of the former non-standard technique showed a significant difference between the two groups. 46 bursting fracture cases obtained anatomical reduction in 3-D and rigid fixation after follow-up for 12 months. Pedicle screw, inserted through the pedicle anatomical axis can reach the maximum depth, that will achieve best stability and ideal clinical result. CT analysis supplies reliable individual data for standardization of pedicle screw insertion.
