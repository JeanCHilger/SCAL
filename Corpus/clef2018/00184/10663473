Dermal sinus with dermoid cyst in the upper cervical spine: case note. We describe a 5 year-old girl who had a skin dimple of the back of her upper neck. MRI showed a dermal sinus tract in the upper cervical spine, associated with an intramedullary dermoid cyst at C 2-3, and spina bifida. A laminectomy was performed, the dermoid cyst and the sinus tract were completely removed. This congenital complex is very rare.
