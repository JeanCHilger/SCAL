Spinal cord compression: a rareness in pregnant thalassemic woman. Thalassemia is a common hematological disease in Southeast Asia. Extramedullary hematopoiesis is common sequelae in thalassemic patients but extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spinal epidural space that leads to paraparesis in pregnancy is very rare. We managed a thalassemic patient with extramedullary hematopoiesis and spinal cord compression during pregnancy. The diagnosis was made on clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing a paravertebral mass infiltrating the epidural space. She was treated successfully with repeated blood transfusions until delivery. Fetal growth restriction was found but otherwise the fetus was clinically normal. She had an uneventful recovery when she was seen 6 weeks after delivery.
