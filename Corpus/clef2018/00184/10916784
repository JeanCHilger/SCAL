Symptomatic Langerhans-cell-histiocytosis of the cervical spine in a child: case report. We report on a six year old female presented with a painful torticollis and a hemidysaesthesia caused by destruction of the third cervical vertebra and a paravertebral soft-tissue mass. At diagnostic routine finally a biopsy gives the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. In a second open approach the destructed vertebral body was replaced by a precisely adjusted autologous bone interponate and the patient was maintained in halo vest immobilisation. The outcome is described and an overview of the current literature is given.
