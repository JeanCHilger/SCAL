Influence of facet joint angles and asymmetric disk collapse on degenerative olisthesis of the cervical spine. This study examined the facet angles of the joint facets of the intervertebral joints, the anterior and posterior heights of the intervertebral disks, and cervical lordosis as possible parameters of olisthesis. Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine in 123 patients were examined, and parameters were correlated to anterolisthesis and retrolisthesis in each segment. Results indicate anterolisthesis is caused by a decrease of the facet angles of the caudal joint facets. This process is favored by loss of anterior height of the intervertebral disks and a flattened position of the cervical spine. Loss of posterior height of the intervertebral disks promotes retrolisthesis.
