Cervical myelocystoceles and meningoceles: long-term follow-up. Little is known about the long-term prognosis of patients with cervical myelocystoceles and meningoceles. In this study, we report the long-term follow-up (average 10 years and 8 months) of 8 patients with cervical myelocystoceles and meningoceles. Neurologic, orthopedic, urologic and psychosocial status was assessed on long-term follow-up. The results indicate that in patients with cervical myelocystoceles, neurologic deficits become noticeable in the first year of life as the infant matures. Motor deficit was common in these patients, whereas sensory and urologic deficits did not occur. We believe that this is related to underlying myelodysplasia. In addition, patients with cervical myelocystoceles tend to have significant orthopedic problems. In contrast, patients with cervical meningoceles do not have neurologic deficits, but do develop mild orthopedic problems.
