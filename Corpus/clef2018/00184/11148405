Spinal epidural angiolipomas: a rare cause of spinal cord compression. A report of 8 cases and review of the literature. Extradural spinal angiolipomas are rare benign tumors containing vascular and mature adipose elements. We report 8 cases of spinal epidural angiolipomas in 6 females and 2 males. In 7 cases, the clinical manifestation was a progressive spinal cord compression and one case had a regressive paraparesis mimicking a multiple sclerosis. In the 8 cases, the localization was thoracic with an extradural complete type of contrast block in 2 cases and partial in 5 cases. The myelo-CT achieved in 7 cases and the magnetic resonance imaging done at our last case revealed a fat-containing epidural tumor. The tumors were removed in all cases through a laminectomy with a successful outcome after an average of 9 years (range: 6 months-12 years). Sixty-seven similar cases in the international literature are reviewed. A total of 75 cases have been studied: 45 women and 30 men with a mean age of 46.3 years (range: 6-73), presenting a progressive spinal cord compression in 68 cases and in 7 cases a regressive paraparesis mimicking a multiple sclerosis. Myelography shows an extradural compression of the thecal sac. MRI is nowadays the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of these lesions. The surgical removal often easy of the epidural spinal angiolipomas permit a fast recovery. The etiopathogenesis of this process is still controversial between the dysembryogenetic and malformative hypothesis.
