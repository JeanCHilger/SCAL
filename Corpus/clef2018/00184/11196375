Surgical risk factors in Larsen's syndrome. The authors report on a child with typical Larsen's syndrome with some rare findings such as mixed-type hearing loss and with some potentially fatal operative risks including laryngomalacia and cervical instability. A few deaths with Larsen's syndrome have been reported associated with various fatal risks such as spinal instability. Therefore, laryngomalacia and several other potentially fatal risks are presented in this report as awareness may prove essential to orthopedic surgeons.
