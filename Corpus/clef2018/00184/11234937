An analysis of burst fractures of the spine in adolescents. Burst fractures are less common in children than in adults because of the greater mobility and elasticity of the pediatric spine. Because of these spine characteristics, these fractures may behave differently in childhood than in adulthood. To try to address these differences, we reviewed our experience with 11 children (5 boys, 6 girls) treated for burst fractures. Average age at time of injury was 14.4 years. Follow-up averaged 9 years. All fractures were categorized using the Denis classification system for burst fractures. Three children had associated spinal cord injury. Five children were treated with nonoperative bedrest and casting the other 6 children, who had the most severe burst fractures, were treated with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation. Satisfactory functional results were found in 90% of the children at follow-up. Radiological evaluation at initial and follow-up examination showed that children treated operatively improved or maintained their fracture kyphosis (range, 12 degrees - 19 degrees). Anterior vertebral compression improved an average of 15% (range, 24%-39%). In the children treated nonoperatively, kyphosis progressed an average of 9 degrees (range, 15 degrees - 24 degrees), and anterior vertebral compression increased a further 8% (range, 36%-44%). Our results showed that (a) the children who sustained burst fractures tended to develop mild progressive angular deformity at the site of the fracture, (b) operative stabilization prevented further kyphotic deformity as well as decreased the length of hospitalization without contributing to further cord compromise, and (c) nonoperative treatment of burst fracture was a viable option in neurologically intact children, but progressive angular deformity occurred during the first year after the fracture.
