Videoscopic retropleural and retroperitoneal approach to the thoracolumbar junction of the spine. A minimally invasive anterior approach has been developed for the thoracolumbar junction of the spine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibilities of videoscopic treatment of fractures and malunions of the thoracolumbar junction and to report the first results obtained with this technique.Video-assisted surgery was performed in eleven patients using costal resection and a retropleural and retroperitoneal approach. Anterior arthrodesis was performed in all cases, four with anterior instrumentation. The indications were trauma for six patients and malunion for five.Mean follow-up was 17.4 months. For malunion patients, the mean angular gain was 22.4 degrees. Radiological anterior fusion was achieved in all cases except one. The mean angular loss was 5.7 degrees.The surgeon can control the procedures by direct vision, while the assistant follows the operation on the video display screen. The upper par of L1 can be reached via a supradiaphragmatic retropleural approach, while a larger exposure is possible if the insertions of the diaphragm are released and the retroperitoneal space is opened. The crus does not have to be sectioned to expose the lateral part of the thoracolumbar vertebrae. Possible complications are similar to those which can be observed with open procedures.The videoscopic approach enables the exposure of throacolumbar junction with a smaller parietal lesion than with open procedures. It enables arthrodesis procedures with corporectomay, angular correction and anterior osteosynthesis.
