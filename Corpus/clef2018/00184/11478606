Complex vertebral malformation in a holstein calf: report of a case in the USA. Complex vertebral malformation (CVM), a familial syndrome of Holstein calves, has been reported in aborted fetuses and in prematurely born, stillborn, and neonatal calves. Affected calves have anomalies in the vertebral column, including hemivertebrae, fused and misshapen vertebrae and ribs, scoliosis, and vertebral synostosis. Concurrent low body weight, symmetrical arthrogryposis, and cardiac anomalies have been documented in affected calves. The syndrome was identified and characterized in Holstein cattle in Denmark however, a global distribution of this genetic disorder is likely based on identification of common ancestral sires widely used for artificial insemination. This is the first documented case of CVM in a Holstein calf in the USA.
