Urodynamic observations following spinal trauma. A method of the urodynamic investigation of paraplegic and quadriplegie patients is described. Serial measurements of the urethral pressure profile in patients with developing reflex micturition demonstrate a rising pressure at the external urethral sphincter with time following spinal trauma. Patterns of micturition with detrusor-sphincteric imbalance are described in patients with both early and well-established reflex micturition.
