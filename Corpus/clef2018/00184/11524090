Vertebral artery injury in cervical spine trauma. Forty-seven patients with cervical spine trauma were evaluated prospectively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) to determine the incidence of vertebral artery injury. Twelve patients (25%) had vertebral artery injuries (one bilateral), and occlusion was identified in nine patients and dissection in four. The vertebral artery injury did not result in neurological dysfunction. No specific treatment was instituted for the vascular injury, and in four patients, MRA showed no evidence of recanalization at follow-up.
