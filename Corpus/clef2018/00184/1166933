Penetrating injuries to the neck. Pitfalls in management. One hundred patients with penetrating injuries to the neck were evaluated. The safest, most expeditious method of managing a penetrating injury to the neck is still prompt surgical exploration. Patients with positive physical examination have definite indications for surgerymin our series, 93 per cent of these patients had significant injuries. Patients with negative physical examinations are still optimally treated with neck explorations. The mortality of this series was 2 per cent. In specific situations, nonoperative management of penetrating injuries to the neck may be useful. This modality, however should not be construed as "conservative" management. Specific pitfalls noted include inadequate neck exploration, failure to completely examine the patient, and being unprepared for exploration outside the neck.
