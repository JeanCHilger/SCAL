Development and use of a wrist fusion plate for children and adolescents. Arthrodesis is a widely accepted treatment for several destructive disorders of the wrist joint. Previous literature has shown that compression plating is a reliable technique for achieving rigid fixation and fusion in adults. The goal of this study was to apply similar principles of adult wrist fusion to children, using a custom-designed fusion plate sized for children. Five children underwent wrist fusion using rigid fixation and dorsal plate application. Mean age at time of surgery was 16.4 years. The indication for surgery was paralysis (spinal cord injury) in three and spasticity (cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury) in two. Surgery was performed through a dorsal approach and combined with carpectomy in the two patients with spasticity. Follow-up averaged 2.2 years and radiographs showed solid fusion and proper alignment of plate and screws. Improved stability and limb function were noted by patients and family. There were no instances of hardware failure, and plate removal has not been required.
