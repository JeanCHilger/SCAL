Evaluation of children with suspected cervical spine injury. The evaluation of a child with a suspected cervical spine injury differs substantially from that of an adult. Knowledge of the developmental anatomy and injury patterns is necessary to evaluate and manage these children effectively. Improved imaging techniques are facilitating the radiographic evaluation of such patients, and the understanding of trauma patterns and how these patterns influence the stability of the cervical spine is increasing. With the growing awareness of the pathoanatomy and natural history of these injuries, it will be possible to manage the issues related to the cervical spine in children more effectively.
