Cervical spine disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and amyloidosis. The aim of this radiographic study was to ascertain the extent of inflammatory cervical spine disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated by secondary amyloidosis (SA). The study involved 147 patients with RA and SA, whose cervical spine radiographs were available. They were treated at the Rheumatism Foundation Hospital, Heinola, during the period 1989-2000 and had had RA for a mean of 24 years. The inflammatory abnormalities of the cervical spine were studied from radiographs taken at or after the diagnosis of SA during flexion and extension. One-hundred and eleven (76%) patients had subluxations, impaction or apophyseal joint ankylosis. Atlantoaxial impaction (AAI) was seen in 76 (52%) patients and anterior atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) in 59 (40%). Apophyseal joint ankylosis was the third most frequent finding, seen in 34 (23%) cases. A combination of AAI and apophyseal joint ankylosis was noted in 26 (18%) patients. Eight (5%) patients had undergone surgery on the cervical spine. In conclusion, inflammatory and destructive changes are frequent in the cervical spine of patients with RA and SA. Characteristic changes are AAI and AAS. RA patients with SA have more severe disease than those in epidemiological studies when cervical spine disorders are concerned.
