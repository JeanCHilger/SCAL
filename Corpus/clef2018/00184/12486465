Surgical treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy associated with athetoid cerebral palsy. After a mean follow-up period of 7 years (range 4-17 years), we reviewed the cases of 14 patients who underwent surgical treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy associated with athetoid cerebral palsy. All of the patients who underwent anterior decompression and arthrodesis showed degeneration and increased range of motion of the adjacent disc despite halo-vest immobilization postoperatively. Laminoplasty is useful in cases in which physiological lordosis is present preoperatively, whereas a case with preoperative kyphotic deformity showed increased neurological symptoms and deterioration of activities of daily living postoperatively due to increased kyphotic deformity and canal stenosis. Anterior decompression and arthrodesis following posterior fusion with lateral mass plating and posterior wiring is a favorable option for patients with highly kyphotic deformity and canal stenosis, as it preserves neurological status and cervical alignment postoperatively.
