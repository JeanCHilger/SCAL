Multiple-level thoracolumbar burst fractures in teenaged patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of multiple-level burst fractures in teenaged patients. Five teenaged patients were identified with this injury pattern. The mean age at injury was 17.6 years. All five patients underwent a posterior fusion and an attempted decompression through ligamentotaxis. One of the five went on to have an anterior decompression. Four of the five patients had spinal instrumentation. Neurologic deficit was present in four patients. The proximal fracture was most often responsible for the neurologic deficit when present. The average length of follow-up was 4.5 years. There was no significant neurologic recovery after hospital discharge. Three of the five patients had minimal or no back pain at latest follow-up. The authors conclude that multiple burst fractures should be treated individually based on their clinical and radiographic characteristics.
