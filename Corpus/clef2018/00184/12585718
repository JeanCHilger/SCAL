Value of neuroimaging in the evaluation of neurologically normal children with recurrent headache. Headache is one of the most frequent physical complaints in children. Although headaches in children are generally benign, neuroimaging studies are frequently performed in clinical practice for the fear of missing a serious underlying disease. Despite this, limited data exist about the utility of neuroimaging in recurrent headache of children with a normal neurologic examination. This prospective study was planned to determine the value of neuroimaging in neurologically normal children with migraine and tension-type headache. Among 95 consecutive patients presenting with headache, 72 patients receiving a diagnosis of migraine or tension-type headache were included in the study. Neuroimaging procedures were performed in 83%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was abnormal in 11 of 49 cases. Abnormalities consisted of foci of gliosis in four, sinusitis in two, pineal cyst in one, periventricular leukomalacia in one, arachnoid cyst in one, old traumatic changes in one, and cervical syrinx in one. Two of the 11 computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed sinus disease. The percentage of findings causally related to headache was about 10. None of the patients had undergone surgery because of neuroimaging results. In conclusion, the yield of neuroimaging in recurrent headaches of children with a normal neurologic examination is low, and neuroimaging should not be part of a routine initial examination of these patients.
