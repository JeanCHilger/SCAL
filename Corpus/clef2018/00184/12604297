Extramedullary haemopoiesis in thalassemia intermedia presenting as paraplegia. Extramedullary haemopoiesis causing spinal cord compression is a rare manifestation of thalassemia. We describe a 17 year old male with thalassemia intermedia who presented with progressive paraplegia and sphincter disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an epidural lesion extending from T5 to T8 compressing the spinal cord. The patient recovered completely after surgical decompression with postoperative radiation therapy. Histological examination of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of extramedullary haemopoiesis. Clinical awareness of this phenomenon with early treatment is essential for optimizing the neurological outcome.
