Occipitocervical reconstruction with the Ohio Medical Instruments Loop: results of a multicenter evaluation in 30 cases. Stabilization of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) remains a significant challenge. In this multicenter study, the authors present the results of an evaluation of a precontoured titanium implant, the Ohio Medical Instruments (OMI) Loop, for craniocervical fixation.In this multicenter retrospective study the authors evaluated 30 patients (16 female, 14 male mean age 53.8 years) with rheumatoid arthritis (15 cases), traumatic occipitoatlantoaxial instability (six cases), congenital vertebral anomalies (two cases), instability due to basilar invagination in the setting of Chiari malformation (two cases), or Down syndrome (one case), tumor (one case), os odontoideum (two cases), and pseudarthrosis/other (one case), who underwent OMI Loop-assisted occipitocervical reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 25.4 months (range 6-60 months). A solid reconstruction was achieved in 29 of 30 casesThe authors found that the OMI Loop is a versatile precontoured occipitocervical fixation device that can be applied to a wide range of CCJ lesions. It provides excellent immediate rigid fixation of the CCJ, a high rate of osseous fusion, and a low rate of hardware failure.
