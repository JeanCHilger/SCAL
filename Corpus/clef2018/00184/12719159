Blunt cervical spine injuries in Scotland 1995-2000. In the Accident and Emergency Department, the management of patients who have sustained head injuries (HI) is often made more complicated by the suspicion of a cervical spine injury (CSI). This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of CSI in patients sustaining blunt head injuries in a Scottish population.Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for a 5-year period from the Scottish Trauma Audit Group (STAG) database. Logistic regression and other comparisons were used to investigate the relationship between Glasgow coma score/scale (GCS) and the incidence of CSI.A total of 5154 patients met the criteria for the study and 273 of the HI patients had associated CSI giving an overall incidence of 5.3%. Patients presenting with GCS of 3 were almost three times more likely to have a CSI compared to patients with an initial GCS of 4 or more (12.5% versus 4.4%, chi(2)=62.9, d.f.=1, P<0.001). When patients with GCS of 3 were excluded, there was no evidence of an increase in the incidence of CSI with a lower GCS (logistic regression chi(2)=0.09, d.f.=1, P=0.75).The risk of CSI in patients with blunt head trauma and an admission GCS of > or =4 does not decrease as GCS increases. Patients with blunt head injuries who present with a GCS of 3 are much more likely to have a concomitant CSI. The overall incidence of 5.3% compares with published series from other countries.
