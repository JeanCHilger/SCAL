Chiropractic care of a pediatric patient with myasthenia gravis. To describe the chiropractic care of a pediatric patient with complaints associated with myasthenia gravis. Clinical features A 2-year-old girl was provided chiropractic care at the request and consent of her parents for complaints of ptosis and generalized muscle weakness (ie, lethargy), particularly in the lower extremities. Prior to entry into chiropractic management, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and acetylcholine receptor antibody tests were performed with negative results. However, the Tensilon test was positive and the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was made by a pediatrician and seconded by a medical neurologist. Intervention and outcome The patient was cared for with contact-specific, high-velocity, low-amplitude adjustments to sites of vertebral subluxation complexes in the upper cervical and sacral spine. The patient's response to care was positive and after 5 months of regular chiropractic treatment her symptoms abated completely.There are indications that patients suffering from disorders "beyond low back pain" as presented in this case report may derive benefits from chiropractic intervention/management.
