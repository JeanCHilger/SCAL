Traumatic lesions of lower cervical spine. In the years 1965-1990 in the hospital department for treatment of spinal injuries 1330 patients with spinal lesions at the C5-Th1 levels were treated after admission early after trauma. The most frequent causes of injuries of this part of the spine were falls from horsecarts, jumping into water head first and traffic accidents. The relationship was analysed between the degree of spinal cord injury and the mechanism of spine injury, and also the results were compared of conservative and surgical treatment. The most severe damage to the spinal cord was observed after traumas involving the flexion mechanism. Typical crush fractures of vertebral bodies had be best prognosis. Significant neurological improvement was obtained in over 50% of the treated patients, and it was more pronounced and occurred more frequently after surgical treatment.
