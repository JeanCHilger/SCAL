Klippel-Feil syndrome. Nurses working with orthopaedic clients and pediatric populations may be the first to recognize the classic triad of Klippel-Feil syndrome: short neck, limitation of neck motion, and low occipital hairline. Klippel-Feil syndrome is a congenital malformation of the cervical vertebrae, with limited treatment options. Client/family education is vital to monitor and maintain function and to prevent neurologic deficits resulting from the fusions, accidents, or trauma.
