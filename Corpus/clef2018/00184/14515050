Treatment of the upper cervical spine injuries with halo vest device. In the article are described cases, when patients sustained fractures of the first and the second cervical spine vertebrae and were treated with "Halo-vest" device. We performed this investigation in order to establish efficiency of "Halo-vest" immobilization and to establish regression of neurological evaluation, patients feelings and their come back to their usual environment, when 1-2 years passed after fracture and treatment. Investigation was performed in 1999-2001. We performed retrospective analysis of 58 cases. From this group we divided 25 cases. There were patients who sustained fractures of the first and the second cervical spine vertebrae and were treated with "Halo-vest" device. Twenty-two patients were treated with "Halo-vest" immobilization successfully. Three patients were operated, because close fractures repositions failed. We analyzed these patients 1-2 years after fracture and treatment, and after data analysis we made conclusion, that 69% patients after these injuries came back to their usual environment. CONCLUSIONS. Reposition of fractures in the upper cervical spine can be achieved with "Halo-vest" device. If close fractures repositions failed, then spondylodesis must be performed and alignment during operation can be maintained with "Halo-vest" device. After these injuries and treatment with "Halo-vest" device about 69% patients came back to their usual environment.
