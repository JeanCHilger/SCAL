The fixateur interne for stabilising fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. Between 1986 and 1988, 27 patients with fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine were treated by fixateur interne (FI) instrumentation, and 24 were followed up for a mean of 25 months. Complications occurred in 13 cases, mostly due to loosening and corrosion. The results were compared with plate fixation. The radiological parameters and differences between the preoperative and postoperative indices were well within the normal range. The inferiority of FI instrumentation compared to plate fixation during follow up was mainly attributable to the complications. Reduction of the posterior wall fragments by the intact posterior longitudinal ligament was not consistent, so instrumented reduction is usually the method of choice.
