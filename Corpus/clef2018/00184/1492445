Deformation in conservative treatment of vertebral fractures. The indication for functional or operative treatment of fractures of a vertebral body depend on the additional injury, on the stability of the fracture and on the amount of deformity. In a retrospective radiological study on 74 patients we analysed the behavior of secondary deformation in stabile fractures of thoraco-lumbal vertebral bodies under treatment with a 3-Points-Corset. The average initial sagittal deformity was 12.5 degrees. After three months an average increase of 1.5 degrees was measured resulting in an average increase of total kyphosis of 2.5 degrees during fracture consolidation. No further secondary changes were seen after a period of three months following the injury.
