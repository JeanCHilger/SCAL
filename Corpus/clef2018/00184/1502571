Hyperextension somersault trauma. Neurological failure can occur as one feature of hyperextension trauma of the cervical spine. Apart from predisposing factors, such as dorsal osteophytes and congenital spinal stenosis, an acute narrowing of the spinal canal caused by a hyperextension somersault trauma can cause such a trauma. We observed three cases of paraplegic syndrome resulting from hyperextension somersault trauma of the cervical spine. Fast recovery from the symptoms within 12 h indicates vascular damage. The mechanism of the accident is shown with reference to clinical and experimental investigations. Hyperextension somersault trauma is characterized by a plunge from a low height, with the danger of somersaulting of the body and impact at the forehead while the head is retroflected. For this reason, extension treatment ought to be contraindicated if an accident of this kind has happened. Emphasis should be placed on adequate positioning of the patient.
