Union of defects in the pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine in children and adolescents. The radiological outcome after conservative treatment. Lumbar spondylolysis can heal with conservative treatment, but few attempts have been made to identify factors which may affect union of the defects in the pars. We have evaluated, retrospectively, the effects of prognostic variables on bony union of pars defects in 134 young patients less than 18 years of age with 239 defects of the pars who had been treated conservatively. All patients were evaluated by CT scans when first seen and more than six months later at follow-up. The results showed that the spinal level and the stage of the defects were the predominant factors. The site of the defects in the pars, the presence or development of spondylolisthesis, the condition of the contralateral pars, the degree of lumbar lordosis and the degree of lumbar inclination all significantly affected union.
