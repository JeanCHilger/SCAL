Sacral fractures with neurological injury: is early decompression beneficial? During a 6-year period, 177 patients with a displaced sacral fracture were treated at our level-one trauma centre. At the initial presentation, 13 patients demonstrated a neurological deficit as a result of their sacral fracture. Six patients underwent surgical decompression, and seven patients were managed without surgical decompression. All patients were re-assessed at an average follow-up of 27.1 (range 12-84) months using the modified SOFCOT Index and the SF-36. Patients undergoing surgical decompression had a significantly better neurological improvement as measured by the modified SOFCOT Index (p=0.014). Moreover, patients undergoing surgical decompression had a significantly better physical function than the patients that were managed without surgical decompression, as measured by the SF-36 (p=0.044). We therefore believe that patients undergoing surgical decompression achieve better neurological improvement and better functional results.
