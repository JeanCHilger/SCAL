Should airguns be banned? In this article, we express concerns regarding the availability of airguns, the injuries that they cause and their abuse as weapons of assault. We wish to stimulate debate on this topic and report a 5-year retrospective analysis of all airgun injuries to the head and neck, presenting to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, from June 1998 to June 2003. We identified 16 patients who suffered such injuries with ages ranging from 5 to 15 years. The majority of cases were violent assaults, which is not in accordance with previous published reports. All of these occurred in public places outside the home. Most incidents occurred through the spring and summer period. Six patients required overnight stay in hospital. Nine patients required operative procedures to remove the airgun pellets. Two patients had serious eye injuries resulting in loss of vision. Two patients had penetrating neck injuries requiring exploration of the wound. The remaining group had either skin-penetrating injuries with lodgement of fragments in subcutaneous tissues or non-skin penetrating injuries. This study highlights serious injuries arising from the abuse of airguns as weapons of assault. Airguns are readily available to people without license. Recent legislation has increased the minimum age at which airguns can be carried in a public place, but we believe that stricter legislation is required to produce a reduction in the number of airgun-related injuries.
