Blind nasotracheal intubation for patients with penetrating neck trauma. Early airway management is advocated for patients with penetrating neck trauma who have any signs of airway compromise. This study examined the clinical course of patients with penetrating neck trauma who received prehospital blind nasotracheal intubation, including successful intubation rates, and outcomes.A retrospective review of patients admitted to the emergency department for penetrating neck trauma was conducted from January 1, 1993 to July 1, 2001 at the Denver Health Medical Center. Patients were identified from the trauma registry, and data were collected using standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria.The study identified 240 patients with penetrating neck trauma. Overall mortality was 8.3%. Among the 240 patients, 89 (37%) required airway management, and 40 (17%) underwent prehospital management with blind nasotracheal intubation. The success rate for prehospital intubation using the blind nasotracheal method was 90%. The mean number of attempts was 1.16 (range, 1-4), and the mortality in this group was 5%.The patients managed with blind nasotracheal intubation did not experience complications related to the choice of airway management. Despite prior warnings in the literature, the results of this study suggest that blind nasotracheal intubation may well be a valuable tool for the management of patients with penetrating neck trauma.
