Acute traumatic spinal cord injury and cardiovascular complications due to neurogenic shock: a possible threat for functional recovery. Three men aged 18, 18 and 24 years, developed hypotension and bradycardia following an acute traumatic cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury. After treatment in intensive care and 1-12 months of rehabilitation they still suffered from considerable neurological disorders. Hypotension and bradycardia are common phenomena following acute traumatic cervical and thoracic spinal cord injury. Awareness of cardiovascular complications as a possible threat for functional recovery and adequate insight in the neurological cause of hypotension and bradycardia are important issues in the acute treatment of patients with spinal cord injury. It seems sensible to admit these patients to a medium-care or intensive-care department where they can be monitored and treated by a specialised team in accordance with an adequate protocol.
