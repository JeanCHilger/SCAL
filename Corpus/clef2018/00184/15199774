Surgical strategy for wounds of the cervical part of the esophagus. An analysis of results of treatment of 425 patients aged from 15 to 85 years with penetrating wounds of the neck was made. In 40 (8.1%) patients there were wounds of the cervical part of the esophagus, 29 of them had associated injuries. The proposed active surgical strategy consisted in a necessary thorough revision of the penetrating wounds of the neck using general anesthesia and then directly in the operation room using subsidiary methods of examination such as urgent x-ray analysis with a water-soluble contrast, esophagoscopy, larengotracheoscopy. This approach allowed detection of injuries of the cervical part of the esophagus, even in cases of the absence of clinical symptoms of esophagus injuries. In all the patients the wounds of the esophagus were sutured and followed by active aspiration drainage and antibacterial treatment with modern antimicrobial medicines.
