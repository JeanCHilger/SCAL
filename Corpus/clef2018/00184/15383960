Direct fixation of the odontoid fracture in a child. The use of spinal implants in the pediatric population is controversial in terms of skeletal immaturity. The authors present the case of a 12-year-old boy with displaced Type III odontoid fracture, successfully treated by direct screw fixation. Fractures defined as Type II and Type III according to the classification by Anderson and D'Alonzo are instable spinal injuries. Type III fractures generally heal when treated conservatively. In certain circumstances, like displaced fractures or patients refusing long-term external immobilization, Type III fractures are treated surgically. A 12-year-old boy had neck injury caused by a bike accident. His main symptoms were neck pain and limitation of neck movements. Displaced Type III odontoid fracture was diagnosed. The authors treated this lesion surgically by screw fixation in order to correct displacement and to preserve the normal range of head motion. Fixation was performed by means of a single cannulated screw. Healing of the fracture was confirmed by roentgenograms done at follow-up examinations. The range of motion of the cervical spine examined 6 months after operation was normal. Direct anterior screw fixation was an effective method for treating displaced Type III odontoid fracture in a child. The rotatory motion between C-1 and C-2 was preserved.
