A new instrumentation system for the reduction and posterior stabilization of unstable thoracolumbar fractures. An innovative instrumentation and stabilization system was used for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures. The new osteosynthesis apparatus employs pedicle screw fixation, plate application, and a mechanical device for dynamic reduction in stable posterior fixation. Sixteen patients were treated with this operative technique that included a decompressive laminectomy, an arthropedunculectomy, and the removal of vertebral canal bone fragments. In most patients, three vertebral bodies, rather than four or five, were immobilized. All patients were studied pre- and postoperatively with plain radiographs and computed tomography. Pre- and postoperative examinations demonstrated no alteration in neurological status. All patients, however, with incomplete lesions showed improvement in neurological function at a mean follow-up period of 12 months. The authors' experience suggests that the new system offers ease and versatility of application, restoration of vertebral alignment through mechanical reduction, and enhanced spinal stability. The new system, moreover, enables the reduction of lateral dislocation.
