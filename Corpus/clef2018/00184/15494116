Tethered cord syndrome in childhood: diagnostic features and relationship to congenital anomalies. Tethered Cord Syndrome (TCS) is a stretch-induced functional disorder of the spinal cord that often develops and presents in childhood in association with spinal dysraphism. While the subtlety with which TCS can present makes it challenging to diagnose, awareness of the common neurological, musculoskeletal and urologic symptoms are of great value to the clinician, and can aid timely referral for neurosurgical evaluation. This article reviews these symptoms, as well as the clinical and radiological findings of the most common dysraphic conditions associated with TCS.
