Robotic-assisted, body-weight-supported treadmill training in individuals following motor incomplete spinal cord injury. Performance of therapist-assisted, body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) to enhance walking ability of people with neurological injury is an area of intense research. Its application in the clinical setting, however, is limited by the personnel and labor requirements placed on physical therapists. Recent development of motorized ("robotic") rehabilitative devices that provide assistance during stepping may improve delivery of BWSTT.This case report describes the use of a robotic device to enhance motor recovery and ambulation in 3 people following motor incomplete spinal cord injury.Changes in motor impairment, functional limitations, and locomotor disability were monitored weekly during robotic-assisted BWSTT and following transition to therapist-assisted BWSTT with the assistance of one therapist.Following this training, 2 patients recovered independent over-ground walking and another improved his gait speed and endurance.The use of robotic devices may assist physical therapists by providing task-specific practice of stepping in people following neurological injury.
