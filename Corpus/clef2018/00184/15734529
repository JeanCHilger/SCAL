Intraspinal clear-cell meningioma: case report and review of literature. Intraspinal clear-cell meningioma (CCM) is a rare morphological variant of meningioma with only 16 documented cases. We report one case and review the literature regarding intraspinal CCM.A 2-year-old boy and a 2-month-old male infant presented with knee pain and leg weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary neoplasm at T10-L1. The patient underwent radical resection of the tumor. Pathology and immunohistochemical study demonstrated a CCM. Unfortunately, the patient had a recurrence 5 years after the operation.Intraspinal CCMs are very uncommon tumors. They usually show aggressive behavior with local recurrence observed in slightly more than half of all patients. We recommend serial imaging studies every 3 to 6 months during the first several years, after which an annual imaging study should be performed for follow-up.
