Cervical meningocele with tethered cervical cord in a Chinese infant. Cervical meningocele and myelomeningocele are rare spinal dysraphic lesions. Unlike lumbosacral dysraphic lesions, there is often no neurological deficit in infants with cervical lesions, thus the subtle features of cervical cord tethering may be overlooked on imaging. We report a case of cervical meningocele in an 8-month-old girl. The tethering band, confirmed intra-operatively, was not evident on imaging. Untethering of the cord was performed together with resection of the sac and repair of the dura. Tethered cord should be suspected in the presence of cervical meningocele and intact neurology. It should be carefully looked for using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Treatment aims to prevent future neurological deterioration, and should include careful intradural exploration with untethering of the cord.
