Spontaneous bone graft resorption in os odontoideum. Two children are presented who had posterior fusion of the upper cervical spine for os odontoideum. Both patients achieved radiographic fusion but spontaneous bone graft resorption occurred, resulting in a recurrence of the original instability. An awareness of this phenomenon, which has been rarely reported, is important in the pre-operative counselling and postoperative follow-up of these patients.
