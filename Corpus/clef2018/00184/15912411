Multifocal epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in a 16-year-old boy. We report on a 16-year-old white male presenting with a 4-month history of syncopal episodes and occasional headaches. The CT and MRI studies revealed numerous lytic lesions of the skull base and cervical spine subsequently, similar lesions were demonstrated in all areas of the skeleton, and CT showed numerous lesions in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Excisional biopsy from several sites confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. We conclude that epithelioid hemangioendothelioma should be added to the differential diagnosis for lytic lesions of bone that are clustered in the same anatomic region and that might also present with visceral involvement.
