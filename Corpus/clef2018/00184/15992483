Aneurysmal bone cyst of the spine. The authors present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a painful, rapidly expanding lesion in the posterior triangle of the neck. There was no history of cervical trauma. Computerized tomography of the neck revealed a unicameral (single-chambered) aneurysmal bone cyst involving the C3 vertebra. Treatment was by open resection and curettage no recurrence was seen at six months. We discuss the natural history, differential diagnosis, radiographic appearance and treatment modalities for this unusual, benign, expanding, osteolytic lesion containing blood-filled cystic cavities.
