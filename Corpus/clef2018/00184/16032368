Polytrauma in cyclists. Incidence, etiology, and injury patterns. In our region we have noticed an increasing number of cyclists and consequently a rise in bicycle-related accidents in recent years. A large number of our polytraumatized patients are victims of bicycle-related accidents.Retrospectively we analyzed the data of our polytraumatized patients recorded between May 2003 and June 2004 for bicycle-related injuries. Of 153 polytraumatized patients treated in our emergency room 32 were cyclists (21%). The average age of our polytraumatized cyclist was 42 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.The median score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after the accident was 8 (min. 3, max. 15), the median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 24 (min. 18, max. 41), and the median Polytrauma Score (PTS) was 23 (min. 14, max. 51). A total of 30 patients (94%) suffered a head injury in 28 patients (88%) the head injury was the leading diagnosis. The median score on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) Head was 4 (min. 1, max. 5), the AIS Thorax 3 (min. 2, max. 4), and the AIS Extremities 3 (min, 2, max. 5). Our data were also compared with the official injury statistics of the region and the current literature.The most frequent and most severe injury was the head injury (94%). Of the 32 polytraumatized cyclists 30 did not wear a helmet. Successful prevention could possibly be practiced if all cyclists wear helmets.
