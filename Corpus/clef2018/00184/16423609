Skeletal dysplasia and myelopathy in congenital disorder of glycosylation type IA. We report on a boy with a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) Ia and a severe narrowing of the spinal canal caused by atlantoaxial subluxation with anterior displacement of C1. C1-laminectomy improved the progressive paresis. Progressive paresis caused by spinal cord compression is a hitherto unrecognized complication in patients with CDG-Ia.
