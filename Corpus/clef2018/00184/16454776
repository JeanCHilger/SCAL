Paediatric lap-belt injury: a 7 year experience. To highlight the injuries that result from lap-belt use and make recommendations for prevention, the recent experience of a regional paediatric trauma centre was reviewed.Retrospective review of admissions to Starship Children's Hospital from 1996 to 2003, with significant injury following involvement in a motor vehicle crash, while wearing a lap-belt. Patients were identified from two prospectively collected databases and discharge coding data.In total, 19 patients were identified over the 7 year period. The morbidity sustained includes 15 patients with hollow viscus injury, 13 laparotomies, 7 spinal fractures, 2 paraplegia and 1 fatality. A total of 11 patients required laparotomy with a median delay of 24 h. Of patients in the present series, 58% were aged less than 8 years and thus were inappropriately restrained.Lap-belt use can result in a range of life-threatening injuries or permanent disability in the paediatric population. The incidence of serious lap-belt injury does not appear to be decreasing. Morbidity and mortality could be reduced by the use of three-point restraints, age appropriate restraints and booster seats.
