Pediatric subaxial cervical spine injuries: origins, management, and outcome in 51 patients. In this study the authors evaluated the mechanisms and patterns of injury and the factors affecting management and outcome of pediatric subaxial cervical spine injuries (C3-7).Fifty-one pediatric patients (38 boys and 13 girls mean age 12.4 years, range 10 months-16 years) with subaxial cervical spine injuries were reviewed retrospectively. Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) were the most common cause of injury. Overall, 12% presented with a dislocation, 63% with a fracture, 19% with a fracture-dislocation, and 6% with a ligamentous injury. The most frequently injured level was C6-7 (33%)Subaxial cervical spine injuries are common in children 9 to 16 years of age, and occur principally between C-5 and C-7. Multilevel injury is more common in children 8 years of age and older than in younger children and infants. Most patients with subaxial cervical spine injuries can be treated conservatively. Both anterior and posterior approaches are safe and effective.
