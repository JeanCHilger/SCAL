Congenital cervical instability in a patient with camptomelic dysplasia. Camptomelic dysplasia (CD) is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia classically characterized by bent bones of the extremities, tracheobronchial narrowing, thoracic kyphoscoliosis, and various degrees of phenotypic sex reversal. Most patients die of complications in infancy, although long-term survivors have been reported.We report a case of CD complicated by incomplete ossification of the cervical vertebral pedicles, resulting in congenital cervical instability and kyphosis. Closed reduction was performed, and the patient was fitted with a customized cervical orthosis.He subsequently developed a complete spinal cord injury at the kyphotic level. This underscores the grim prognosis associated with neonatal cervical spinal instability.
