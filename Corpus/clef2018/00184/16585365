Nontraumatic upper cervical spine instability in children. The upper cervical spine begins at the base of the occiput, continues caudally to the C2-C3 disk space, and includes the occipitoatlantal and atlantoaxial joints. Nontraumatic upper cervical spine instability can result from abnormal development of osseous or ligamentous structures or from gradually increasing ligamentous laxity associated with connective tissue disorders. Such instability can lead to compression of the spinal cord during movement of the cervical spine. Establishing a correct diagnosis includes performing a thorough physical examination as well as evaluating radiographic relationships and measurements. Appropriate management of syndromes associated with instability of the upper cervical spine includes preventive care and recommendations for sports participation. Surgical treatment for the upper cervical spine includes a posterior surgical approach, used for instability, and the use of rigid plate implants, wiring, and bone graft materials to achieve a solid spinal fusion.
