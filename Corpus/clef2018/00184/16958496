Injury of the cervical spine in young children. The evaluation of injury of the cervical spine in children is complicated by biomechanics of the pediatric cervical spine that differ from those in the adult, by incomplete maturation and ossification of the vertebral segments, and by difficulties the physician may have in communicating with the child. Because the upper cervical region, from occiput to C2, is most susceptible to injury in children, it is important to have an understanding of mechanisms of injury, diagnostic imaging modalities, and therapeutic interventions. A clear understanding of adult and pediatric cervical spine differences will facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of cervical spine injuries in young children.
