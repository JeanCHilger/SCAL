Cervical meningocele causing symptoms in adulthood: case report and review of the literature. Simple meningoceles are infrequent forms of dysraphism and are often benign. These lesions are usually associated with other congenital spinal anomalies, and are typically diagnosed in childhood. Most become symptomatic in childhood because of progressive spinal cord or nerve root tethering. This article describes the case of a 47-year-old man who presented with a sac in his posterior cervical region that had been leaking colorless fluid for 3 months. He was also having difficulty walking and complained of stiffness in his lower extremities. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic mass in the region of the C4 to C5 laminae. Partial laminectomies were performed (lower portion C4 lamina, upper portion C5 lamina), the sac was totally excised, and tissue tethering the spinal cord were cut. There was no recurrence of symptoms in 12 months of follow-up. Although in cases where a cervical meningocele-myelomeningocele is detected at any time, early treatment is essential to eliminate the high risk of future neurological impairment. This is the first report of an untreated cervical meningocele manifesting symptoms in adulthood.
