Spontaneous reduction of a traumatic L2-L3 subluxation without fracture in a 14-year-old boy. To report a rare case of lumbar vertebral subluxation associated with spontaneous reduction in an adolescent treated conservatively.A 14-year-old male victim of a snowboard accident, which caused a lumbar spinal injury, was referred to the emergency room with significant lumbar pain. Neurologic examination was normal. Radiographic assessment at admission showed a unilateral left lateral subluxation of the L2-L3 vertebrae without associated fractures. These findings were confirmed by CT scan and a surgical management was decided. The preoperative MRI performed 24 h after the accident, however, revealed the spontaneous reduction of the subluxation, and an associated tear of the quadratus lumborum and the psoas muscles on the right side at the level of L2, L3 and L4. Following these findings conservative treatment with a plaster brace for 2 months was carried out. The brace was removed after 2 months. The patient had no pain and the range of motion of his lumbar spine was normal. Three months after injury, sports activities were resumed. At follow-up of 24 months, the patient was free of pain and radiographs showed a right positional bending without rotational or translation anomaly.To date, this is the first case of subluxation without fracture in a child, presenting without neurological deficit and where spontaneous reduction occurred. In this case, conservative treatment was effective and the outcome at 2-year follow-up was excellent.
