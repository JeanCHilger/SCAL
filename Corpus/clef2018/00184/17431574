Traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation as part of a complex cervical spine injury. Case report in a 12-year-old girl. Traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) appears to be an unusual and almost universally fatal injury. Although AOD is the cause of death in about 10% of fatal cervical spine injuries an increasing number of reports document cases of survival following this injury. Improved pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency care according to ATLS guidelines that include early cervical spine stabilization, effective diagnosis because of improved imaging after trauma including whole body multislice CT followed by expeditious reposition and adequate immobilization are reasons for this phenomenon. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl surviving an AOD accompanied by a distraction injury C6/7 with unilateral fixed spinal luxation. After a primary attempt at closed reduction and external stabilization with a halo vest, the injury was treated by a navigated dorsal spondylodesis C0-C1 using the CerviFix rod system and open reposition of the remaining subluxation C6/7 with laminar hooks. The literature was reviewed for diagnostic possibilities, management and prognosis of AOD.
