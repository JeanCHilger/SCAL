Aneurysmal bone cysts. First description of the extensive destruction of the upper cervical spine. Aneurysmal bone cysts are not counted among the classic malignant tumors, although they are destructive locally as blood filled reactive bone lesions. Typically, they are found in the metaphysis of the long bones, while localizations on the spine are rare. A 16-year-old female patient presented with unspecific, progressive neck pain which had been present for half a year. The initial x-ray showed no noticeable pathology whatsoever. Subsequently, the complete destruction of the first cervical vertebrae was found. The tumor had completely infiltrated and completely surrounded the spinal chord. A combined approach was used as therapy: resection of the dorsal tumor portion with occipitocervical spondylodesis (C0-C4) and postoperative radiation of the remaining ventral portions. Currently, the patient is free of complaints and recurrence. The differential diagnosis of an aneurysmal bone cyst should also be considered in cases of unspecific cervical vertebral complaints in adolescents that are not otherwise explainable.
