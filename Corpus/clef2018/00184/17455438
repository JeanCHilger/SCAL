A short-term clinical evaluation of IPS Empress 2 crowns. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of all-ceramic crowns made with the IPS Empress 2 system after an observation period of 12 to 60 months.Seventy-nine IPS Empress 2 crowns were placed in 21 patients. The all-ceramic crowns were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and using clinical photographs. The evaluations took place at baseline (2 days after cementation) and at 6-month intervals for 12 to 60 months. Survival rate of the crowns was determined using Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis.Based on the US Public Health Service criteria, 95.24% of the crowns were rated satisfactory after a mean follow-up period of 58 months. Fracture was registered in only 1 crown. One endodontically treated tooth failed as a result of fracture at the cervical margin area.In this in vivo study, IPS Empress 2 crowns exhibited a satisfactory clinical performance during an observation period ranging from 12 to 60 months.
