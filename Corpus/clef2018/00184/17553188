Cervical extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma: case report demonstrating radiological features and management. Extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma is a rare tumour of mesenchymal origin, which is histologically similar to primary osseous Ewing's sarcoma. The majority of cases have been reported in the lower limb and paravertebral region, with a few cases reported in the neck.We report a patient with extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma presenting with a right-sided neck mass, vocal fold palsy and T1 nerve root involvement. The detection of characteristic features on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans, in conjunction with histological analysis, was required to make the diagnosis.Radiological imaging demonstrated that the tumour was infiltrating through the neural exit foramina of the lower cervical nerve roots, with encasement of the vertebral artery. The patient was managed with combination chemotherapy for systemic control and irradiation for local control.Extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma has a propensity to occur in a paravertebral location, being found rarely in the cervical region, and has a predilection to infiltrate through neural exit formina. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are helpful in the diagnosis of this rare tumour.
