Cervical meningomyelocele--an institutional experience. Cervical myelomeningoceles (CMMC) are a less common but distinct subgroup of myelomeningoceles. Their embryology and clinical characteristics vary from the more common thoracolumbar variant. Only a few small series have been published addressing this lesion in the literature with the largest one of them addressing nine patients. The authors present one of the largest series of cervical myelomeningoceles, review their embryology, clinical features, and their management strategies.This study included all the children who were managed for cervical myelomeningocele between Jan 2001 to July 2006 at our center.There were a total of ten children (five boys and five girls) operated on for cervical myelomeningoceles. The ages ranged between 2 months to 14 months. Neurological examination was normal in majority of the children with absence of gross orthopedic deformity in all the children. Three patients had associated hydrocephalus, two had Chiari malformation, and four of them had a syrinx. Surgical excision of the sac was performed for all.Cystic dysraphisms of the cervical differ embryologically, clinically, and structurally from thoracolumbar meningomyelocele and have a more favorable outcome. A good pre operative evaluation is recommended to assess any associated anomalies and identify the internal structures. Surgery excision of these lesions with intradural exploration of the sac to release any potential adhesion bands as well as other associated anomalies is recommended.
