Neurological outcome following early versus delayed lower cervical spine surgery. To determine whether the timing of surgery affects neurological outcome in patients with lower cervical spine trauma.29 patients with a fracture and 38 with a fracture-dislocation of C3 to C7 cervical vertebrae were treated operatively during the inclusive period January 1987 to December 2000. Surgery was performed as soon as the patient's medical condition allowed, within 72 hours in 31 and more than 72 hours after the injury in 36.Only patients with incomplete spinal cord injury had neurological improvement after surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in final neurological outcomes in patients having early as opposed to delayed surgery.Surgical intervention for cervical injuries is safe, as no postoperative neurological deterioration was recorded. Timing of surgery does not affect neurological outcome.
