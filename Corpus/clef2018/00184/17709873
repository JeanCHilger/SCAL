Ureteropelvic junction disruption and distal ureter injury associated with a Chance fracture following a traffic accident: a case report. A 10-year-old girl sustained a ureteropelvic junction disruption and distal ureter injury associated with the Chance fracture following a traffic accident. She was sitting on the rear seat of a car wearing a lap belt. Extensive small bowel mesenteric trauma was noted. Radiography revealed a left haemothorax with mediastinal shift and an unstable flexion-distraction vertebral fracture at L2 (Chance fracture). Subsequent intravenous pyelography demonstrated proximal extravasation from the right kidney without continuity to the upper and mid ureter, indicating a ureteropelvic junction avulsion or necrosis. Definitive surgery was delayed until day 33 because of urosepsis. Due to extensive small bowel resection, ischaemia of the ureter, and the history of urosepsis, a right subcapsular nephrectomy (rather than ureteral reconstruction) was considered the safest option for minimising further complications. It is important that trauma specialists recognise additional injuries after major trauma. Early use of a multidisciplinary approach is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality.
