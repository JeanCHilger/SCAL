Paediatric cervical spine injury but NEXUS negative. Cervical spine injuries in paediatric patients following trauma are extremely rare. The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) guidelines are a set of clinical criteria used to guide physicians in identifying trauma patients requiring cervical spine imaging. It is validated for use in children. A case of a child who did not fulfil the NEXUS criteria for imaging but was found to have a cervical spine fracture is reported.
