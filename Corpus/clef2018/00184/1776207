The whiplash injury. An overlooked and casually treated syndrome. The whiplash trauma is defined as hyperextension followed by hyperflexion of the cervical spine or the reverse. The lesion occurs mainly in the occupants of a motor vehicle into which another vehicle collides from behind. Even when there is no radiographic evidence of injury, considerable lesions of the soft tissues may, nevertheless, be present. Review of the literature and the present authors' investigations reveal that up to 80% of the patients have chronic symptoms and 10% of these are severe enough to cause incapacity. The therapeutic regimen has not been well investigated but, at present, intermittent cooling and support by a collar for a few days followed by rapid mobilizing and exercises within the limit of pain are recommended.
