Internal fixation of the odontoid: a newer approach to an old problem. A surgical approach to cervical spine instability associated with odontoid fracture is described. Internal fixation of the odontoid (IFO) has advantages over traditional posterior surgical treatments currently employed. This approach to the odontoid process is easier for the surgeon comfortable with anterior discectomy to perform than other techniques described in the spine literature.
