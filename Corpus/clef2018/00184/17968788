The spectrum of abdominal injuries associated with chance fractures in pediatric patients. With the increased use of seat belts in motor vehicles, the frequency of morbidity and mortality associated with motor vehicle accidents may have decreased but there is an associated rise in injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of intra-abdominal injury in children who sustained Chance-type fractures in a motor vehicle accident.A retrospective review was conducted of pediatric patients admitted for injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents between 1984 and 2001. Patients that sustained lumbar Chance fractures and an abdominal injury were reviewed.A total of 25 patients with lumbar Chance fractures were seen at our institution twelve had associated abdominal injuries. The mean age at the time of injury was 10.9 years and the most recent follow-up was a mean of 4.8 years after injury. All patients were involved in high-speed motor vehicle collisions. Eleven patients were restrained using a 2-point restraint and only one was restrained using a 3-point restraint.The abdominal injury patients had a significantly higher Chance fracture index than those patients who also suffered Chance fractures but no associated abdominal injuries. Success in the management of intra-abdominal injuries is dependent on the awareness that such an injury exists.
