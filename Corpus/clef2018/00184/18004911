Mandibular growth changes and cervical vertebral maturation. a cephalometric implant study. To evaluate mandibular dimensional changes and regional remodeling occurring during five intervals of circumpubertal growth.This investigation evaluated a unique sample of subjects in whom tantalum implants were placed into the craniofacial complex during childhood. The sample was obtained from the Mathews and Ware implant study originally conducted at the University of California San Francisco in the 1970s, with longitudinal cephalometric records of 20 subjects (13 female, 7 male) available for evaluation. Cephalograms at six consecutive stages of cervical vertebral maturation (CS1 through CS6) were analyzed.Peak mandibular growth was noted during the interval from CS3 to CS4. Forward rotation of the mandible was due to greater mandibular growth posteriorly than anteriorly. Progressive closure of the condylar-ramus-occlusal (CRO) angle resulted in a forward and upward orientation of the ramus relative to the corpus of the mandible due to increased vertical growth of the condyle.A peak in mandibular growth at puberty was substantiated. Mandibular remodeling and condylar rotation continue to occur after the growth spurt.
