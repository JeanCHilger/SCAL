Lumbar epidural hematoma associated with spondylolyses. This report describes 3 young male patients with multiple lumbar spondylolyses in combination with a symptomatic epidural hematoma. The records of all 3 patients were reviewed for clinical details. All patients were successfully treated without surgical intervention. Initial neuroimaging results for all patients revealed epidural hematomas, and follow-up imaging confirmed resolution of the hematomas. The relevant literature is briefly reviewed to examine the rarity of this combination. Spontaneous epidural hematomas may occur in the setting of spondylolysis, and this diagnosis should be considered when imaging reveals an unusual epidural lesion in a young active patient.
