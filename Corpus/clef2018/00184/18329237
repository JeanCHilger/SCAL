Voluminous mediastinal neurofibroma in a child. Neurogenic tumors account for 30% of mediastinal tumors in children. The thoracic region is the most common site for neurofibromas. We report a case of a voluminous neurofibroma in a small girl.After 8 months of paraplegia, a 4-year-old girl underwent thoracic radiography and computed tomography as well as magnetic resonance imaging of the spine. These revealed a huge mediastinal mass continuing into the vertebral canal and compressing the cord. Histological examination after surgery confirmed the diagnosis of neurofibroma. At the follow-up examination a month later, the paraplegia had resolved.Neurofibromas may manifest as solitary tumors or may be one manifestation of neurofibromatosis. In mediastinal neurofibroma, thoracic radiography, and computed tomography can show the tumor, posterior vertebral scalloping, and enlarged neural foramina. MR imaging provides the exact anatomic location, as well as any compression and displacement caused by the tumor. This information is essential for deciding the exact extent of resection. MRI may also be helpful in postoperative management.
