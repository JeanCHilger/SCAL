Pediatric extradural spinal tumors. We have reviewed 16 children with extradural spinal tumors, both benign and malignant, treated from 1998 to 2006 in Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India. The duration of symptomatology, clinical signs, radiological investigations, surgical approach, outcome and histopathological variation from the Western world was noted and evaluated. The age of these children ranged from 3 to 20 years. There were 11 boys and 5 girls. The duration of symptoms was 2-18 months, relatively longer in benign (mean 9.5 months) than malignant (mean 4.2 months) tumors. The follow-up ranged from 3 to 72 months and patients were graded preoperatively and postoperatively with the McCormick Functional Grading System. There was significant improvement in grade III-V patients, i.e. 74% of patients were grade III-IV at presentation, and only 35% at the last follow-up. There was deterioration from grade III to grade IV in 2 patients (PNET + metastatic adenocarcinoma) and 2 patients (neuroblastoma + Ewing's sarcoma) maintained their grades of IV and V, respectively. There was a wide range of histological variants seen in our series and the patients were treated primarily with a suitable surgical approach and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, wherever indicated.
