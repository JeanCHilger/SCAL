Interventional radiology: transoral approach to C2. To assess the value of a direct transoral approach to C2 for interventional procedures.A transoral approach to C2 was used in 4 patients (9-64 year old) with lytic lesion of the C2 vertebra and/or base of the odontoid over a 10 year period. Three patients underwent biopsy and 1 patient underwent vertebroplasty using biplane fluoroscopy. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using a 13G needle directly introduced in the C2 vertebra through the posterior pharyngeal wall.None of the patients reported ill-effects from the procedure. Needle placement was satisfactory in all patients, without technical difficulty. No technical complication was noted. Specifically, no infectious complication occurred.Our results indicate that a direct transoral approach to C2 is safe for biopsy or vertebroplasty.
