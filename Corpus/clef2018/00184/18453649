Anterior cervical fusion using the IntExt combined cage/plate. To review our first 30 patients who underwent anterior cervical fusion using IntExt and xenograft.Records of 23 men and 7 women aged 18 to 83 (mean, 40) years were reviewed by a single researcher. 23 patients had traumatic fracture-dislocations and 7 had degenerative disease. Pain, range of movement, neurological status, return-to-work status, kyphosis, and lordosis were recorded. Radiography and computed tomography were used to assess integration of the xenograft with the host bone, intervertebral fusion around the cage, and any screw loosening.The mean follow-up duration of the 30 patients was 14 (range, 1-47) months. There was no evidence of screw loosening or breakage. 20 of the 28 patients had no neck pain. Radiographs and/or computed tomographic scans of 23 patients showed bone union or clinical evidence of stability.The IntExt is effective in stabilising traumatic fractures. Although the literature does not support single-level plating in degenerative fractures (because of high success rates with autologous bone grafting), the IntExt has advantages of avoiding grafting complications, donor-site morbidity, and resorting to a postoperative collar.
