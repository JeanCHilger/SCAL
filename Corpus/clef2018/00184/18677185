Ankle paresis in incomplete spinal cord injury: relation to corticospinal conductivity and ambulatory capacity. There is limited data on the relation of corticospinal tract conductivity to clinical measures in incomplete spinal cord injury. This study examined the relationship of muscle strength to corticospinal tract input assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during static and dynamic conditions and to gait. Dorsiflexor strength was established by manual muscle test, maximal voluntary contraction, and maximal movement velocity, the latter being acquired during auditory-paced ankle movements. MEPs were elicited during isometric contractions with constant or continuously increasing ankle joint torque. Gait was assessed by quantifying its speed and independence. Linear regression analyses showed that maximal movement velocity was related to the MEP latencies and amplitudes in the dynamic condition (R(2)(adj.) = 0.62) and to the MEP latencies in the static condition (R(2)(adj.) = 0.45). Maximal voluntary contraction was only related to the MEP latencies in the static (R(2)(adj.) = 0.45) and the dynamic condition (R(2)(adj.) = 0.21), whereas manual muscle test did not show any relationship to the MEPs. In incomplete spinal cord injury patients, the dynamic measure maximal movement velocity might be a useful clinical assessment of corticospinal tract function. Clinical studies on recovery and repair of corticospinal tract function in spinal lesions could substantially benefit from implementing dynamic measures in the clinical assessment protocol.
