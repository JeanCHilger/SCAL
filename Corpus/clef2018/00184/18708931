All-terrain vehicles and associated spinal injuries. Case cohort.To illuminate factors associated with all-terrain vehicle (ATV) injuries and injury morphology.Traditionally thought of as safe, injuries associated with ATVs can be severe and life threatening. In 2005 alone, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated 136,100 injuries and 767 deaths associated with ATVs use and misuse.A database of all spine related consults from one institution was reviewed and all patients with spine or spinal cord injuries associated with ATV use were identified. All pertinent demographic, clinical, and radiographic information were collected and analyzed.Thirty-six patients were identified from the spinal cord injury database. The male:female ratio was 11:1 of the ATV injured patient. This is statistically different from the general database population, with a males representing 70% of patients (P < 0.002). The average ATV injured patient was 13.7 years younger than the average database patient (P < 0.001). The incidence of an axial compression or burst type fracture morphology was significantly higher in the ATV injured patient population (50%) compared with the database population as a whole (12%). Factors predisposing patients to injury on ATVs include excessive speed, use of alcohol or controlled substances, use of machinery after dark, and inexperience.All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are currently experiencing enormous popularity in the United States. These recreational vehicles are associated with a higher incidence of axial compression and burst-type fracture morphologies. In general, all-terrain vehicles although highly dangerous leading to death or serious injury can be fun, enjoyable, and safe if proper regulations and safety precautions are implemented and followed.
