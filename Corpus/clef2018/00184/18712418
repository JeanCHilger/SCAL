Mechanical spinal cord compression at the apex of a kyphosis: a propos of one case. Review of the literature. There are a few case reports in the literature on mechanical compressions of the spinal cord associated with Scheuermann's disease and the treatment is not codified. We describe a case of spinal cord compression at the apex of the kyphosis, which disappeared with the reduction of the deformity. Given the skeletal immaturity, anterior and posterior fusions had to be performed together in order to obtain a good result.
