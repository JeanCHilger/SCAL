Lateral mass screw fixation of complex spine cases: a prospective clinical study. The purpose of this paper was to report our experience with lateral mass screw fixation when used in a variety of complex cervical pathologies. A prospective observational study was undertaken of all patients who underwent lateral mass screw fixation for complex spinal pathology. There were 59 patients. Pathology included cervical spondylosis with deformity 58%, rheumatoid arthritis 19%, tumours 15%, multiple level trauma 8%. The median follow-up time was 23 months. The patient's myelopathy scores improved in 64% of patients. 79% reported an improvement in their neck disability scores. 73% had improvement in their visual analogue pain score. Sixty-one per cent had preoperative high signal change on T2WI MRI. Sixty per cent had loss of normal cervical lordosis on presentation or were kyphotic. Sixty-four per cent of patients had grade 3 compression on MRI (Singh). Postoperative alignment was maintained in all cases. No late kyphotic deformity occurred. Lateral mass screw fixation can be used effectively and safely for different cervical spine pathologies with good functional and radiological outcome.
