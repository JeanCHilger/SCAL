Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation after minor trauma. We present a case of atlantoaxial rotary subluxation after a minor injury managed by manual reduction under sedation. Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation should be considered in a child with inability or unwillingness to turn their head when history and physical examination do not suggest torticollis of benign etiology. In our discussion, we review etiology, diagnosis, as well as pre- and in-hospital management.
