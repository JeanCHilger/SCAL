Sagittal diameters measurements on MR of the cervical spinal cord in normal subjects. To offer normal reference of diameter of the cervical spinal cord and available diameter of cervical spinal canal and to screen scientific radiographic criteria to define and quantify cervical spinal cord disease.The magnetic resonance images of 120 normal people had been measured. The data of diameters of cervical spinal cord, CSF, M, the ratio of diameters of cord and CSF, and the ratio of diameters of cord and M had been collected and statistical analysis was made. And the relationships between the data above and each of gender, the length of C-spine and age were evaluated. In addition, the ratio of diameters of cord and CSF, and the ratio of diameters of cord and M was evaluated.The study showed that in healthy people, the diameters of cervical spinal cord, CSF and M was larger in the males than in the females, decreased with age, and increased with the length of C-spine but the diameter of CSF. And the ratio of diameters of cord and CSF increased with age and not affected by the length of C-spine. However, the ratio of diameters of cord and M was not affected by age and the length of C-spine.The ratio of diameters of cord and M is not affected by individual variation and can be used to evaluate cervical spinal cord atrophy, compression and impaired in patients with cervical myelopathy and can be important information in looking for clinically critical points.
