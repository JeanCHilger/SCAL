The odontoid process in Morquio-Brailsford's disease. The effects of occipitocervical fusion. High definition computed cervical myelograms have been made in flexion and extension in 13 patients with Morquio-Brailsford's disease. We observed that: 1) odontoid dysplasia was present in every case, with a hypoplastic dens and a detached distal portion which was not always ossified 2) atlanto-axial instability was mild, and anterior atlanto-axial subluxation was absent in most cases
