Pathomechanisms of spinal canal stenosis - upright MRI image gallery. Lumbar spinal canal stenosis is a common disease of the elderly patient, with a high prevalence and clinical importance. MRI is the established method of choice for the imaging of spinal canal stenosis. However, there is often a discrepancy between the clinical symptoms and the spinal canal stenosis as shown using MRI in a supine position. In such cases preoperative functional imaging is often warranted.In an image gallery three cases of a functional spinal canal stenosis of the lumbar spine are shown. In all three patients a dynamic, positional MRI (upright MRI) was performed.The pathomechanisms of the spinal canal stenosis could be shown in all three cases.Using upright MRI a functional spinal canal stenosis can be shown. The pathomechanisms of the spinal canal stenosis are discussed. The possibilities and limitations of this new imaging modality are presented and analysed.
