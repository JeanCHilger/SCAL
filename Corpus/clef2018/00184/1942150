The diagnostic value of interpediculate distance assessment on plain films in thoracic and lumbar spine injuries. In a retrospective study of 107 fractured vertebrae in the thoracic and lumbar spine, the interpediculate distance could be accurately assessed on plain roentgenograms in 96%. When these findings were compared with those of conventional tomography, there were no false-positive or false-negative results concerning normal or increased interpediculate distance. In 22 injured vertebrae the increased interpediculate distance was measured. In all these cases there was a fracture of the pedicle or lamina in addition to an injury of the vertebral body. We conclude that interpediculate distance can almost always be assessed and that an increased interpediculate distance on plain films is 100% reliable as an indicator of damage to the vertebral body, the pedicle, or lamina.
