Anesthetic management of a child with Down's syndrome having atlanto axial instability. Down's syndrome is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly in medical practice. These patients are of special concern to medical practice because of their associated problems with regard to respiratory, cardiovascular and other systemic problems. As these patients present for repeated surgeries like dental extraction, facial reconstruction and fixation of cervical spine, these patients pose challenges to the anesthesiologist because of their unique set of problems, namely atlantoaxial instability, small trachea, congenital heart disease and repeated chest infections due to lowered immunity. Their reactivity to inhalational anesthetics and atropine is variable. Here we present an interesting case report of a child with Down's syndrome who presented with atlantoaxial instability for MRI of cervical spine under general anesthesia.
