Case report: osteoid osteoma of the C2 pedicle: surgical technique using a navigation system. An osteoid osteoma of the cervical spinal pedicle is rare and carries a high surgical risk because of the close anatomic relationship to the spinal cord, nerve root, and vertebral artery. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with an osteoid osteoma of the C2 pedicle. Computed tomograms showed an oval nidus and marked sclerosis around this lesion at the right C2 pedicle. There also was expansion of the medial and inferior cortical bone of the C2 pedicle. After failure of nonoperative treatment, we planned surgery. Owing to concerns regarding thermal damage to the spinal cord, nerve root, and/or vertebral artery using computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation, we curetted the nidus using a navigation system. Twenty-eight months after surgery, her pain was relieved with no limitation of cervical movement and there has been no evidence of recurrence. Navigation allowed safe curettage of the nidus through a small hole while maintaining spinal stability.
