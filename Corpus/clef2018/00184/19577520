Botulinum toxin type A for neurogenic detrusor overactivity due to spinal cord lesions in children: a retrospective study of seven cases. To assess the effectiveness and safety of intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) used to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity in children.We retrospectively reviewed the records of seven children treated at least once (7/7: one injection 4/7: two and three injectionsSeven children received 18 injections. Social continence was achieved from the first injection. No further recurrent lower UTIs occurred. Maximum catheterized volume and reflex volume increased, and maximum detrusor pressure decreased. Detrusor compliance became interpretable and increased. Grade II right vesicoureteral reflux, present at baseline in one patient, resolved after BTA therapy. UTIs were the only adverse effects.Injection with BTA proved effective and safe in the short term. This may be an alternative to surgery in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity.
