Dysphagia in acute tetraplegics: a retrospective study. Retrospective study.Swallowing disorder in patients with tetraplegia represents a problem. Incidence and clinical data were examined to determine the influencing factors.Level I trauma Center, Berlin, Germany.Retrospective study (1 September 1997-31 December 2002) on hospitalized patients with acute tetraplegia. The patients' swallowing ability was examined both clinically and endoscopically, and the results correlated with clinical data.A total of 175 patients (144 (82.29%) male patients and 31 (17.71%) female patients (4.6:1) were studied. The peak age groups (43.45, +/-18.98, 14-89 years) were 20-30 years and over 60 years. C4-C6 were most commonly affected. Tetraplegia was trauma-related in 147 (84%) patients. Twenty-eight (16.0%) patients appeared to be suffering from a swallowing disorder on first feeding, 23 (82.14%) patients with dysphagia were tracheotomized. The level of tetraplegia (chi (2)=19.8 P<0.05), tracheotomy (chi (2)=21.7No single trigger for a swallowing disorder in acute tetraplegia was found. A combination of multiple factors (level of tetraplegia, severity of paralysis, tracheotomy, accompanying injuries and accompanying illnesses) restricts swallowing and compensation of changes, to the extent that a swallowing disorder becomes apparent.
