Lack of efficacy of manual therapy in children and adolescents with suspected cervicogenic headache: results of a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, and blinded trial. Clinical trials concerning cervical spine manipulation and mobilization in children and adolescents with cervicogenic headache are lacking.We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, and blinded trial in 52 children and adolescents (21 boys, 31 girls) aged 7-15. After prospective baseline documentation for 2 months patients were either assigned to placebo or true manipulation with another 2-month follow-up. Main outcome measures were defined as: percentage of days with headache, total duration of headache, days with school absence due to headache, consume of analgesics, intensity of headache.We did not find a significant difference comparing the groups with placebo and true manipulation with respect to the defined main outcome measures.We were not able to show an efficacy of cervical spine manipulation in 52 children and adolescents.
