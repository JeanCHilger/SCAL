Luque interpeduncular segmental fixation of the lumbosacral spine. Interpeduncular segmental fixation of the lumbar and lumbosacral spine with Luque screws and plates is becoming increasingly popular. In this retrospective study, 52 consecutive patients treated with this technique were followed for 16 to 44 months (average, 21). Indications for surgical arthrodesis included lumbar instability from degenerative disease (16 cases), spondylolisthesis (25 cases), pseudarthrosis (eight cases), fracture (two cases), and tumor (one case). Fusion with instrumentation spanned one level in nine patients, two in 38 patients, three in four patients, and four in one patient. Patients wore a rigid lumbar orthosis for an average of six months (range, two to 16). Ten complications occurred in nine patients: two superficial wound infections, four neurologic complications, three loosened screws, and one broken screw. An overall fusion rate of 96% was achieved pseudarthrosis is suspected in one case and failed arthrodesis secondary to trauma in a second patient. At four months postoperatively, solid unions had resulted in most of the cases, as seen roentgenographically. All patients reported decreased back pain
