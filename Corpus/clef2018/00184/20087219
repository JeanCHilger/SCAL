Significance of surgical treatment for severe dystrophic changes in the cervical spine associated with neurofibromatosis type I: a case report. There have been several reports about the treatments for dystrophic changes in the thoracic or lumbar spines owing to neurofibromatosis type-1. However, dystrophic changes in the cervical spine have been rarely reported. In this study, we present the case of a 13-year-old boy with severe dystrophic changes (dural ectasia) in the cervical spine owing to neurofibromatosis type-1. Although he had no neurological deficit, imaging studies revealed cervical kyphotic deformity and osteolysis of vertebral bodies. Thinning of vertebral bodies and laminae from C2 to C5 was remarkable, suggesting that the patient was at risk of suffering a spinal injury. The patient underwent cervical posterior fusion. At the 2-year follow-up examination, there was complete posterior bony fusion and no obvious progression.
