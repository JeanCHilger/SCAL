Unusual spinal tuberculosis with cord compression in an infant. Spinal abscess is rare in children, especially in young infants. The most common etiology is bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus in particular. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is another cause. We report an unusual cervical spinal abscess with spinal cord compression in a 13-month-old child. The presenting symptoms were weakness in the right arm and, predominantly, the right leg for 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an abscess of the cervical spine, extension with bony destruction, and spinal cord compression. The patient underwent an emergency neurosurgical decompression and laminectomy. Pathology and culture results confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After 12 months of antituberculosis treatment, the child could walk with a walker. At 37 months, he was able to walk without assistance. We conclude that spinal tuberculosis should be considered in cases of children with spinal cord-compression symptoms and an image showing an extraspinal abscess. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical for maximizing a functional recovery.
