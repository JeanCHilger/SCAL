Comparison of randomized treatments for late whiplash. To compare 4 different treatment strategies in patients with late whiplash syndrome.Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: infiltration, physiotherapy, or medication. Group allocation was stratified according to gender, age, and education. Additionally, patients of each group were randomized 1:1 to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or no CBT. Patients were assessed at baseline, after an 8-week treatment period, and 3 and 6 months later. Main outcome measures were subjective outcome rating, pain intensity, and working ability.Of 91 enrolled patients, 73 completed the study 62% were women. After treatment, 47 patients (64%) were subjectively improved (48%), or free of symptoms (16%), with a preponderance of women (73% vs 50%, p = 0.047). There was no difference regarding outcomes among the 3 treatment groups in men and women. The most robust difference was achieved with CBT, associated with a higher rate of recovery (23% vs 9%), and improvement (53% vs 42%) (p = 0.024), and with a gender difference (p = 0.01). All treatments significantly improved pain intensity and working ability.Intensive therapy in late whiplash syndrome can achieve improvement of different outcome measures including working ability in two-thirds of patients, more effective in women, persisting beyond 6 months in half. Additional cognitive-behavioral therapy was the most effective treatment modality.This interventional study provides Class III evidence that CBT used as an adjunct to infiltration, medication, or physiotherapy increases improvement rates in persons with late whiplash syndrome.
