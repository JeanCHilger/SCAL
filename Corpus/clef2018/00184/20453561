Cystic spinal dysraphism of the cervical region: experience with eight cases including double cervical and lumbosacral meningoceles. Cervical meningoceles are rare. Clinical, radiological and surgical data of 8 cases were presented, including a unique case of double cervical and lumbosacral meningoceles.This retrospective study included all children operated on for cervical meningocele from January 2004 to June 2009 at the Aburish Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University.Eight children (6 boys and 2 girls) were operated on. Their ages ranged between 2 months and 8 years. The clinical picture--apart form posterior cervical swelling--was almost normal. One case had paraplegia due to associated lumbosacral myelomeningocele (double meningocele). Four patients had associated hydrocephalus 2 had Chiari malformation and 2 hydromyelia.The outcome after surgery for these lesions is excellent as the majority of the children have no or minimal neurological deficit and surgery does help in improving cosmesis and preventing the development of neurological deterioration.
