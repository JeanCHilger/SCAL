Factors associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in premenopausal women undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the treatment of obesity. To evaluate bone metabolism, bone density (BMD) and vertebral fractures in morbidly obese individuals.Case series of 29 premenopausal obese patients, 15 of whom had been submitted to bariatric surgery. Serum calcium, albumin, PTH and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) were measured as well as bone densitometry of the lumbar spine and proximal femur, and lateral spine x-rays.High parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were recorded in 46.6% of the surgical patients and in 21.4% of the non-surgical patients (p = 0.245) 26.7% of the former and 28.6% of the latter revealed levels 25OHD < 30 ng/mL (p = 1.000). Calcium intake was higher in the surgical group (p = 0.004) along with lower serum calcium concentrations (p = 0.019). There were no significant differences in bone mineral density (BMD) or in the prevalence of vertebral fractures between groups.In premenopausal women undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass there is important intestinal calcium mal absorption which seems to be the main factor causing secondary hyperparathyroidism.
