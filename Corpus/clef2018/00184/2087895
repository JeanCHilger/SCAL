Axial osteosynthesis of dens axis fracture as a routine procedure in neurotraumatology. Diagnosis--Surgical-technique--Complications--Follow-up. A survey on 34 cases of odontoid process fractures treated by means of axial osteosynthesis since 1981. In cases of acute fractures rate of bony consolidation was 100%, in cases of pseudoarthrosis 50%. 6 complications until the first 20 weeks were successfully treated. No later complications. Removal of implanted material is usually not necessary. Operative treatment of non union by means of bony grafting, axial osteosynthesis and atlanto-axial arthrodesis seems to be helpful. Investigations for the best implantation model must be continued.
