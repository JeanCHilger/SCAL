Pedicle screw fixation of thoracic spinal fracture assisted by CT-based navigation system. To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of thoracic pedicle screw fixation when assisted by a CT-based navigation system.A total of 102 thoracic pedicle screws inserted by a CT-based navigation system (n = 24) (Group A) and 98 thoracic pedicle screws inserted by X-ray fluoroscopy (n = 22) (Group B) were observed by postoperative CT scan. The accuracy of both series was compared. And the process of navigation was investigated.Among Group A, 99 were of grade I (97.1%), 3 grade II and 0 grade III among Group B, 88 were of grade I (89.8%), 8 grade II and 2 grade III. One patient of grade III had the intractable pain of chest and back. Neural damage was not demonstrated. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).A CT-based navigation system can increase accuracy of thoracic pedicle screw fixation.
