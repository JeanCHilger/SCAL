Sports-related injury of the pediatric spine. Acute spinal injuries are fortunately rare in pediatric sports but can be catastrophic. Imaging is integral to the diagnosis and care of spinal trauma. Plain radiographs and CT are critical for detecting vertebral fracture, and MR imaging is an essential adjunct for evaluating muscular, ligamentous, and spinal cord injury. Back pain is a common complaint among athletes of all ages. The growing spine has unique weaknesses that result in a higher rate of detectable radiologic abnormalities. Disk pathology is less common in children, and is often uniquely associated with fracture of the ring apophyses. Spondylolysis is far more prevalent in youth athletes than in their adult counterparts, requiring a different approach to imaging for assessment of adolescent back pain.
