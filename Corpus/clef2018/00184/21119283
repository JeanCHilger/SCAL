Spinal cord compression caused by anaplastic large cell lymphoma in an HIV infected individual. Lymphomas occur with an increased frequency in patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. These are usually high-grade immunoblastic lymphomas and primary central nervous system lymphomas. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a distinct type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is uncommon in HIV infected individuals. We describe here an uncommon presentation of this relatively rare lymphoma in the form of spinal cord compression syndrome in a young HIV infected individual.
