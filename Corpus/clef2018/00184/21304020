Functional electrical stimulation therapy of voluntary grasping versus only conventional rehabilitation for patients with subacute incomplete tetraplegia: a randomized clinical trial. Functional electrical stimulation therapy (FET) has a potential to improve voluntary grasping among individuals with tetraplegia secondary to traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).This single-site, randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of 40 hours of FET with conventional occupational therapy (COT) compared with COT alone to improve grasping.Twenty-four subjects with subacute traumatic incomplete SCI (C4-C7, AIS B-D) consented to participate in 40 hours of therapy over 8 weeks, beyond the conventional rehabilitation program. Subjects were randomized to receive FET + COT (n = 9) or COT (n = 12). The key outcomes were changes in Functional Independence Measure (FIM) self-care subscores, Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) self-care subscores, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Hand Function Test (TRI-HFT) performed at baseline and follow-up.At the end of the treatments, the change in mean FIM self-care subscore for the FET + COT group was 20.1 versus 10 (P = .015) for the COT group. Subjects randomized to FET + COT also had greater improvements in the SCIM and TRI-HFT. No longer term follow-up was feasible.FET significantly reduced disability and improved voluntary grasping beyond the effects of considerable conventional upper extremity therapy in individuals with tetraplegia.
