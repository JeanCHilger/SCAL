Custom fitted thermoplastic Minerva jackets in the treatment of cervical spine instability in preschool age children. The options for cervical spine stabilization have traditionally been the Minerva jacket (MJ) or the halo brace. In the preschool age child both of these devices have significant drawbacks the halo brace because of its erosion and difficulty providing adequate fixation due to the thin calvarium of the young child and the MJ because of its bulk and weight. With the advent of polyethylene plastics, MJs are a more viable option without the disadvantages noted above. Six cases of cervical spine instability in preschool age children treated with a custom-molded MJ are presented. All patients achieved cervical spine stability with minimal morbidity. This technique is recommended as an alternative to the halo brace, as it provides reliable and satisfactory treatment of these difficult problems in preschool children.
