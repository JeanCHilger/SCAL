Submaximal exercise responses in tetraplegic, paraplegic and non spinal cord injured elite wheelchair athletes. It remains unclear whether similar exercise prescription, based on physiological markers, can be applied to subgroups of wheelchair athletes with different disabilities. Therefore, 25 wheelchair athletes, divided into three subgroups [eight tetraplegic (TETRA), nine paraplegic (PARA) and eight non spinal cord injured (NON-SCI)], performed an exercise test consisting of incremental submaximal stages, covering a range from 40% to 80% peak oxygen uptake (%VO(2peak) ). Oxygen uptake (VO(2)), heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (BLa) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained for each stage. Expressed as a function of BLa, no differences were found between subgroups with respect to %VO(2peak) (group mean ± SD: 1.0 mmol/L: 53.9 ± 9.9% 2.0 mmol/L: 70.7 ± 7.5%
