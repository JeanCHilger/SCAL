Cervical spine instability following resection of benign intradural extramedullary tumours in children. Benign intradural extramedullary (IDEM) tumours in children are usually neural sheath derivatives or are dura based. Total resection of these benign tumours is the primary surgical goal. A management issue related to their occurrence in the growing paediatric spine is a higher propensity for the development of postlaminectomy kyphosis, especially in the upper cervical spine, than what is seen in adults.A retrospective study was performed on 22 patients to analyse the incidence, presentation and management of postoperative kyphotic deformities in children who underwent laminotomy and tumour excision for benign cervical IDEM tumours.The incidence of postoperative kyphosis was 13%. All these patients underwent subsequent posterior fusion following reduction of the deformity with good results.Following excision of cervical intradural lesions, paediatric patients need to be followed up regularly to rule out the development of postsurgical deformities especially in the upper cervical spine region. Various biomechanical, surgical and tumour-related factors which influence the development of deformities are reviewed.
