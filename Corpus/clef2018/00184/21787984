Multidetector computed tomography of spinal trauma: a pictorial review. Spinal trauma is 1 of the major causes of disability that commonly affects young adults, and radiologists play a crucial role in the evaluation of acutely traumatized patients. With the advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), the algorithm of imaging of spinal trauma has changed dramatically and MDCT is now established as the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of spinal trauma. The appearance on MDCT of the spinal injury depends on the mechanism of the injury, which also determines the stability of the injury. This pictorial essay describes the MDCT appearances, mechanism, and stability of commonly encountered traumatic spinal injuries.
