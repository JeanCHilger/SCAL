Incidence of acute hepatitis B in patients with spinal cord injury. Retrospective case survey.To examine incidence and clinical characteristics of hepatitis B infection in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).Inpatient clinic within a physical medicine and rehabilitation hospital specialized in rehabilitation.A total of 161 patients with SCI.Patients' records were investigated and the status of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), anti-hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, alanine aminotransferase levels, duration of hospitalization and cost were recorded.Incidence of acute hepatitis B.Six patients were diagnosed with acute hepatitis B on the first hospitalization for rehabilitation. A total of 11 patients (4.2%) were HBsAg positive with a previously established diagnosis of hepatitis B virus infection, 1 patient (0.4%) was anti-HCV positive. After a follow-up of 6 months, three of the acute hepatitis B patients progressed into chronic hepatitis B stage. In acute hepatitis B patients' initiation of the rehabilitation was delayed, duration of hospitalization was increased.After SCI, patients are at high risk of acute hepatitis B infection. A high rate of chronicity may be associated with impaired immune response, secondary to neurological deficit. Screening and vaccination protocols may prevent the spread of the hepatitis B infection, healthcare losses and financial loss.
