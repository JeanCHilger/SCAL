Skeletal maturation evaluation using mandibular second molar calcification stages. To investigate (1) the relationships between the stages of mandibular second molar calcification and skeletal maturity and (2) whether second molar calcification stages can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool to determine skeletal maturity.Samples were derived from panoramic radiographs and lateral cephalograms of 300 subjects (137 males and 163 females) with ages ranging from 9 to 18 years, and estimates of dental maturity (Demirjian Index [DI]) and skeletal maturity (cervical vertebrae maturation indicators [CVMI]) were made.A highly significant association (C*  =  0.854 for males and 0.866 for females) was found between DI and CVMI. DI stage E corresponded to stage 2 of CVMI (pre-peak of pubertal growth spurt) and DI stages F and G corresponded to stages 3 and 4 of CVMI (peak of pubertal growth spurt). DI stage H was associated with stages 5 and 6 of CVMI (end of pubertal growth spurt).A highly significant association exists between DI and CVMI. Mandibular second molar DI stages are reliable indicators of skeletal maturity.
