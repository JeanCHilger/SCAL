Ossification patterns of the atlas vertebra. The objective of this study was to characterize ossification patterns of the C1 (atlas) vertebra in children, to better differentiate normal variants from traumatic injury.A retrospective review of all sinus and temporal bone CT examinations was performed for the period of 2002-2009. Patients 96 months old or younger for whom C1 level was at least partially imaged were included. Patients with a history of trauma or genetic disorder-associated spinal abnormalities were excluded.A total of 1270 CT examinations were reviewed. The anterior arch of C1 was completely imaged in 841 patients (66%), and the posterior arch was completely imaged in 378 patients (30%). Multiple anterior arch ossification centers were observed in 179 of 841 patients (21%), and posterior arch variants were present in nine of 378 patients (2%). At least partial ossification of the anterior arch was seen in 113 of 147 children (77%) younger than 25 months, whereas only 14 of the remaining 694 children (2%) older than 24 months failed to show any ossification. Incomplete ossification of the anterior arch was noted in 47 of 103 patients (46%) in the 85-96-month-old category. The posterior arches were at least partially ossified in all children. Incomplete fusion of the posterior synchondrosis was seen in 17 of 108 patients (16%) older than 60 months.C1 ossification patterns and timing of synchondrosis fusion are variable. Knowledge of these patterns is important to better differentiate a normal variant from traumatic injury.
