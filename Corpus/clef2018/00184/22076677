Clinical results of posterior stabilization without decompression for thoracolumbar burst fractures: is decompression necessary? The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome of posterior stabilization without decompression for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Thirty-one consecutive cases of thoracolumbar fractures involving T11-L2 stabilized by a pedicle screw system were reviewed. Neither reduction of the height of a fractured body nor any decompression procedure was added during surgery. Twenty-two patients had incomplete paraplegia one patient had complete paraplegia. Neurological recovery and remodeling of the spinal canal were evaluated. Neurological status was evaluated at the time of injury, just before and after surgery, and at final follow-up. The degree of spinal canal compromise was assessed using axial CT scan images. The duration of follow-up averaged 39.6 months. The mean spinal canal compromise at the time of injury was 41.6%, and no significant correlation was observed between the degree of canal compromise and the severity of the neurological deficit. Within 2-3 weeks, spinal canal remodeling had started in all patients whose spinal canal compromise was more than 30%, and canal compromise had decreased significantly 3-4 weeks after injury. Seventeen of 22 patients with incomplete paraplegia had already shown partial neurological recovery even before surgery. At the final follow-up, all patients with incomplete paraplegia had improved by at least one modified Frankel grade. This study suggests that the effect of decompressing thoracolumbar fractures with neurological deficits remains unclear and questions the need to operate simply to remove retropulsed bone fragments. Posterior stabilization without decompression should constitute appropriate surgical treatment for these fractures.
