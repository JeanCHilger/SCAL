Fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine in children and adolescents. Only 1.5-2% of all fractures in children and adolescents are fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Treatment is most often conservative. This study compares the own experience with the recent literature.Over a 48 month period all patients with fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine, younger than 16 years were included prospectively. Of the patients 67 underwent follow-up investigations after 3-36 months.The average age of the patients was 11.9 years. Sports (53%) and traffic (28%) accidents were most frequent. Fractures most often appeared in the mid-thoracic (47%) and thoracolumbar spine (41%). Operative treatment was performed in 9 cases (10.4%). Secondary loss of alignment was not observed neither after conservative nor operative treatment. Neurological deficits (n=2) did not completely improve.Most fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine heal fast and without any sequelae. Unstable fractures of type B and C (exclusively occurring as a result of traffic accidents) need operative stabilization as in adults.
