Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema due to blunt neck injury: a case report and review of the literature. Minor blunt neck injury from childhood trauma is a relatively common condition which can be potentially life-threatening in only rare circumstances. Pneumomediastinum may develop in up to 10% patients who have sustained blunt cervical or thoracic trauma and may be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in affected individuals because of the associated damage to the oesophagus, larynx or trachea. Management of this condition varies from conservative approach with close observation and antibiotherapy to surgical interventions, depending on the extent and severity of aerodigestive injuries. We present a paediatric blunt neck trauma accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum secondary to a bicycle accident (neck striking the handlebar). Its radiologic appearance, clinical presentation, and the options for initial management in the emergency department (ED) are reviewed.
