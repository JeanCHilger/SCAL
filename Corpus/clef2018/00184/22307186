Non-operative treated spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma in a 12-year-old boy. Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) has been reported as a rare condition especially in childhood. Because its symptoms are atypical, it is not easy to diagnose the onset of SSEH. However, with wider use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), several SSEH cases, especially not requiring surgical intervention, have been reported. We report on a 12-year-old boy who presented with a 5-day history of progressive pain in his back and extremities and numbness of his lower legs. An MRI of the spine demonstrated a dorsal epidural hematoma extending from C4 to T4, and the axial scan of the MRI revealed a posterior hematoma. Neurological deficit was estimated as not severe and not progressive, therefore surgery was postponed, and the patient was discharged without surgical intervention. Seven months later, MRI and myelography were performed, and we confirmed that the spinal epidural hematoma was absorbed. There have been some cases showing spontaneous regression of SSEH, and in younger than 18 years old, most of those cases that were treated with hematopathy such as hemophilia and spontaneous regression after SSEH correlated to larger size of hematoma. Because of bleeding tendencies in these cases the spinal cord was not pressed by the hematoma this contributed conclusively to the prognosis. On the contrary, the 12-year-old boy, not having bleeding tendency, had the larger lesion of SSEH and recovered spontaneously without surgical intervention. Evaluation of MRI findings and neurological deficits in SSEH cases is important for deciding the indication of surgical intervention.
