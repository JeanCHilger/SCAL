Retroclival epidural hematoma in a child affected by whiplash cervical injury: a typical case of a rare condition. Traumatic posterior fossa epidural hematomas are uncommon lesions. Among these lesions, retroclival epidural hematomas (REDH) are particularly rare conditions that usually occur in the pediatric population due to predisposing anatomical features in this patient group. We describe a typical case of traumatic REDH from the mechanism of trauma to outcome. This 8-year-old girl was involved in a motor vehicle accident leading to whiplash cervical injury and cranial nerve palsy. Any children involved in a severe motor vehicle accident with such a sequence of events should raise suspicion for prompt diagnosis.
