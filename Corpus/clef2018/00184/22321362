Corpectomy with titanium cage reconstruction in the cervical spine. Multi-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been utilized by many surgeons to address multi-level cervical disease with the use of autograft or allograft. High failure rates have been reported in three-level decompressions when autograft is used, which increases with the use of allograft. This has led many surgeons to advocate anterior cervical corpectomy with strut grafting where only two surfaces are needed for fusion compared to the multiple surfaces required for multi-level ACDF. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of titanium cage use with autologous bone graft (resected vertebral bodies) and anterior cervical plating in 38 consecutive patients (aged 18-73 years) undergoing cervical decompression and corpectomy. Medical records were examined along with an outcome interview conducted in-person or by phone. Postoperative immobilization was achieved with a rigid cervical collar. Fusion was assessed by antero-posterior (AP), lateral, and flexion-extension radiographs and cervical spine CT scans. Fusion was assessed by AP, lateral, and flexion-extension radiographs and cervical spine CT scans. Clinical results included an exit interview. Solid bony fusion with graft incorporation was found in 37 of 38 patients (97.5%) at six months and 100% in one year. Compared to preoperative levels, 84% of patients rated their overall quality of life to have improved by 50% or greater and would have the same surgery again given the same conditions. There were few complications. Thus, titanium cage reconstruction with the use of autologous bone from a corpectomy and the use of an anterior cervical plate is an effective means of reconstruction after decompressive cervical corpectomy, and we conclude this is a viable alternative to multi-level ACDF or to procedures involving long strut grafts obtained from the patient or bone bank.
