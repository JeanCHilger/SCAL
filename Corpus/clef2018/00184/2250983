Initial factors predicting functional performance in patients with traumatic tetraplegia. The authors present a prospective analysis of the functional outcome in 99 patients with traumatic tetraplegia consecutively admitted to the Pellegrin Hospital (University Hospital, Bordeaux, France). There was a 29% death rate. Eighteen months after injury, 33% of the patients were dependent (not able to perform activities of daily living without the presence of a helping individual), 38% were independent. Two predictors of independence (age and initial Yale Scale Score) were found by a statistical analysis of the course of the disorder.
