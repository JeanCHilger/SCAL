Patient safety in the rehabilitation of children with spinal cord injuries, spina bifida, neuromuscular disorders, and amputations. Pediatric patient safety continues to challenge both pediatricians and pediatric physiatrists. While there is a trend toward developing general patient safety initiatives, there is little research on pediatric patient safety. This article identifies major areas of general safety risk, with a focus on timely diagnosis and care coordination to prevent secondary complications that compromise health, function, and quality of life in pediatric neuromuscular disease, spinal cord disorders, and amputation.
