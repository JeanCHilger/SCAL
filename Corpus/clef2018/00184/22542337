Diagnosable and non-diagnosable causes of death by postmortem computed tomography: a review of 339 forensic cases. Postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) is often used to diagnose causes of death, especially in nations with a low autopsy rate. To identify the causes of death that can and cannot be determined by PMCT, imaging findings were reviewed in 339 consecutive forensic autopsy cases. Causes of death could be determined based on PMCT findings alone in 7% of these cases, based on suggestive PMCT findings with additional information in 54%, and could not be determined by PMCT in 38%. PMCT screening may be useful for establishment of some causes of death, including traumatic intracranial hematoma, endogenous intracranial hemorrhage, and some cases of cardiac rupture. Suggestive findings from PMCT in other cases, such as those involving subarachnoid hemorrhage or pericardial hematoma, can lead to misdiagnosis and may be a pitfall of PMCT screening. Causes of death including some cases of cervical cord injuries, asphyxiation, burn, drug intoxication, acute myocardial infarction, and pulmonary thromboembolism cannot be diagnosed using PMCT.
