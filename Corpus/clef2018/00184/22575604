Use of the CTrach Laryngeal Mask Airway in adult patients: a retrospective review of 126 cases. To evaluate the effectiveness of the CTrach Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) when used electively.Retrospective analysis.Operating room of an academic hospital.Data from 126 patients who were electively intubated with the CTrach LMA over a 16-month period were reviewed. Each patient's weight, height, ASA physical status classification, Mallampati score, thyromental distance, and cervical spine range of motion were recorded.Successful ventilation was achieved in 100% of patients, while successful intubation was achieved in 89.7% of patients. The most common reason for failure to intubate was poor airway visualization and the inability to appropriately position the device anterior to the vocal cords.The major advantage of the CTrach LMA is that it is the only device that allows airway visualization during patient ventilation however, it does not have 100% success with intubation.
