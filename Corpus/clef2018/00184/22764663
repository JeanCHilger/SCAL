A rare case of intradural spinal hydatid cyst in a paediatric patient. Intradural extramedullary type of spinal hydatid disease is a rare variety of hydatid disease, and is even rarer in paediatric age group. Spinal hydatid disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spinal cord compression syndrome in endemic countries and should be evaluated with imaging and serological investigations. Our case was a 9- year-old boy who presented with lower back pain lasting for 8 months and progressive bilateral lower extremities weakness lasting for 2 month. Neurological examination was suggestive of lower motor neuron type of paraperesis. Magnetic resonance images of the lumbar spine showed an intradural cystic lesion displacing and compressing the lower cord and cauda equina. The cystic mass was explored with L1-L4 laminectomy and after durotomy it was separated from cord and dura mater by hydrodissection. It contained a clear fluid. The pathological diagnosis was hydatid disease.
