Treatment of posttraumatic syringomyelia. This paper presents results of a prospective study for patients undergoing surgery for posttraumatic syringomyelia between 1991 and 2010.A group of 137 patients with posttraumatic syringomyelia were evaluated (mean age 45 ± 13 years, mean follow-up 51 ± 51 months) with pre- and postoperative MRI and clinical examinations presenting in this period and followed prospectively by outpatient visits and questionnaires. Surgery was recommended for symptomatic patients with a progressive course. Short-term results were determined within 3 months of surgery, whereas long-term outcomes in terms of clinical recurrences were studied with Kaplan-Meier statistics.Three groups were distinguished according to the type of trauma: Group A, patients with spinal trauma but without cord injury (ASIA E, n = 37) Group B, patients with an incomplete cord injury (ASIA C or D, n = 55)The technique of decompression with arachnolysis, untethering, and duraplasty at the level of the underlying trauma provides good long-term results for patients with progressive neurological symptoms following ASIA A, B and E injuries. Treatment of patients with posttraumatic syringomyelia after spinal cord injuries with preserved motor functions (ASIA C and D) remains a major challenge. Future studies will have to establish whether thecoperitoneal shunts would be a superior alternative for this subgroup.
