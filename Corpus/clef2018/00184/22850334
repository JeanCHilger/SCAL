Life care planning projections for individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury before and after locomotor training intervention:  a case series. We present a retrospective case series of 2 individuals with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) to examine differences in lifetime cost estimates before and after participation in an intensive locomotor training (LT) program. Sections of a life care plan (LCP) were used to determine the financial implications associated with equipment, home renovations, and transportation for patients who receive LT. An LCP is a viable method of quantifying outcomes following any therapeutic intervention.The LCP cases analyzed were a 61-year-old woman and a 4½-year-old boy with motor-incomplete SCI and impairments classified by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) as AIS D and AIS C, respectively.Each patient received an intensive outpatient LT program 3 to 5 days per week. The 61-year-old woman received 198 sessions over 57 weeks and the 4½-year-old boy received 76 sessions over 16 weeks.The equipment, home renovation, and transportation costs of an LCP were calculated before and after LT. Prior to the implementation of LT, the 61-year-old woman had estimated lifetime costs between $150,247.00 and $199,654.00. Following LT, the estimated costs decreased to between $2010.00 and $2446.00 (a decrease of $148,237.00 and $197,208.00). Similarly, the 4-year-old boy had estimated lifetime costs for equipment, home renovation, and transportation between $535,050.00 and $771,665.00 prior to LT. However, the estimated costs decreased to between $97,260.00 and $200,047.00 (a decrease of $437,790.00 and $571,618.00) following LT.The lifetime financial costs associated with equipment, home renovations, and transportation following a motor-incomplete SCI were decreased following an intensive LT program for the 2 cases presented in this article. The LCP, including costs of rehabilitation and long-term medical and personal care costs, may be an effective tool to discern cost benefit of rehabilitation interventions.
