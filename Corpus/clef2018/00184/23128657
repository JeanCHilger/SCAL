The use of methylprednisolone in acute spinal cord injury: a review of the evidence, controversies, and recommendations. The use of methylprednisolone after acute spinal cord injury has been under discussion for more than 20 years. There is ongoing debate about the efficacy and clinical impact of methylprednisolone in recovery from spinal cord injury, and studies show considerable variability in practice patterns among surgeons. Consensus statements consider methylprednisolone as a treatment option for acute spinal cord injury, but not a standard of care based on available evidence. This review discusses the evidence from prospective trials of methylprednisolone in adults and teenagers after spinal cord injury, consensus statements on the use of methylprednisolone, and practice variability in North America and the United Kingdom over time.
