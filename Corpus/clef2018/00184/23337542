Clinical outcomes of treatment for spinal cord compression due to primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the spine (PNHLS) with spinal cord compression is an extremely rare disease in clinical practice. The optimal treatment options for this disease have been controversial and pose a challenge for the clinicians.To provide some useful insight into the treatments, outcomes, and prognostic factors of PNHLS.Retrospective analysis.The authors collected 40 patients' data with primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the mobile spine, and these patients presented with spinal cord compression as a first symptom between 1998 andÂ 2010.The posttreatment neurologic status, general status, local recurrence, and survival were noted according to the telephone calls, letters, or follow-up visits in the outpatient department.Multidisciplinary treatments, including surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, were performed in this series. Follow-ups regarding treatment outcomes, local recurrence, and survival rates were carried out and analyzed. The prognostic factors including age, neurologic status, general status, vertebrae involvement, and treatment outcomes were determined.The median age of the patients was 52 years (range, 13-79 years). After treatments, 30 patients (75%) reached a complete remission (CR). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of all patients was 72.9%. Patients who were younger than 60 years, with single vertebra involvement, or had CR after treatment had higher 5-year OS (p<.05). In multivariate analysis, CR after treatment and involvement of a single vertebra were identified as favorable prognostic factors for OS.Patients with PNHLS with neurologic compression had distinct clinical features. Regarding treatment, the authors emphasized the importance of multidisciplinary management and the optimal operating juncture. Patients with excellent response to the treatment and single vertebra involvement had better survival.
