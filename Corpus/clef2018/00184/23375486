Clinical signs and radiographic evidence of esophageal perforation after tetraplegia. A diagnosis of esophageal perforation at some time after cervical spine surgery is difficult to establish since there exists no clinical picture specific to tetraplegic patients. We carried out a detailed retrospective study of revelatory clinical manifestations and conventional radiographic data in a series of 16 patients hospitalized at HÃ´pital Henry-Gabrielle (Lyon, France) for rehabilitation purposes between 1983 and 2010 and who presented this complication. The most frequent clinical picture associates cervical pain, fever and dysphagia. Simple front and side X-rays of the cervical spine led in 77% of the cases to a diagnosis of esophageal perforation. The most prevalent radiographic signs of the latter consist in osteosynthesis hardware or instrumentation failure, prevertebral free air next to the cervical esophagus and enlarged prevertebral space. Visualized esophageal X-rays, also known as series, highlight parenchymal opacity next to the posterior wall of the esophagus. A diagnosis of esophageal perforation needs to be carried out in order to facilitate suitable treatment and avoid the compromising of vital functions.
