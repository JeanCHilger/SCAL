Radiographic and intraoperative imaging of a hemisection of the spinal cord resulting in a pure Brown-Séquard syndrome: case report and review of the literature. Brown-Séquard plus syndrome (BSPS) or incomplete spinal cord injuries from stab injury have been widely reported. However, only four detailed cases of pure Brown-Séquard syndrome (BSS) from stab injury have been previously reported. Here we present the case of an 18-year-old man who sustained a penetrating knife stab injury to the right side of his back resulting in a pure Brown-Séquard syndrome with left lower extremity hemiplegia. Imaging revealed right-sided soft tissue and ligamentous damage traveling in a right-to-left fashion as well as left-sided T2-weighted MRI cord signal change at the level of T9. Given concern for a cerebrospinal fluid leak (CSF) leak, the patient was taken for wound exploration, irrigation, laminectomy, dural closure and lumbar drain placement. At three years follow up, the patient was almost full strength. This is the first case in the literature demonstrating radiographic and correlative intraoperative imaging of a hemisection of the spinal cord resulting in a pure Brown-Séquard syndrome.
