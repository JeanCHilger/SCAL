Analysis of X-rays of cervical imbalances syndrome before and after the treatment of osteopathy and traction intervention in 187 youth cases. To observe X-ray features of before and after treatment of cervical imbalance syndrome with osteopathy and traction intervention in youth patients, then to investigate the clinical effect of the treatment of the cervical imbalances syndrome in youth by osteopathy.From September 2007 to December 2010, one hundred and eighty-seven students of 19 to 22 years (means 21 years) with neck pain as the main symptom in Beijing university of Chinese medicine were selected and divide them into osteopathy group and traction groups randomly. In osteopathy group, there were 94 patients including 40 males and 54 females in traction group, there were 93 patients including 42 males and 51 females. The treatment of osteopathy group lasted for 3 weeks,three times per weekThe osteopathy group:94 cases, before treatment, abnormal curvature in 57 cases, spinous position change in 45 cases and angular displacement in 44 cases, vertebral sliding in 15 cases, Ruth Jackson line intersect proneness change in 70 cases,stretch change in 47 cases after treatment, abnormal curvature in 35 cases, spinous position change in 24 cases and angular displacement in 18 cases, vertebral sliding in 3 cases, Ruth Jackson line intersect proneness change in 41 cases, extension change in 33 cases(1) Pathological changes can be called youth cervical imbalance syndrome. (2) Stress points, angular displacement, cervical vertebral slip, curvature straightened, spinous position change are main X-ray performances. (3) Both osteopathy and traction intervention on are efficient in youth neck pain. (4) Youths cervical vertebra imbalance is early but reversible performance.
