Anterior decompression and fixation with Webb-Morley procedure in dorsolumbar spinal injury. To evaluate the neurological outcome of anterior decompression and fixation with Webb-Morley procedure in dorsolumbar spinal injuries.A case series study.The Neurosurgery Department, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from May 2008 to July 2010.Patients with post-traumatic unstable dorsolumbar spine having compression of the spinal cord with bony fragments of the fractured vertebra were included in the study. Patients below the age of 15 years and patients with bed sores and unfit for anaesthesia were excluded. Plain X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were done. All patients were treated for dorsolumbar fractures by anterior decompression and fixation with Webb-Morley procedure. All patients were assessed clinically by the Frankel's grading before and after surgery.Among 60 patients, 41 were males and 19 were females. Mean age was 37.2 Â± 4 years. Major cause of trauma was road traffic accident. The commonest level of the fracture was at the dorsolumbar junction i.e. 71.66% (n = 43). About 19 (31.66%) patients improved to the Frankel's grade-E, while 41.66% (n = 25) improved to grade-D after surgery. There was no postoperative mortality.According to the current study, anterior decompression and fixation with Webb-Morley procedure is an effective and safe approach. Those patients who had complete motor deficit showed no improvement in power but those who had partial motor deficit, had excellent improvement.
