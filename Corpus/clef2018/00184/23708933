Spontaneous spinal epidural haematoma mimicking meningitis in a 2-year-old child--a case report and literature review. We report the case of a 2-year-old boy with suspected meningitis who presented with acute onset neck pain and stiffness associated with right-sided weakness and ataxia.Despite intravenous antibiotics and antiviral treatment, his condition deteriorated. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spontaneous cervical epidural haematoma (C4-C7) extending down to thoracic (T7) level with associated compression of the spinal cord. He was treated successfully by neurosurgical decompression and made a complete recovery.Spinal epidural haematoma is a neurosurgical emergency characterised by extravasation of blood in the spinal epidural space. The clinical presentation particularly in young children can masquerade other conditions such as meningitis. In this article, we discuss our case and review the literature on spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma with an aim to improve awareness of this condition which if not recognised and treated early can lead to significant lifelong morbidity.
