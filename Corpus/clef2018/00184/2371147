Delayed cervical central cord syndrome after trivial trauma. Spinal cord injuries in children usually result from significant trauma. Two children with a delayed cervical central cord syndrome following trivial trauma are reported, one with no predisposing factor and one with a Chiari I malformation. Although dissimilar, these cases emphasize the importance of an evaluation for an anatomic defect or congenital anomaly in the patient with neurologic dysfunction following trivial trauma. We discuss the differential diagnosis of this rare entity and suggest that early recognition and treatment may improve patient prognosis.
