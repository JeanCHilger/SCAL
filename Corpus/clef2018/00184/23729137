Management of Klippel-Feil syndrome combined with Turner syndrome: a case report. A 12-year-old female with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) combined with Turner syndrome (TS) and a submucous cleft palate (CP) was presented. The patient reportedly had TS and had received growth hormone (GH) therapy. Because of her skeletal Class III pattern with a steep mandibular plane angle, facial asymmetry, and fused cervical vertebrae, the effects of the GH on her craniofacial complex needed to be considered at the start of orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. To manage submucous CP with severe maxillary deficiency, a rigid external distraction (RED) device was used. The total active treatment time was 34 months including distraction osteogenesis (DO). Treatment improved both her occlusion and facial appearance.
