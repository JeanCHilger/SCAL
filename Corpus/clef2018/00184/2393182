Radiologic diagnosis of epiglottitis: objective criteria for all ages. A retrospective study was undertaken to define objective radiologic parameters in diagnosing epiglottitis on soft-tissue lateral neck radiographic studies. Ratios of soft-tissue structures in 31 patients aged 7 months to 61 years with epiglottitis were compared with those of age- and sex-matched controls with croup, pharyngitis, and dysphagia. The ratios of epiglottic width to third cervical vertebral body width (EW/C3W) of more than 0.5, of aryepiglottic width to third cervical vertebral body width (AEW/C3W) of more than 0.35, and of epiglottic width to epiglottic height (EW/EH) of 0.6 or more were all found to be 100% sensitive and specific in differentiating between adult patients with and without epiglottitis. In children, EW/C3W, AEW/C3W, and EW/EH ratios of more than 0.5, of more than 0.35, and of 0.6 or more, respectively, were found to be 100% sensitive in detecting epiglottitis with specificities of 87%, 96%, and 87% respectively. These preliminary results suggest that EW/C3W, EW/EH, and AEW/C3W ratios of more than 0.5, of 0.6 or more, and of more than 0.35, respectively, may be useful in the radiologic diagnosis of epiglottitis in patients of all ages.
