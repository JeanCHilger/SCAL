Spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality in children imaged with magnetic resonance imaging. This study aimed to compare children diagnosed with cervical spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) relative to whether there is evidence of cervical spinal cord abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).We conducted a planned subanalysis of a cohort of children younger than 16 years with blunt cervical spine injury presenting to Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network centers from January 2000 to December 2004 who underwent cervical MRI and did not have bony or ligamentous injury identified on neuroimaging. We defined SCIWORA with normal MRI finding as children with clinical evidence of cervical cord injury and a normal MRI finding and compared them with children with SCIWORA who had cervical cord signal changes on MRI (abnormal MRI finding).Of the children diagnosed with cervical spine injury, 55% (297 of 540) were imaged with MRI 69 had no bony or ligamentous injuries and were diagnosed with SCIWORA by clinical evaluationChildren diagnosed with SCIWORA but with normal MRI finding in our cohort presented differently and had substantially more favorable clinical outcomes than those with cervical cord abnormalities on MRI.Epidemiologic study, level III.
