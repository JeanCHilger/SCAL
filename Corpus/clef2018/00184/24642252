Prevalence of sternoclavicular joint calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition on computed tomography. We sought to determine the prevalence of sternoclavicular (SC) joint calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition and its association with age, osteoarthritis, and atlantoaxial CPPD crystal deposition. In 209 consecutive patients, computed tomographic examinations of the cervical spine were retrospectively reviewed. Overall prevalence of CPPD crystal deposition in the SC joint was 17.2% (36/209), which increased with age (P<.0001). There was also a significant association between SC CPPD and osteoarthritis (P=.024) as well as atlantoaxial joint CPPD crystal deposition (P=.006).
