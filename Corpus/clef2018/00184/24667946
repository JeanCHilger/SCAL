Not your typical torticollis: a case of atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation. A 9-year-old boy was pushed while carrying a heavy backpack. He had no fall or direct trauma to his neck. After a few hours from the incident, he presented with neck pain and torticollis. However, somewhat atypical for torticollis, he was not able to rotate his face to the neutral position. There were no neurological deficits. Concerned by his inability to rotate his neck, the clinician suggested CT of the upper cervical spine, which demonstrated rotary subluxation of the atlantoaxial junction. The patient was taken to the operating theatre. Reduction was performed under general anaesthesia. He did well and was back to school in the following days.
