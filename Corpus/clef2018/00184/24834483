Oblique lateral radiographs and bitewings estimation of organ doses in head and neck region with Monte Carlo calculations. When bitewing radiographs are not possible (e.g. patients with special needs), oblique lateral radiographs may offer an alternative. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of horizontal projection angulation, focus-to-skin distance, exposure time and age of the patient on the equivalent radiation dose of several organs in the head and neck region by means of personal computer X-ray Monte Carlo (PCXMC) calculations and to assess the dose obtained from conventional bitewing radiographs.PCXMC v. 2.0 software (STUK(Â®), Helsinki, Finland) was used to estimate the equivalent radiation doses and the total effective dose. Three exposure times, five age categories, two focus-to-skin distances and eight horizontal geometric angulations were assumed. The organs involved were the thyroid gland, oesophagus, salivary glands, bone marrow, oral mucosa, skull, cervical spine and skin. A similar calculation was also performed for bitewings taken with a rectangular collimator. Results and conclusion Bitewings taken with rectangular collimation decrease the radiation burden of the patient to 50%, compared with circular collimation. In the oblique lateral radiographs, focus-to-skin distance, patient's age and beam collimation had a significant impact on the equivalent doses measured in this study. Exposure time had a significant impact on the equivalent doses of the salivary glands, oral mucosa, skull and skin. Horizontal angulations had a significant impact on the equivalent doses of the thyroid gland, bone marrow, oral mucosa, skull and cervical spine. The total effective radiation dose was significantly influenced by all parameters investigated in this study.
