Importance of absence of CSF pulsation artifacts in the MR detection of significant myelographic block at 1.5 T. MR imaging was performed on 21 patients who had high-grade myelographic block due to various diseases in all spinal compartments (extradural, intradural/extramedullary, and intramedullary) and in all portions of the spinal canal (cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral). Loss of CSF pulsation artifacts due to significant compression of the spinal cord was demonstrated on non-motion-compensated T2-weighted examinations in each case. We believe that the absence of such artifacts on these sequences indicates significant spinal cord compression in patients without classic signs and symptoms of cord compression but with intraspinal disease identified on T1-weighted studies.
