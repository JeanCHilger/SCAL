Usefulness of dual-energy digital radiography in detecting atlas and axis. Cranial dual-energy digital radiography was applied to three patients. The anatomy of the atlas and axis was clearly recognized without utilizing the open-mouth view. We consider it a very effective technique when applied to the patient who experiences difficulty in opening the mouth, like severe traumatic or infantile patients. In addition, it is a useful examination for patients with suspected anomalies of cranio-vertebral junction.
