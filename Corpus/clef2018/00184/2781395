Gunshot wounds to the spine associated with a perforated viscus. The cases of 42 patients with low-velocity gunshot wounds to the spine with an associated perforated viscus were reviewed. All viscus perforations occurred prior to the spinal injury. There were a total of 51 perforations, including 14 of the colon, 15 of the small bowel, 15 of the stomach, five of the esophagus, and two of the pharynx. All patients had significant neurologic deficits, with 23 patients suffering a complete neurologic injury. Average clinical follow-up was 18 months (range: 4-64 months). Only three patients developed documented spinal or paraspinal infections. One case of acute meningitis occurred after an isolated stomach perforation, while two other patients developed psoas abscesses after colon injuries. The roles of initial antibiotic therapy and of early bullet removal were evaluated in regard to infection. An extended course of broad spectrum antibiotics combined with bedrest appeared to significantly reduce the risk of spinal or paraspinal infection as compared with a previous study. Early bullet removal did not appear to be a significant factor in the prevention of infection. Prospective studies are needed to accurately delineate the role of initial antibiotic therapy for the prevention of spinal infection in these injuries.
