Head posture and dentofacial asymmetries in surgically treated muscular torticollis patients. Muscular torticollis is a medically well-known condition that is usually diagnosed in early childhood and in which early surgical intervention is recommended to prevent the development of facial asymmetries. The purpose of this study is to examine head posture and possible dentofacial asymmetries in patients who have undergone surgical treatment for muscular torticollis in early childhood. Natural head position roentgenograms were taken in frontal projection, a clinical examination of oral status was performed, and dental casts were made. Marked craniofacial and dental asymmetries were observed, combined with a deviant head posture, in spite of surgical treatment for muscular torticollis earlier in childhood.
