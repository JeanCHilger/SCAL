Transoral-transpharyngeal approach to the anterior craniocervical junction. Ten-year experience with 72 patients. The anterior transoral-transpharyngeal operation to correct ventral irreducible compression of the cervicomedullary junction was utilized in 72 individuals. The patients' ages ranged from 6 to 82 years, and 29 were children. The pathology encountered was primary basilar invagination, rheumatoid irreducible cranial settling, secondary basilar invagination due to migration of odontoid fracture fragments, dystopic os odontoideum, granulation masses, clivus chordoma, osteoblastoma, and chondroma of the atlas. Fifteen patients had associated Chiari malformation with basilar invagination. Fifty-two patients required subsequent atlantoaxial or occipitocervical fusion. Neurological improvement was the rule. There were two deaths within 30 days of surgery: one from myocardial infarction 4 weeks after surgery and one from Gram-negative septicemia of urinary tract origin. There was one pharyngeal wound infection. The ventral transoral approach provides a safe, rapid, and effective means for decompression of the abnormal craniovertebral junction.
