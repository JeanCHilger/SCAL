Posterior cervical reconstruction with methyl methacrylate cement and wire: a clinical review. The charts and radiographs of 20 patients who were treated for traumatic cervical instability by the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Virginia by means of posterior reconstruction with methyl methacrylate cement and fixation wires were reviewed by the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Based primarily on radiographic criteria, it was found that posterior reconstruction failed to rigidly immobilize the underlying unstable motion segments in 11 patients. Four of these patients required additional surgery to correct postoperative instability. Based on this experience, cement and wire reconstructions are now recommended only when: 1) they can be limited to one cervical level 2) No. 18 fixation wire is used
