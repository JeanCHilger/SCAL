CT scan helps delineate cervical osteoid osteoma and atypical nidus. Computerized tomography proves to be particularly helpful in anatomically delineating an osteoid osteoma of the spine in an inaccessible area and in also identifying an atypical nidus. A case is presented of an 8-year-old boy with a one-year history of pain in the right shoulder and neck. Computerized tomography accurately delineated in anatomic detail the lesion along with an atypical nidus adjacent to the spinal canal, thus assuring total excision of both lesions. The patient regained normal neck and shoulder motion with no recurrence of pain.
