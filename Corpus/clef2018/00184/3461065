Retropharyngeal calcific tendinitis: report of five cases and review of the literature. Retropharyngeal calcific tendinitis is an inflammation of the longus colli muscle tendon, which is located on the anterior surface of the vertebral column extending from the atlas to the third thoracic vertebra. Five cases of acute retropharyngeal calcific tendinitis seen in the emergency department (ED) over a 15-month period are reported. In addition, a retrospective review of four cases diagnosed as retropharyngeal abscess and admitted to the hospital revealed that two of these cases actually represented retropharyngeal calcific tendinitis. A review of the literature and potential differential diagnoses are presented. For those primary care physicians who must evaluate patients with acute cervical pain, sore throat, or odynophagia, an x-ray study of the neck revealing retropharyngeal calcium deposition should raise the question of the diagnosis of acute retropharyngeal tendinitis. Clinical characteristics of this entity include a painful condition which is treatable and is often mistaken for retropharyngeal abscess, pharyngitis, or peritonsillar abscess. In our opinion, this condition may be more prevalent than the literature suggests.
