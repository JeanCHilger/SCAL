Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of spinal cord injured children and adolescents. In order to determine the indications and usefulness of MRI scanning in evaluating spinal cord trauma, MRIs on 43 subacute and chronic spinal cord injured children were compared with CT myelograms and other diagnostic tests. MRI scans were superior to CT myelograms in evaluating post-traumatic syrinx, disc pathology and the physiological status of the cord. CT myelogram remains an essential study before considering spinal cord decompression. The presence of internal fixation is not a contraindication to MRI scanning.
