Physeal injuries of the cervical spine. Four cases of cervical spine growth plate ("ring apophysis") injury are described. Two nonfatal injuries involved anterior displacement of a portion of the inferior physis and epiphyseal ossification center in the lower cervical spine. Neither injury was associated with neurological damage. Follow-up roentgenograms demonstrated healing, but with a spur-like prominence in one patient. A third patient sustained a fatal separation through the inferior end plate of C2. The fourth patient sustained a complete separation of C6 from C7. These injuries are correlated with pathologic specimens and normal developmental anatomy.
