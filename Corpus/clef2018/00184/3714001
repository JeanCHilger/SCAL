Management of bilateral locked facets of the cervical spine. A total of 28 cases of cervical spine dislocation with bilateral locking of facets treated between 1976 and 1984 were analyzed to determine whether treatment modality had any effect on outcome based on cord or root function. Motor vehicle accidents were responsible for 19 cases the most common levels of dislocation were C-5, C-6 and C-6, C-7, with 10 each. Twenty patients were admitted with complete myelopathies. Ten patients whose dislocations were successfully reduced with traction had no neurological changes, but 1 reduced elsewhere deteriorated from a C-5 to C-2 level. Eleven of these patients underwent posterior cervical fusions after delays of 1 to 17 days (mean = 6.3)
