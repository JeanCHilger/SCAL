Radiology of fracture-dislocation of the cervical spine during delivery. Four infants with fracture-dislocation of the cervical spine after traumatic delivery are described. In one patient with tetraparesis and complete dislocation of the cervical spine, transection of the cord at C6 was shown at autopsy. Two patients had fractures through the superior cartilaginous plates of the vertebral body with anterior subluxation of the spine. A fourth patient had a vertical fracture through the body of C5 with tracheal compression secondary to anterior dislocation of the spine. With conservative therapy, these three patients had good clinical recovery with healing and remodeling of the fractured vertebrae.
