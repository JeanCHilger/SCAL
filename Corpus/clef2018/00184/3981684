Aortic gunshot injury and paraplegia: preoperative definition with arteriography and computerized axial tomography. Computerized axial tomography provided the diagnosis for an evolving paraplegia in a patient with a gunshot wound of the descending thoracic aorta. Successful surgical management of the aortic injury and considerations regarding the paraplegia are presented. We do not advocate arteriography and computed tomography routinely in major vascular injuries however, in clinically stable patients with a high suspicion of associated injuries, use of both can be useful.
