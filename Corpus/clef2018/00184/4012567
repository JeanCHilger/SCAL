Stabilization of acrylic vertebral body replacement. A simple technique of internal vertebral body screw fixation for stabilization of acrylic vertebral body replacements is described. The screw fixation prevents subluxation and rostrocaudal dislocation of the acrylic prosthesis. A case report is presented of a patient who underwent replacement of the second cervical body and odontoid with an intraoperatively molded methylmethacrylate prosthesis with rapid neurological recovery and good stabilization.
