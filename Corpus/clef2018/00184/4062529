Heart rate response to facial immersion and apnea in quadriplegia. Profound bradycardia is a common complication in the early posttraumatic period following cervical spinal cord damage. It is thought to be due to temporary inactivity of the sympathetic nervous system after separation from supraspinal control, coupled with unopposed parasympathetic dominance because of vagus nerve sparing. Hypoxia, underventilation, and tracheal suctioning appear to intensify the bradycardia. This study examined the effect of vagal stimulation using facial immersion and apnea on heart rate in patients with quadriplegia. Ten patients with quadriplegia (eight males and two females, mean age 25, age range 16-37) and ten healthy controls (eight males and two females, mean age 25, age range 15-37) underwent facial immersion during ECG monitoring. The patients with quadriplegia were studied at a mean of 9.4 months after injury (range, 4-26 months) cord level of injury ranged from C5 to C8
