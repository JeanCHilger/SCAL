Cervical myelography and x-ray computed tomography in arm paralysis of traumatic origin. Results of cervical myelography by the lumbar approach were compared with those of CT scan imaging after subarachnoid metrizamide by the lumbar route, in 16 patients operated upon for post-traumatic cervical spine lesions. Examination in each patient included the last four cervical and first thoracic roots on the injured side, making a total of 80 roots. Lesions detected by myelography and CT scanning are described, comparison of semiologic data with gross findings at operation showing poorer diagnostic accuracy for myelography (86%) than for myelography and a CT scan combined (97%). Sensitivity of the former varied between 70 and 90%, depending on whether doubtful forms were classed as normal or pathologic, but was lower than that of the CT scan (96%). This also applied to specificity (90% as against 96%) and diagnostic accuracy (86% to 90% as against 97%). Combining myelography with a CT scan after subarachnoid contrast injection provides complementary very precise data allowing improved therapeutic results.
