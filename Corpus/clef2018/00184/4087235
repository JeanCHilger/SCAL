Posterior hernia of a calcified disk in children. Apropos of 2 cases. Posterior herniation of a calcified disk was detected in two children. A 10-year-old boy presented with cervicobrachial neuralgia at the C7 level secondary to herniation of a calcified C6-C7 disk treated by surgery. A 13-year-old boy was seen with a post-traumatic painful stiffness in the thoracic region posteriorly, without neurologic complication, secondary to a herniated calcified T4-T5 disk. Surgery was not performed and the course was favorable with regression of clinical signs and spontaneous disappearance of the herniated calcified fragment. A literature review showed reports of 21 identical lesions, full details being provided in 9 cases. Epidemiologic data, clinical manifestations, diagnostic means and management of these patients are discussed.
