Pentolinium for control of reflex hypertension in spinal cord injured patients. Ganglioplegia was produced by intravenous infusion of pentolinium tartrate 5 mg to control reflex hypertension in 29 patients with chronic spinal cord injuries undergoing 32 elective surgical procedures. The patient group with lesions above the first thoracic segment (T1) demonstrated significant but moderate intraoperative elevation of both systolic and diastolic pressure whether pentolinium was given prior to or during surgical stimulation. Patients with lesions below T1 had no significant pressure elevations with either mode of therapy. Pentolinium ganglioplegia can safely maintain blood pressure within reasonable limits in these patients some increase in dosage may be required in patients with lesions above T1.
