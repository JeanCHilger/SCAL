Diving-type injury of the cervical spine: contribution of computed tomography to management. We have utilized computed tomography (CT) in addition to conventional radiography for evaluation and as a guide to management of serious diving injuries to the cervical spine. This technique has proven to be invaluable in the initial assessment and further clinical management of this type of injury. A classification of these injuries and associated fractures is presented based on CT appearance. Representative cases are presented comparing standard radiography and CT.
