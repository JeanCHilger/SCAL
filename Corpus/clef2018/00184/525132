Diagnosis and treatment of birth injuries of the cervical portion of spine and spinal cord in newborn infants. Experience in the treatment of 200 newborns with birth spinal cervical trauma in the acute period (under 3 weeks of age) is generalized. Forty-nine infants died circulatory disorders and edema of the spinal cord were the prevalent morphological findings. The clinical manifestations were pareses of the upper extremities and, less frequently, truncal disorders. X-ray examination revealed spinal injury, epidural hematomas and edema of the spinal cord. Treatment included reduction of the dislocated vertebrae with subsequent immobilization of the cervical spine and rehabilitation therapy. Improvement and, sometimes, total normalization of the functions of the spinal cord were achieved.
