Fractures of the second cervical vertebra: Internal fixation by interlaminar wiring. Fractures of the 2nd cervical vertebra are frequently undetected on initial evaluation. Tomography may be necessary to delineate the fracture. This is a report of 20 patients treated by internal fixation using interlaminar wiring. There was no operative mortality. Follow-up studies, an average of 25 months after operation, demonstrated satisfactory results and no evidence of delayed neurological deficit.
