Football shoulder and neck injury: a study of the "stinger". Twenty football players with preliminary diagnosis of "stinger" were examined and treated. Of the 12 on whom EMGs were performed, all but one were proven to have C6 radiculopathy rather than lateral stretch of brachial plexus. Most frequent mode of injury was neck flexion during tackling by a linebacker. Athletes should not return to competition until abnormal neurologic signs disappear.
