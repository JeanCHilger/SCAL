Cervicomedullary junction tumor diagnosed by nuclear magnetic resonance scanning: case report. A neurofibroma of the cervical medullary region was accurately delineated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scanning. The tumor and its compression of the spinal cord were so well visualized that evaluation by myelography and postmyelographic computed tomography (CT) was unnecessary. NMR scanning should be considered as a replacement for myelography with CT in the initial evaluation of cervicomedullary spinal cord tumors.
