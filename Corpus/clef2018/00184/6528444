Changes in the cervical spine in congenital spastic torticollis. The authors have examined 19 children with congenital spastic torticollis. Roentgenography of the cervical part of the spine was made in all the patients before operative treatment and at different terms after surgery. The results of the examination suggest that torticollis is responsible for the abnormal function and development of the cervical part of the spine in children. It has been established that in cases with ineffective conservative treatment the early surgical correction must be recommended followed by continuous fixation of the patients' head in the right posture and permanent dispensary control.
