Cranio-vertebral junction and Morquio disease. Apropos of 6 cases. The authors study the anomalies of the cranio-vertebral junction in the Morquio disease. The first 6 cases reported, in addition to the usual vertebral anomalies, suffered from a junctionnal malformations that were operated by posterior decompression and occipito-vertebral arthrodesis. In these cases, they especially study: --the neurological repercussion in 5 cases that could only be evidenced by a very careful examination after a stress test --the simple roentgenographic examination, in forced position, and gaseous myelography proved on one band, that the instability, which is supposed to be responsible for the neurological symptoms, is actually inconstant (2 case out of 6).
