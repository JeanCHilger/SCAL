Spinal lesions following modified exercises in adolescent high performance gymnasts. 20 high performance gymnasts between 14 and 22 years of age had an anamnestical, clinical and radiological checkup on the spine in order to assess news training-methods. Radiologically only 3 gymnasts were found to be without any pathological manifestation. 7 cases of M. Scheuermann were located. The other athletes showed degenerative findings of vertebral columns especially in the thoracic-lumbar transition. These degenerative signs, and the fact tht the gymnasts had no spondylosis, are the result of new exercises, which avoid extreme bending load in the lowest segment of the lumbar region. Anamnestical and radiological findings do not correlate. A critical medical screening is necessary before and during high performance training.
