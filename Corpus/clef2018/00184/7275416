Anterior interbody fusion in fractures and fracture-dislocations of the spine. Twenty-five cases of unstable fractures and fracture-dislocations of the spine are reviewed. They were treated at the Catholic Medical College and Centre in a 3-year period, 1975 to 1978. 1. Eleven of the 25 patients were treated by anterior interbody fusion performed at 6 to 8 weeks from injury or initial surgery. 2. Eleven patients had neurological deficits, 3 with incomplete lesions and 8 with complete lesions. Open reduction and decompression laminectomies were performed on patients having neurological deficits prior to anterior interbody fusion. Two patients with incomplete paraplegia showed marked neurological recovery whilst one with complete paraplegia regained some sensation. 3. Solid clinical fusion was obtained in all but one patient within four months of interbody fusion. 4. Amongst the 18 patients with kyphosis at the time of admission 10 had a final improvement of their kyphosis ranging from 3 to 10 degrees (average 6 degrees). Three had no change and 5 demonstrated a mild increase of kyphosis (average 4 degrees). 5. Pain was relieved in 21 patients out of 25. The advantages of this technique include effective stabilization, prevention of late deformity and relatively early mobilization without internal fixation.
