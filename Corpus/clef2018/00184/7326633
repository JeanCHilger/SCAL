False aneurysms of the subclavian artery. The authors describe two cases of false aneurysm of the right subclavian artery. One was due to a penetrating cervical injury and the other to blunt thoracic trauma. Both patients were treated surgically. Early diagnosis by aortography and surgical treatment are important. The operation is difficult because of the cervicothoracic course of the subclavian artery. Because of this a wide approach should be made and reconstruction is mandatory.
