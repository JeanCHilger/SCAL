Craniospinal and cervicospinal malformations associated with maxillonasal dysostosis (Binder syndrome). Craniospinal and cervicospinal malformations were found in 15 (53.5%) of 28 cases of maxillonasal dysostosis (Binder syndrome) in which a complete radiographic analysis could be done. These anomalies have not been reported previously. Analysis of the anomalies suggested a common induction factor, or, at least, a simultaneity in the development of the maxillonasal and vertebral dysplasias that characterize Binder syndrome. The following procedures are recommended: (1) examination of the cranial and cervical spine in all subjects with symptoms of Binder syndrome, and (2) regular examination of patients with spinal malformations, so that any neurologic damage may be detected early.
