Clinical picture and diagnosis of craniovertebral anomalies. It has been found that anomalies of the craniovertebral region are characterized by polymorph degenerative changes in the bones. This regularity appeared to be especially typical for Arnold-Chiari's anomaly, the fact, that gives one ground to expand the scope of the notion and to specify some variants of that anomaly. Complicated anomalies manifest themselves in the form of three clinical syndromes, that is, the cerebellobulbar, the syringomyelitic and the pyramid ones. In cases of acute progressing of those syndromes surgical intervention is indicated, while in chronically developing syndromes restorative and rehabilitation treatment can be given.
