Spinal cord concussion in previously undiagnosed osteogenesis imperfecta. An 11-year-old boy was a victim of a motor vehicle accident. He initially presented with paraplegia and inability to detect pain below the fourth thoracic dermatome. Two hours later, he had full return of motor and sensory function. Thoracolumbar spine radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple compression fractures and marked osteopenia of the vertebrae. The patient's family history is significant for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), although the patient had not been previously diagnosed with this disorder. Although the patient had no prior fractures or any of the classic stigmata of OI except for short stature, plain radiographic and MRI findings in conjunction with his family history support the diagnosis of OI. A brief discussion of both OI and spinal cord concussion is presented.
