Spinal cord compression due to thoracic spinal chondroma. A study of 2 case and a review of the literature. We report two cases of thoracic spine chondroma in two girls aged 14 and 12 years. The lesion was revealed by signs of spinal cord compression and affected T1 and T7 respectively. Chondroma is a benign bone tumour, fairly frequent in the extremities but very rare in the spine. It accounts for 2.8% of benign bone tumours and 12% of all bone tumors. 3.6% to 4% of chondroma are located in the spine. Out of 51 cases reported in the literature 21 had been revealed by spinal cord compression, with an age range of 5 to 76 years. In all cases of spinal cord compression magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary as first-line examination, but CT scans are still useful in the diagnosis and post-operative follow-up of spinal chondroma because of the osteo-cartilaginous nature of these tumors. The purpose of this study was to report two new cases of spinal cord compression by thoracic spine chondroma and to review the literature.
