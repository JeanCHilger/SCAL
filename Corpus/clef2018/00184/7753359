Cervical epidural hematoma secondary to an extradural vascular malformation in an infant: case report. We present a report of a 22-month-old infant with a spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma arising from a purely epidural vascular malformation. Although often suspected as a cause of spontaneous epidural hemorrhage, vascular malformations have rarely been demonstrated. The important aspects of the presenting symptoms in this young age group are highlighted. We discuss the entity of spontaneous epidural hemorrhage and the characteristics that distinguish purely epidural from dural arteriovenous malformations.
