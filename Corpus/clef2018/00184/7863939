Acute spinal subdural hematoma: MR and CT findings with pathologic correlates. To determine the MR and CT findings that characterize acute spinal subdural hematoma (ASSH).The MR, CT, and clinical findings in three patients with surgically proved ASSH were reviewed and also correlated with the postmortem MR, CT, and cryomicrotome findings in three other patients, two with ASSH and one with an acute spinal epidural hematoma.Imaging findings in ASSH included: (a) hyperdense lesions on plain CT within the dural sac, distinct from the adjacent low-density epidural fat and silhouetted against the lower-density spinal cord and cauda equina, which it compressed (b) lack of direct continuity with the adjacent osseous structuresWhen MR and plain CT are obtained as complementary studies, they provide characteristic findings that allow the prompt diagnosis of ASSH.
