Autogenous bone grafts in cervical vertebrectomy and fusion practice for injuries. Among the patients with a cervical injury admitted to our clinic between 1980 and 1988, 18 cases underwent a ventral fusion operation (Cloward) and 8 of them needed additional vertebrectomy. The injury in all of these cases was due to falls and presented with major compression fractures. In each case the vertebral body was resected and replaced by a "T" shaped iliac bone graft. The graft was fixated by a screw or wire when necessary, than the patients were immobilized by a bed rest for 2 weeks duration. During the follow-up period, cervical alignment was found to be stable in all patients. The radiological characteristics of the lesions, intraoperative surgical modifications for specific aspects of the lesion, other technical availabilities and the results are discussed.
