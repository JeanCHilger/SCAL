Flexible cystoscopy during urodynamic evaluation of spinal cord-injured patients. Eighty-one consecutive flexible cystoscopic examinations were performed on 69 patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) at the time of their urodynamic study. The indications for cystoscopy included hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction, the presence of an intraurethral sphincter stent requiring evaluation, neurogenic vesical dysfunction requiring endourodynamic study (cystometrogram through the working port of the flexible cystoscope), or bladder calculi. Flexible cystoscopy was accomplished in all patients, whether lying supine or seated in a wheelchair (N = 16). Only 6 of 39 patients with previous episodes of autonomic dysreflexia became hypertensive during cystoscopy. When a urodynamic catheter could not be inserted, the flexible cystoscope was particularly useful in defining the urethral anatomy or obstruction and in performing endourodynamic evaluation. The only complication was the development of febrile urinary tract infection in four patients. The flexible cystoscope is a valuable tool in the urodynamic laboratory caring for patients with SCI and is effective for use in endourodynamics, especially when patient positioning or catheter placement is difficult. The procedure is well tolerated, causes minimal stimulation leading to the development of autonomic dysreflexia, and provides accurate cystometric data.
