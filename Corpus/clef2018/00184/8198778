A computer-aided walking rehabilitation robot. Even with recent techniques, a significant number of patients with multiple injuries cannot be mobilized at an early stage despite the fixation of all fractures. Conventional mobilization aids are not able to provide the prescribed weight bearing needed in fractures, especially those involving both the lower limbs. Robotics is a current technology aimed at improving the quality of medical care. To this end, Takatoshi Ide developed the mobility rehabilitation robot, the REHABOT. This apparatus facilitates rehabilitation by providing secure postural support and prescribed weight bearing during ambulation. The REHABOT has been used for early mobilization and gait training of severely disabled patients at different hospitals in Japan during the last 6 years. In most of the cases, this training has resulted in earlier improvement of ambulatory capability. In this paper we report the use of this device for early ambulation in two patients with multiple fractures involving the extremities and the spine. Early mobilization was achieved by initially reducing the weight bearing to 30% of body weight followed by a gradual increase governed by patient tolerance. The average length of training for these two patients was 18 days. The average total distance was 5.5 km and total walking duration was 4.5 h. After the completion of the training both patients were able to walk independently.
