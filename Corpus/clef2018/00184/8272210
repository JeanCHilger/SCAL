Operative spondylodesis in injuries of the lower cervical spine. In view of the high incidence of late instability during conservative treatment of cervical spine fractures, operative stabilization should be performed as soon as possible. Besides immediate decompression of the spinal cord, rapid mobilisation of the patient without external fixation is possible. We report on the results of operative treatment in 97 patients with injuries of the lower cervical spine. The indication for spondylodesis as well as the surgical methods and their complications are discussed.
