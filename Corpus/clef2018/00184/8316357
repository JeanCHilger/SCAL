Diagnostic evaluation of the cervical nystagmus in cervical torsion test. The aim of this work was comparative evaluation of the cervical nystagmus in cervical torsion test with the Nylen's positional nystagmus and their diagnostic value in correlation from anatomical state of cervical column. The authors examined 40 patients with degeneration of cervical spinal column and with normal radiograph of cervical spinal column. The obtained results showed that the cervical nystagmus in cervical torsion test was more frequent (47.5%) than the Nylen's positional nystagmus (37.5%). The cervical nystagmus in cervical torsion test was observed also in health subjects. The authors think that the above mentioned deviations can be caused by the discreet degeneration of cervical spinal column, unseizable in radiograph. The examinations showed that the cervical nystagmus in cervical torsion test could be used simultaneously with the Nylen's positional nystagmus in diagnostic of vertigo, first at all in patients with degeneration of cervical spinal column.
