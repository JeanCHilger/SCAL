Spinal injury in sport: epidemiologic considerations. Review of previous epidemiologic studies, involving both contact and noncontact sports at all levels of competition ranging from the high school level to the professional level, reveals that the overwhelming majority of sports injuries related to the spine are soft-tissue injuries and self-limiting. The spectrum of injury is related to the mechanism, the force involved, and the point of application of the force. The immediate consequence of a soft-tissue injury is decreased immobilization with result in deconditioning. Most athletes have a strong desire to compete both at the amateur and professional levels. The inability to compete can have both psychologic and emotional consequences. The professional athlete is potentially burdened with financial consequences as well. The mainstay of prevention and treatment is maintaining good strength and flexibility through conditioning. Injuries can occur at the level of the disc, resulting in disc herniation, disc degeneration, and ultimately developmental stenosis. The biochemistry and biomechanics of the disc are age related, and thus, the adolescent and older athlete may have different concerns with regards to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis after injury to the spine. Remember, not only injuries cause back pain in the athlete. Athletes, too, can have tumors, infection, rheumatologic disorders, and other nontraumatic etiologies of back pain. Rarely athletic injuries to the spine do result in significant neurologic compromise. These injuries have been brought to national attention with the tragic recent injuries of well-known professional football and hockey athletes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
