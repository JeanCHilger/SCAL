Pediatric trauma. Injured children require an organized, properly equipped, team approach to management. The emergency physician must be aware of the anatomic and physiologic differences that predispose the child to certain injuries. Aggressive airway and hemodynamic resuscitation are essential in the critically injured child. A network of pediatric trauma consultants should be identified in your region for early consultation and referral. Continued research and the ongoing epidemiologic studies from the National Pediatric Trauma Registry will improve our understanding and management of the injured child. It is essential for each of us to become a strong injury prevention advocate in our own community.
