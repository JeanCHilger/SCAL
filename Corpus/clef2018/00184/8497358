Pregnancy and delivery in women with a traumatic spinal cord injury in Sweden, 1980-1991. To evaluate the incidence of delivery in women after a traumatic spinal cord injury and to describe pregnancy outcome in this group of patients.Between 1980-1991, 29 women with a traumatic spinal cord injury experienced 49 pregnancies and gave birth to 52 children in Sweden. A retrospective chart review of the antepartum, intrapartum, and perinatal records of these patients was performed. In addition, all patients participated in a telephone interview held by one of the authors. Of the 29 women, 12 had lesions above T5 and 17 had lesions at T5 or below.Antenatal complications occurred frequently in this group. Nine of 12 patients with lesions above T5 had symptoms of autonomic hyperreflexia during pregnancy and/or delivery. Only in a minority of the women was the problem recognized by the medical professionals. Nine of the infants (19%) were born preterm and two were small for gestational age. The perinatal mortality rate was two of 52 (3.8%) and occurred in two cases of abruptio placentae. Few of the patients were allowed to deliver vaginally. The cesarean delivery rate for women with lesions above T5 was 47% and for women with lesions below that level, 26%.The overall prognosis for these women was favorable. However, women with higher spinal cord lesions would probably benefit from referral to centers with a particular interest and expertise in the management of their problems.
