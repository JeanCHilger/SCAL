The long term outcome in 149 patients with spinal cord injury. A longitudinal follow-up study of 149 spinal cord injured patients is presented. Ninety two patients have been visited and interviewed at home 7-10 years after injury (28% died during the follow-up). Disability was assessed using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and was correlated with the neurological level, impairment and spasticity. The handicap was assessed using the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI). Multivariate analysis showed a correlation with age, neurological impairment, sexual impairment, living conditions and social life. There was a high correlation with depression and the Functional Independence Measure. The early neurological examination correlated with their long term disability but not with their handicap.
