Use of ultrasonography methods in the diagnosis of neurogenic paraosteoarthropathy in spinal cord injury. To assess the role of the ultrasonic imaging evaluation of articular lesions suspected to be the initial presentation of heterotopic ossifications (HO), 59 consecutive injured patients were studied. 32 out of 59 patients showed clinical signs of local inflammation in one of the articular sites of the upper or lower limbs, sonographic scans proved to be diagnostic of HO in 7 out of those 32 patients before their radiographic findings. Serial sonographic examinations were performed utilizing a 7.5 MegaHertz transducer probe for 2 months. The imaging abnormalities were correlated with biochemical levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, modifications of radiographic features and bone 99nTC scintigraphy. Scintigraphy revealed to have a high sensitivity but a low specificity for the diagnosis of HO. Also the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase were not a sensitive indicator of early HO in our group of patients. Moreover serial sonographic scans confidently excluded the HO in the 25 patients with no initial signs of the disease without any false negative results. Thus, early sonographic assessment of patients, with spinal cord injury in which local signs of inflammation suggest initial HO formation, revealed to be superior to the other utilized technique for the diagnosis of HO and may be considered a valuable alternative in particular to evaluate the evolutive pattern of this disease.
