Timing of surgical decompression and fixation of acute spinal fractures. A retrospective evaluation of 138 patients requiring operative decompression, reduction and fixation of spinal injuries between January 1986 and April 1989 was conducted. The variables of timing and method of operative intervention, level and classification of fracture, associated injuries, injury severity score (ISS), associated neurologic deficits, length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and projected costs were analyzed for correlation with postoperative complications (pulmonary, skin, urinary, other). Four subgroups were identified: group IA patients underwent surgery within 72 h of injury and had an ISS of < 18 group IB patients underwent surgery after 72 h and had an ISS of < 18
