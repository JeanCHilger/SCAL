Thoracolumbar fractures without neurosurgical involvement: surgical or conservative treatment? The decision whether to treat amyelic thoracolumbar fractures conservatively or by surgical approach depends mainly on radiographic and clinical evaluation of their potential stability. An angle of kyphosis of 20 degrees or more evaluated using the sagittal index (s.i.) described by Farcy et al. in 1990, may be a valid indication for invasine treatment using pedicular systems for correction and stabilization on the other hand, conservative treatment may be adequate for ensuring satisfactory results in fractures with an angle of less than 20 degrees, which are less likely to become unstable in clinically negative patients. This study confronts the immediate and long-term radiographic and clinical results in 2 groups of patients treated for amyelic thoracolumbar fractures, one treated conservatively, the other surgically
