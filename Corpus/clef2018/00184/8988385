Ewing's tumor of the spine: report on seven cases including one with a 10-year follow-up. This study analyzed the cases of seven patients who completed the Treatment Protocol of the University Clinic of Navarre for Ewing's tumor of the spine between 1982 and 1993. The surgical procedures aimed at gaining local control and recovering the neurological deficit are discussed. Poor results in the survival rate can be expected, as shown by the clinical study. Only two patients are alive, including one who is free of disease more than 10 years after surgery.
