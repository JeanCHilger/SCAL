Degenerative-dystrophic process in the cranio-vertebral area, its clinical and social significance. A clinico-x-ray study of the cranio-vertebral area permitted to define the most frequently encounted forms of degenerative-dystrophic processes in this region. Some in an increased load. Others (depending upon the localization and expressiveness of the process) create conditions for development of neurological disturbances accompained not only by a temporary loss of working capacity, but by long-term incapacity, even invalidity, the severity of which depends upon the expressiveness of neurological disorders.
