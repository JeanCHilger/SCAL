Percutaneous embolization therapy in severe cervicofacial hemorrhages. To analyse the use of transcatheter embolisation.We report on 43 patients treated by transcatheter embolisation for head and neck haemorrhage from 1987 to 1995. There were 13 patients with idiopathic intractable epistaxis, 6 with iatrogenic and three with traumatic bleeding, 7 patients with bleeding from vascular malformations, 12 patients with haemorrhage from tumours, one ruptured aneurysm of the inferior thyroid artery and one patient bleeding from a retrolingual dystrophic goitre.In 11/13 patients with idiopathic epistaxis, this could be stopped. In 8/9 of the traumatic and iatrogenic bleedings the haemorrhage was treated by embolisation alone. In two cases additional elective surgical interventions were necessary. In 6/7 patients with vascular malformations embolisation resulted in long-lasting periods free from bleeding. Palliative embolisation in bleeding tumours resulted in haemostasis in 10/12 patients. Bleeding was definitely stopped in a patient with aneurysm of the inferior thyroidal artery as well as in a patient with bleeding from a dystrophic goitre. We observed a total of three complications, two transitory neurological disturbances and one permanent amaurosis.Transcatheter embolisation is an effective tool in the treatment of life-threatening head and neck bleedings.
