Maturational descent of the epiglottis. Otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists have described a maturational descent of the epiglottis that occurs in infancy and childhood.To investigate the changing level of the epiglottis to confirm and characterize this phenomenon more completely.A survey of 500 images with 338 images selected for the study.A tertiary care facility.Asymptomatic children aged 1 day to 18 years.The position of the tip of the epiglottis was correlated with the cervical vertebral level.Data indicate that maturational descent of the epiglottis starts in infancy and continues into adolescence. These results are statistically significant (P < .01).Maturational descent of the epiglottis occurs in a predictable pattern. Understanding this phenomenon may facilitate laryngoscopic, as well as clinical and radiologic, evaluation of the airway in children.
