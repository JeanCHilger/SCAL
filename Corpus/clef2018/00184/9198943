Abnormality as differential diagnosis in atlas fracture. In some patients, suspected fractures of the cranial part of the cervical spine are difficult to diagnose properly without the use of computed tomography or MT. In addition to imaging and positioning problems, the possibility of anomalies of the atlas vertebra may complicate the diagnostic considerations. Proper knowledge of such anomalies may facilitate the diagnostic procedures. The diagnostic problems are discussed, and are illustrated through two patients recently examined in our department.
