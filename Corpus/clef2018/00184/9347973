Upper cervical spine fusion in the pediatric population. The outcomes of 25 pediatric patients who underwent upper cervical or occipitocervical fusion at the authors' institution since 1983 were reviewed. At a mean age of 9 years, the patients presented with spinal instability that was associated with os odontoideum in 11 cases, rotatory subluxation in five cases, odontoid fracture in two cases, atlantooccipital dislocation in two cases, and congenital atlantoaxial instability in five patients, four of whom had Down's syndrome (trisomy 21). Ten children had abnormal findings on neurological examination preoperatively however, nine experienced improvement or resolution of deficits as of their latest follow-up evaluation (mean 17 months). Fusion was achieved with the first operation in 21 of 25 patients
