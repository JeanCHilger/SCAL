Roentgenological study of the sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal canal in normal adult Japanese. The sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal canal on roentgenograms in normal adult Japanese aged 15 years or over, 505 males and 492 females, was investigated to define the normal distribution and lower limit. Lateral roentgenograms of cervical spinal canals were taken at a constant focus-film distance of 1.5 m. The mean +/- SD magnification coefficient was 1.17 +/- 0.02. The mean +/- SD sagittal diameters of the cervical spinal canals at each vertebral level were: C-1, 21.0 +/- 2.2 mm C-2, 18.0 +/- 1.7 mm
