Spinal epidural vascular malformation presenting in association with a spontaneously resolved acute epidural hematoma. Case report. A 16-year-old boy developed acute neck pain and severe quadriparesis after mild rotatory movement of his neck. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cervical epidural hematoma that resolved spontaneously within a few days. Vertebral angiography demonstrated a small vascular malformation in the upper cervical epidural space. The vascular mass on the dural surface was totally resected and confirmed to be an arteriovenous malformation. This case represents the importance of including routine angiography in designing therapeutic strategy for cases of spinal epidural hematoma with spontaneous resolution.
