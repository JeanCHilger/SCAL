Cervical spine abnormalities and instability with myelopathy in warfarin-related chondrodysplasia: 17-year follow-up. A patient with warfarin embryopathy developed progressive cervical spinal myelopathy owing to bony cervical spinal damage. While there are several descriptions of warfarin embryopathy, the long-term complication of cervical spinal instability has not been reported. This cervical instability may, as in our patient, cause severe neurological dysfunction or even sudden death therefore, it is important that pediatric radiologists should be alert to this condition.
