An alternative dorsal fusion technique after transoral dens resection in basilar impression with atlas assimilation. Current therapy of basilar impression includes transoral dens resection. The essential disadvantage of this procedure is the instability of C1/C2 due to loss of the transverse ligament. We describe two patients in whom this instability was treated by modified screwing. Using MAGERL-screws between C0-C2 an interposition of an iliac graft between the occiput and the arc of C2 was made. Neurological symptoms improved in both patients postoperatively. In both cases stable fusion C0/C2 was achieved with an additional treatment with a HALO-fixateur for eight weeks. In our opinion the combined transoral/dorsal procedure is most suitable and efficient in treatment of basilar impressions. By this approach both, decompression of the myelon as well as stable fusion C0/C2, is achieved.
