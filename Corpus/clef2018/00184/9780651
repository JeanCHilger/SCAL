Primitive neuroectodermal tumor in the spinal epidural space--case report. A 4-year-old boy presented with a rare case of an epidural tumor causing compression of the thoracic spinal cord manifesting as rapid worsening of gait disturbance. The tumor was grossly totally resected, and radiotherapy and chemotherapy were subsequently administered. The histological diagnosis was primitive neuroectodermal tumor. He has been free of recurrence for more than 6 years. Early tumor resection followed by chemotherapy and irradiation is recommended for patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumor and unstable symptoms.
