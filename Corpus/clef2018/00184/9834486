Pain quantification after whiplash trauma using computer-interactive pressure-pain measurement. In patients with an acute cervicocephalic pain syndrome following whiplash injury (n = 12), pressure-pain scores for the splenius and the trapezius muscles on both sides, for the fingers on both sides and for the skull were recorded and compared to a control group. A computer-aided pain measurement was applied, which is presented as an improvement of pressure algesimetry. During constant application of pressure stimuli, the patient rated the increasing pain on a visual analogue scale, resulting in a curve of pain intensity against time. Slope and integral of the curve proved to be the most reliable parameters. After whiplash injury, significantly increased pain scores were found for the splenius muscle on both sides, for the left trapezius muscle and for the left finger whereas there was only a tendency of increased pain at the other stimulation sites. The presented method allows quantification of the cervical syndrome with neck and shoulder muscle sprain caused by whiplash injury. This objective and rater-independent method is of great value for diagnostic, therapeutic and medico-legal purposes in the assessment of the disease course and in clinical therapy trials.
