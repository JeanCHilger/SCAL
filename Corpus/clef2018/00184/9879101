Inflammatory disorders of the cervical spine. The most common inflammatory disorders affecting the cervical spine include adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, and psoriatic arthritis. These disorders are characterized by typical deformities and instabilities of the cervical spine that result from the destruction caused by synovitis in bony and ligamentous structures in the neck. The treatment of these inflammatory lesions differs from the treatment of similar lesions found in the posttraumatic or degenerative spine. This article attempts to outline the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and natural history of these conditions. Various radiographic parameters for evaluating disease progression have been used over the years, and their usefulness is reviewed in the context of recent studies better defining the radiographic natural history of these lesions. An algorithm for the use of the various imaging methods including magnetic resonance scanning is provided, and recent progress in delineating the proper timing of surgical intervention and the predictors of neurologic recovery is presented. The current surgical procedures available to treat these conditions are discussed with emphasis on distinguishing those cases in which stabilization alone is required from those in which a decompression procedure is also necessary.
