Fractures of the odontoid process: a report of 15 cases in children younger than 6 years. Fractures of the odontoid process are rare in children. We retrospectively reviewed 15 cases in children younger than 6 years, with an average follow-up of 4 years and 3 months. Eight of these patients had neurologic involvement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes were seen in the spinal cord at the cervicothoracic junction in six. This neurologic injury was thought to be due to the major anterior displacement of the upper spine, causing spinal cord stretch at the spinal apex of the cervical and thoracic spine. Eight patients secured in forward-facing car seats were injured as the result of motor vehicle accident. Conservatively treated fractures fused without problem. By contrast, the three cases operated on as the initial management of the fracture had complications postoperatively.
