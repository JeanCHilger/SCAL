Nonfatal cervical spine injuries in interscholastic football. The incidence of nonfatal neck injuries in high school football was determined by performing preseason examinations in 104 active high school players and 75 college freshman candidates. Coaches of all 430 Iowa high schools were asked to recall the number of players experiencing significant neck pain during the season. A detailed questionnaire for each injury was also completed by a sample population of 60 coaches. The incidence of roentgenographic evidence of neck injuries was as high as 32% and was related to years of experience. Injury was most likely to occur to a linebacker or a defensive halfback when they tackled the ball carrier. In the preseason examination, half the players who volunteered a history of significant neck pain had abnormal x-ray films.
