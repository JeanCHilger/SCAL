Inflammatory subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint. A case of atlantoaxial subluxation accompanying pharyngitis is reported in a 4-year-old child. Diagnosis was made by examination and roentgenograms of the lateral cervical spine. Treatment consisted of halter traction and bracing. The patient responded well to treatment and is normal in all respects one year later. Atlantoaxial subluxation should be considered when treating pharyngitis, especially if the patient presents with torticollis.
