Too many pediatric trampoline injuries. Recent reports note a dramatic increase in the number of pediatric trampoline injuries (PTI) during the past several years. In 1996, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that 83 000 patients received treatment for trampoline injuries in US hospital emergency departments (EDs), and that approximately 75% of these patients were <15 years of age. We sought to review our experience with PTI since our previous report (Pediatrics 199289:849), and to determine if the American Academy of Pediatrics' current (Pediatrics 1981Retrospective medical record review of all PTI patients presenting to the pediatric ED from November 1990 through November 1997.A total of 727 PTI patients were included medical records were unavailable for 3 patients. The annual number of PTI nearly tripled during the study period, from 51 in 1991 to a peak of 148 in 1996. PTI patients were 53% female, with a median age of 7 yearsPTI are dramatically increasing in number, and result in considerable childhood morbidity. Most PTI occur on privately owned trampolines. Few, if any, safety recommendations for the trampoline are followed. We support recommendations for a ban on the recreational, school, and competitive pediatric use of trampolines.
