Devic's optic neuromyelitis: analysis of 7 cases. Devic's optic neuromyelitis is an unusual condition characterized by the association of unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis and myelitis, both of which are relapsing. Prognosis is usually poor, both for the optic nerve and for the spinal medulla which becomes cavitated. This leads to severe handicap and deterioration in quality of life, except in cases presenting as children.We studied seven cases of this condition and describe their clinical and neuroimaging features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), evaluation, complications, prognosis and treatment. This data was compared with that in the literature.1. It is an unusual condition--only 7 cases have been seen at our centre--making up approximately 0.1% of the inflammatory pathology of the spinal cord seen. 2. During the first few hours or days the clinical and radiological findings may not correspond. There may be marked deterioration of CNS function but with normal neuroimaging findings. This may lead to serious problems in diagnosis, which can usually be resolved by repeating the investigation. 3. Differential diagnosis should be made with intramedullary tumors when on neuroimaging there is increased spinal cord diameter with uptake of contrast, and psychiatric disorders when this is normal. 4. The condition usually deteriorates leading to severe disability, since loss of visual acuity is added to the severe spinal cord lesion. 5. Diagnosis should be made by application of the criteria of clinical evolution, imaging and biochemistry defined in the literature, although firm diagnosis can only be made on anatomopathological studies, usually at autopsy.
