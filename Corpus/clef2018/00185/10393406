Carotid and vertebral artery injury following severe head or cervical spine trauma. In order to determine the frequency of neck vessel injuries, Doppler investigations were performed in 60 patients following either severe head injury (n = 29), cervical spine injury (n = 26), or combined head and cervical spine injury (n = 5). The majority of patients were referred to our hospital for early rehabilitation before admission Doppler investigations had been performed in only 2 patients. Clinically, 3 patients sustained severe cerebral ischemia due to neck vessel trauma: 1 patient with left-sided ICA dissection after head trauma revealed Doppler abnormalities only in the early phase of the disease
