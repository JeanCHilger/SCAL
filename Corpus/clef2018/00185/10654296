Spinal lipoma in children: analysis of magnetic resonance image for upward displacement of medullary-conus on 44 consecutive surgical cases. Medullary conus-untethering operation was conducted on 52 infants with spinal lipoma. Magnetic resonance (MR) image was used in order to evaluate the untethering results in 44 out of these 52 patients who could be followed-up after Osaka Medical Center & Research Institute for Maternal & Child Health was opened. Talking into account the changes in vertebral body during the growth period of infants, the authors studied the upward displacement of the conus-lipoma interface by four fractional MR sagittal image, using the vertebral body-intervertebral disc space as the baseline. Upward displacement was confirmed in 27 of 44 (61.4%). The mean, median and trimmed mean of upward displacement were 1.78 +/- 0.80, 2.0, 1.70 fractions, respectively. Sixteen (59.3%) were caudal type, 10 (37.0%) were transitional type and 1 (3.7%) was dorsal type. By type of spinal lipoma, upward displacement was observed in 16 of 23 caudal type patients (69.6%), 10 of 16 transitional type patients (62.5%) and 1 of 5 dorsal type patients (20%). While the rate of upward displacement was almost equal between the caudal and transitional type, that of dorsal type was lower. However, statistical analysis for the difference in population percentage of the three groups showed that significant difference existed only in the caudal type group.
