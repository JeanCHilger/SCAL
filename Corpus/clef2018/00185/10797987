Pott's spinal cord compression in the child. Spinal tuberculosis is the first etiology of spinal cord compression in our areas. We are studying the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of Pott's disease. We have collected all children aged from 0 to 15 years admitted for Pott's disease in department of Neurology in CHU Fann SenegaIL from January 1st 1983 to December 31st 1997 spinal tuberculosis. The diagnosis was both clinical and paraclinical. 27 children aged to 2-15 years were hospitalized for Pott's disease. The sex-ratio was equal to 2 in favour of boys. 77.77% of patients were consulted more than a month after the outbreak of the paraplegia. The notion of tuberculous contagion was found in 25.92% of the cases. The main clinical signs were paralysis of the limbs, sensory symptoms and bladder sphincter dysfunction. In 96.29% anomaly of disc and vertebra were recorded, more often affecting two vertebrae. The myelography, performed in 13 patients objectivized an epidural stop in 92.30% of the cases. There was a favorable evolution in 92% of patients under antituberculous chemotherapy. Spinal tuberculosis is an affection cheating all ages and it remains the first etiology of spinal cord compression in our areas.
