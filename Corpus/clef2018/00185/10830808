Comparative study between children with and without cleft lip and cleft palate, part 1: cephalometric analysis. This study was conducted to compare craniofacial relationships, position, and curvature of the cervical spine between children with cleft lip and cleft palate who had been operated on and children without clefts.This study was performed in 28 children with mixed dentition. They were divided into two groups. The study group included 14 children with unilateral operated cleft lip and cleft palate, ranging in age from 6 to 12 years, who clinically presented with a short upper lip, abnormal lip seal, and inhibition of sagittal development of the midface that was radiographically assessed. The control group included 14 children without clefts, ranging in age from 8 to 11 years. All of them had normal lip seal, nasal breathing, and a clinically normal body posture.A lateral craniocervical radiograph in a self-balanced natural head position in an erect posture, and without using a head holder, was taken for each child of both groups, with the mandible in maximum intercuspation and lips in habitual posture. The true vertical was marked on all the films. Specific angular and linear dimensions were used to assess the craniocervical relationships, as were the position of the cervical spine, its curvature, or both.The study group presented a significant increase in the extension of the head on the neck, forward position of the cervical spine, and a decrease in the curvature of the cervical spine in comparison with the children without clefts. These results are more relevant considering that the study group also presented higher significant values of lower facial height than children without clefts.
