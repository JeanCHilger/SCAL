A viable residual spinal hydatid cyst cured with albendazole. Case report. Spinal hydatid disease is a rare entity that frequently yields to severe, acute-onset neurological deficits. Although the gold standard treatment is total surgical removal of the cysts without inducing any spillage, it may not be possible to perform this in patients with multiple and fragile cysts. In such cases, the neural structures should be adequately decompressed and albendazole should be administered promptly. The authors describe the case of a 13-year-old girl who was admitted with a history of back pain and acute-onset lower-extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated severe spinal cord compression caused by multiple cysts involving T-4 and the mediastinum. The patient underwent surgery, and the cysts were removed, except for one cyst that was hardly exposed. Following histopathological confirmation of spinal hydatid disease, she was treated with albendazole for 1 year. One year postoperatively, the residual cyst had gradually shrunk and had almost disappeared. Although a single case is not sufficiently promising, we believe that administration of albendazole is efficient to prevent recurrences in cases in which it is not possible to obtain total removal of the cysts without inducing spillage.
