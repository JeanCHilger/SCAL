Cervical spine clearance and neck extension during percutaneous tracheostomy in trauma patients. The lack of cervical spine clearance and inability to extend the neck are assumed to be relative contraindications for percutaneous tracheostomy.To determine the necessity of cervical spine clearance and neck extension in trauma patients receiving percutaneous tracheostomy.Prospective analysis of case series from August 1, 1995 to August 31, 1998.A university-based Level I trauma center.A total of 88 consecutive trauma patients receiving percutaneous tracheostomy. Patients were divided into two groups based on the radiographic or clinical status of their cervical spine: cleared and noncleared.The overall success and complication rate were 99% (87/88) and 11% (10/88), respectively. There were no procedure-related deaths. The cleared group consisted of 60 patients three patients in this group who had "bull" or "thick" necks did not have full neck extension during percutaneous tracheostomy. The noncleared group consisted of 28 patients, 13 of which had known cervical spine fracturesPercutaneous tracheostomy can be safely performed in trauma patients without cervical spine clearance and neck extension, including patients with stabilized cervical spine or spinal cord injury.
