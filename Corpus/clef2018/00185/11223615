Endovascular carotid occlusion: a retrospective study of complications in 33 cases. Thirty three patients (16 men, 17 women), mean age 45 years underwent an intravascular carotid balloon occlusion for intracavernous aneurysms, carotid-cavernous fistulas or cervical carotid injuries by Fogarty balloons (5 patients before 1982) or detachable balloons (28 patients). Transient balloon test occlusion consisted in a clinical examination, an angiographic study for 32 patients with an electroencephalogram for 16 patients.Early complications occurred for four patients by veineous rupture (1 patient) or ischemic injury (3 patients). Late complications occurred for two patients by ischemic injuries, one asymptomatic.These results are similar to the literature's results and the transient test occlusion consisting in clinical examination, angiographic study and EEG seems to be reliable compared to cerebral blood flow determination.Even if its indications have decreased because of technic improvements permitting carotid flow preservation, carotid endovascular balloon occlusion stays a reliable, cheap technic in carotid injuries' treatment.
