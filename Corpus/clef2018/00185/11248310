Traumatic occipitoatlantal dislocation. Traumatic occipitoatlantal dislocation (OAD) is a severe ligamentous injury resulting in instantaneous death or severe neurological deficit. However, survivors of OAD, both short and long term, have been increasingly reported this may be because of improved prehospital care, more rapid transportation, a high index of suspicion, and new radiological techniques.The medical records and film of three patients who had traumatic OAD were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnosis was made by lateral cervical spine radiography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment consisted of early respiratory support and subsequent posterior surgical fusion.The three survivors of traumatic OAD represent 3.1% of all cervical spine injuries in our service. Two were children and the other was a 64-year-old man, all of whom suffered from severe neurological deficits. Lateral cervical spine radiographs led to the diagnosis of OAD. Two were longitudinal, and one was anterior. Two patients died within 2 weeks after injury. The remaining patient, who had anterior OAD, survived longer, which allowed posterior fusion with a U-shape Steinman pin and wiring to be performed. However, she died 5 months after injury because of septicemia.Early recognition and treatment may improve the outcome of this injury. Treatment consists of early respiratory support and subsequent surgical fusion.
