Routine cervical spine radiography for trauma victims: Does everybody need it? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the indication for routine cervical spine radiography in trauma patients.Prospective analysis of radiologic and clinical findings was performed during a 5-year period. Patients suitable for a clinical decision rule were reviewed separately.Of the 1,757 consecutive patients included in the study, 38 were diagnosed with a cervical spine injury. Of the 599 patients suitable for the clinical decision rule, 62 had midline cervical tenderness, including 2 with cervical spine injury. No additional cervical spine injuries were found during follow-up.It is within good practice, and it is also cost-effective, to obtain a cervical spine radiograph only on clinical parameters in trauma patients with no apparent bodily trauma and optimal parameters. With this clinical decision rule, 30.6% of all cervical spine series were redundant, and no (occult) spinal fractures would have been undetected.
