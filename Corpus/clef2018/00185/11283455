Vertebral osteoblastoma and scoliosis. Two cases report. We report two cases of spinal osteoblastoma in two boys aged 16 and 19 years. The lesion was disclosed by scoliosis with signs of thoracic and lumbar neurological compression. The diagnosis was provided by the CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging and was confirmed by the histology study of the surgical specimen. Involvement of the vertebral column has been estimated to range from 30 to 40% for these rare tumors that account for less than 1% of all bone tumors. Localization on the convex aspect of scoliosis is rare. CT-scan provides an analysis of the tumor components and clearly demonstrates intraspinal extension. MRI is superior in visualizing neurological compression. In our experience, function outcome has been favorable after surgical decompression.
