Facial nerve paralysis and paraplegia as presenting symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia. Granulocytic sarcoma is an extramedullary tumor associated with acute or chronic leukemias or myeloproliferative disorders. Rarely, the tumor may be seen before the diagnosis of leukemia. Symptomatic facial nerve paralysis and spinal cord invasion by granulocytic sarcomas are also relatively uncommon. We present here a 17-year-old-female patient who had facial nerve paralysis and paraplegia due to granulocytic sarcoma as the presenting symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia.
