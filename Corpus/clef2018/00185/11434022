Medullary extradural hematoma revealing a coarctation of the aorta. The authors report a spontaneous, unusual complication of coarctation of the aorta. An 11 year old child was admitted for investigation of chest pain. Cardiovascular examination revealed typical clinical signs of coarctation of the aorta. Neurological examination found neck stiffness without headache or deficit. The presumptive diagnosis of dissection of the aorta was infirmed by echocardiography and MRI. The latter investigation, with views of the spinal cord, revealed a compressive medullary extradural haematoma. Antihypertensive therapy and corticosteroids with strict bed rest resulted in complete regression of the haematoma and the coarctation was operated 6 months later. Medullary complications of coarctation of the aorta are usually postoperative. Spontaneous complications are exceedingly rare but very serious: medullary compression by the dilated anterior spinal artery or rupture of an aneurysmal collateral vessel. In this case, magnetic resonance imaging led to diagnosis and effective early treatment of this complication before the patient developed a neurological deficit and the coarctation was treated surgically thereafter.
