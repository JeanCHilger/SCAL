Factors predictive of subsequent deterioration in rheumatoid cervical myelopathy. To identify the features of rheumatoid cervical spine disease associated with deterioration resulting in the need for surgical intervention or death.Patients with rheumatoid cervical myelopathy who underwent cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 1991 and 1996 were identified. Patients requiring immediate surgical intervention were excluded. The remainder were divided into two groups. Deterioration group: patients requiring surgical intervention during the follow-up period and deaths resulting from cervical myelopathy. Conservative group: all other patients. Relevant clinical features and radiology reports were extracted retrospectively from the casesheet.The deterioration group comprised 11 patients (12%), median time to deterioration 15 months (range 4-84 months). The conservative group included 82 patients. Initial clinical features did not differ significantly between the two groups. Sixty per cent of those patients with compression or impingement at the atlanto-axial level on first MRI deteriorated over a median of 12 months (range 4-36 months).Deterioration is likely if there is evidence of cord compromise at the atlanto-axial level on MRI regardless of initial clinical and plain X-ray features.
