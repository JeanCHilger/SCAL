Clinical and radiographic manifestations of tuberculous spondylitis in adults. Data on 348 adult patients with tuberculous spondylitis treated in 1994-1999 are analyzed. The radiation manifestations of spondylitis first occurring in maturity, which amount to 82.3% in the clinical setting were studied in 112 patients. In 50% of cases, spondylitis was a manifestation of multiorgan tuberculosis. The proportion of those with onset in youth increased (27.9). Isolated lesions of the corpus vertebrae were more frequently detected. The processes involving 2 vertebrae were predominant (61.2%), but complicated by foci at new levels. There was a drastic increase in the proportion of disseminated and multi-levelled spondylitis involving 3-9 vertebrae (36.9%). The exudative component of the inflammation was much pronounced, abscesses were extensive in all forms of spondylitis. Spinal cord deficit was noted in 68% of cases of thoracic and cervical spondylitis. MRI should be used for early diagnosis and determination of the extent of a process.
