Age-specific time course of growth of cervical vertebrae and its potential for use in the evaluation of jaw development. A total of 370 lateral roentgenograms of the cervical part of the spine of children and adolescents of both sexes aged 6-18 years are analyzed. Time course of changes in the vertebrae is described on the basis of statistical data processing. Classification of stages in formation of vertebral apophyses is created. The authors prove impossibility of using cervical vertebrae for quantitative evaluation of the growth potential. A method for qualitative rapid diagnosis of biological age is proposed.
