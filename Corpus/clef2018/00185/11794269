Operative treatment of progressive deformity in spinal tuberculosis. We report on 14 patients with tuberculosis of the spine treated by operation. All had disease of three or more vertebrae with involvement of both the anterior and posterior columns and a progressive kyphotic deformity in spite of conservative treatment. We consider such spines to be 'unstable' and have found that anterior as well as posterior fusion with instrumentation is necessary.
