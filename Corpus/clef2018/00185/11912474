Spinal intradural endodermal cyst located anterior to the cervical spinal cord. Spinal endodermic cysts are rare and may be associated with other congenital anomalies (mediastinal cysts, bony defects of the vertebral body), derive from defective displacement of the endoderm of the intestinal tract or, more rarely, the respiratory one. The authors describe a case of endodermic cyst of the cervical spine localized anteriorly to the spinal cord. In the case we treated the patient was a 17-year-old male who presented hypostenia of the lower limbs accompanied by hyperreflexia and spasticity physical examination was negative. MRI, CT and CT-myelography documented a well-defined mass situated anteriorly to the spinal cord at C2-C4 level. A total-body CT-scan excluded the existence of other malformations. Surgery was performed via an anterior approach and the cyst completely removed. Histological examination confirmed the endodermal nature of the cyst. At long-term follow-up examination the patient was neurologically intact. Postoperative MRI showed a small residue of the cyst wall without spinal cord compression. Endodermic spinal cysts are very rare intradural lesions, predominantly with an anterior cervical localization, which derive from misplaced embryonic and endodermic cells. In the majority of cases, clinical onset is insidious and has a discontinuous progression. The best diagnostic tool is MRI. Treatment of choice is total surgical removal or emptying of the cyst followed by fenestration.
