Osteoid osteomas of the body of the cervical spine. Case report and review of the literature. A case report of an adult patient with an osteoid osteoma of the body of the 3rd cervical vertebra is presented. The long history of progressively worsening nocturnal cervical pain which was relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and an essentially normal clinical examination, are typical of this condition in which CT is the investigation of choice. Complete relief was obtained following excision of the lesion. The literature is reviewed.
