Surgical correction of the late consequences of posttraumatic spinal disorders. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the results of the treatment of late posttraumatic spinal disorders. Five patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis, two with paralytic kyphoscoliosis and two with posttraumatic instability with pain but without neurologic symptoms and apparent deformity, were treated surgically. Various surgical procedures were performed depending on the pathologic conditions. Corrections achieved in the sagittal and frontal planes were analyzed on radiographs after a mean follow-up of 4.4 years. In cases of angular kyphosis, the deformity measured 48.8 degrees on average before operation and 9.3 degrees afterward. Preoperative neurologic impairments were improved in all cases. Patients with paralytic scoliosis benefited from an average surgical correction of 68%. The restoration of truncal balance helped the patients to regain a normal sitting posture. Pain was reduced in all patients after surgery, as it was in patients with low back pain caused by posttraumatic instability without deformity. The results of the current study emphasize the importance of adequate management of spinal injuries to prevent late spinal sequelae.
