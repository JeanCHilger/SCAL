Practical points in evaluation and resuscitation of the injured child. The ultimate goal of resuscitation of an injured child is delivery of oxygen to intracellular organelles in order to maintain aerobic metabolism. This can be obtained by following ATLS protocols with immediate attention to the "ABCDE's" and compulsive reevaluation of the adequacy of resuscitation maneuvers. After stabilization, seriously injured children should be transferred to trauma centers with established pediatric trauma programs utilizing preexisting transfer agreements and protocols. Pediatric trauma is indeed a team endeavor, requiring the coordinated expertise and teamwork of prehospital EMS providers, trauma team members, and the pediatric trauma and rehabilitation centers. With careful and compulsive communication and coordination, injured children can be returned to their families in better mental and physical condition than pre-injury with reasonable expectation of a full and productive life.
