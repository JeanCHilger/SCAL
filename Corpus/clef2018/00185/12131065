Prediction of outcome in whiplash-associated disorders using West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory. To investigate the predictive capacity of the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) with regard to prolonged pain, using car occupants who had sustained a neck sprain in a traffic accident.A prospective cohort study including a one-year follow-up.One hundred thirty adults were examined by a specialized neck-injury team after a first visit to an accident and emergency department. The subjects answered the MPI questionnaire within one month of the accident.One year later, the patients answered a questionnaire about residual neck pain. The main outcome was determined by the question, "Do you have residual pain which you relate to the accident?"One hundred twenty-three (95%) of the subjects completed the study. Ninety-seven reported pain of some degree that they related to the accident. All but one of the MPI variables differed significantly between the group with residual pain and the group without pain. The variable interference had the strongest correlation with the outcome. Its discriminative capacity was 81% for those with pain and 94% for those without pain one year later.The MPI may be used at an early stage to identify patients who may develop chronic neck-pain after a traffic accident, at least in those who want a follow-up session after an initial visit to an accident and emergency department.
