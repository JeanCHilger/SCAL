Neck crepitance: evaluation and management of suspected upper aerodigestive tract injury. To determine safe criteria for the management of patients with crepitance of the neck.Upper aerodigestive tract injury may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Historically, this kind of injury has been managed by immediate surgical exploration, repair, and drainage. More recently, a nonoperative approach has been advocated.Retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the University of Louisville Trauma Center with suspected upper aerodigestive tract injury.We reviewed the charts of 236 patients admitted to the trauma service from 1995 to 1999 with the diagnosis of aerodigestive tract injury or subcutaneous emphysema.Nineteen patients were identified with cervical emphysema or cervical crepitance, or both, thought to be caused by an upper aerodigestive tract injury. The average patient age was 38.5 years 68% of patients were men. The mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle accident (43%), gunshot wound (37%), assault (10%), blunt neck trauma (5%), and stabbing (5%). Each patient presented with cervical emphysema shown by radiograph or crepitance, or bothThe findings show that suspected upper aerodigestive tract injury can be managed without surgery but that a high index of suspicion for airway compromise and associated facial injuries must be considered.
