Cervical spondyloptosis: a case report. A 5-year-old male child who had undergone orthopedic surgery for foot deformities three years prior presented to the outpatient clinic with a complaint of flexion restriction in both hands. The radiological evaluation of the patient showed C3-4 spondyloptosis. Halo traction was placed and posterior and anterior spinal fusions were performed respectively to achieve realignment of the spine. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient has been followed for 24 months. The etiology, diagnostic features and treatment options of childhood cervical spondyloptosis have been briefly reviewed and the pertinent literature discussed.
