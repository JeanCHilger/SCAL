Radiographic methods in the diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis. During one year period (from May 2000 to June 2001) 136 radiographic examinations were performed in Kulautuva tuberculosis hospital due to suspision of skeletal tuberculosis. Tuberculous spondilitis being most frequent presentation of skeletal tuberculosis, showed radiographic signs in 31 cases (22.8%). The role of conventional X-rays and computed tomography diagnosis of tuberculous spondilitis is reviewed. Early changes on plain films are non-specific making early diagnosis of spine tuberculosis a challenging task. In such cases spinal computed tomography may be helpful. Must frequently pathologic changes include high spectrum varying from osteoporosis to destruction of vertebrae and two or three vertebraes and intervertebrae disks are always involved.
