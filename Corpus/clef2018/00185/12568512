Contribution to the surgical treatment of patients with cervical spine cord injury using simple procedures. Thirty-nine patients with acute cervical spine fractures and/or dislocations between C3 and C7 were submitted to an anterior approach using bone graft fixation without screw and plate systems and three required a preliminary posterior approach to reduce a dislocation. Graft dislodgement due to technical problems occurred at a rate of 7.7% postoperatively and 2.8% 1 month later. No redislodgement occurred. All fusions became solid after 3 months. Their progress was based on the Frankel scale, before surgery, at the moment of the discharge, and at 6 months follow-up. This experience shows how patients with an acute cervical injury can improve even when admitted late after trauma.
