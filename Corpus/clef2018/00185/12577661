Radiation diagnosis of uncomplicated compression spinal fractures in children. Experiments on rabbits compared the X-ray, morphological, and magnetic resonance imaging of compression fractures of the vertebral body. Edema of the bone marrow of the vertebral body was ascertained to be a basic morphological substrate that evokes a modified MR signal. The data on 178 children with suspected compression fracture of the vertebral body were used to consider the potentialities of MRI and X-ray study in this pathology. The MRI semiotics of uncomplicated compression fractures of vertebral bodies is presented. The sensitivities of MRI and spondylography in the diagnosis of compression fractures of vertebral bodies were 100 and 62.5%, respectively.
