Cervical spondyloptosis caused by an aneurysmal bone cyst: a case report. The case of an 11-year-old patient with an aneurysmal bone cyst at C7, cervical spondyloptosis, and scoliosis of the lumbar spine is reported.To describe an unusual presentation of aneurysmal bone cyst causing painless cervical spondyloptosis.Aneurysmal bone cysts of the cervical spine are rare. There has never been a reported case of cervical dislocation by an aneurysmal bone cyst. This case highlights the potentially devastating effects that can be caused by benign tumors in the vertebral column.The history, clinical examination, imaging findings, and treatment are reviewed.The patient was treated with a single-stage combined posteroanteroposterior operation to resect the tumor, reduce the cervicothoracic dislocation, and create a three-column stabilization of the spine. The results were satisfactory, with an improvement in neurology.Aneurysmal bone cysts should be considered in the etiology of complicated scoliosis. Patients with a benign clinical history should be investigated at an early stage using appropriate imaging. Surgery is the treatment of choice when stability of the spine is compromised and neurologic signs are present.
