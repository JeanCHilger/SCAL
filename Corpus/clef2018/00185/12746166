Primary epidural burkitt lymphoma in a child: case presentation and literature review. Primary spinal epidural Burkitt lymphoma, presenting with signs of spinal cord compression, is very uncommon in childhood. Previously reported pediatric cases with isolated epidural Burkitt lymphoma had a high mortality, and survivors usually suffered serious neurologic sequelae. The authors present a 13-year-old female with isolated epidural Burkitt lymphoma with favorable outcome, and review the pediatric literature.
