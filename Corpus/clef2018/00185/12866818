Medical co-morbidities, secondary complications, and mortality in elderly with acute spinal cord injury. Despite an increasing incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the elderly and evidence that age appears to influence outcome after neurotrauma, surprisingly little is known regarding clinical outcomes and secondary complications in elderly with an acute SCI. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of age on clinical outcomes after acute traumatic SCI managed in an acute care unit by a multidisciplinary team. A retrospective chart review of all patients with acute SCI admitted to an acute care unit at a university hospital between 1998 and 2000 was performed. Data on clinical outcomes and secondary complications in younger individuals (group 1: age < 60 years) were compared to elderly subjects (group 2: age > or = 60 years). There were 28 elderly (age 60-89 years) and 30 younger (age 17-56 years) individuals. The severity and level of SCI were similar in both groups (p = 0.11 p = 0.93). Co-morbidities were more frequent in the elderly (p < 0.01). There was a trend, which did not achieve significance, for an increased incidence of secondary complications in the elderly (57.1% versus 33.3%
