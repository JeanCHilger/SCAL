Comparison of mandibular growth with other variables during puberty. The purpose of this investigation was to compare growth characteristics of the mandible during puberty with growth characteristics of the hyoid bone, cervical vertebrae, hand bones and standing height. Data were compiled from serial lateral cephalometric roentgenograms, hand-wrist roentgenograms and body height records of 33 Japanese girls between 9 and 14 years old. Records were updated annually. The mandibular growth rate differed from the other growth rates. The timing of maximum growth velocity of the mandible varied more widely than the timing of maximum growth velocity of the other parameters measured, and the total amount of mandibular growth did not correlate to any other measurement. The timing and magnitude of circumpubertal growth acceleration of various components of the body vary within a certain range of difference. However, the amount and timing of mandibular growth seems to be more variable than the other areas studied.
