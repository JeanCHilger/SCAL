Study of Hoffmann's reflex of the soleus muscle during spinal shock in man. The Hoffmann's reflex of the soleus muscle, was studied in 14 patients mith complete spinal cord section and spinal shock. This H reflex was absent in most of the cases seen before the 24th hour. In others or in subjects later examined, there was some abnormalities of the recruitement and recovery curves-wich progressively disappeared. These date bring new understandings on the pathophysiology of the spinal shock wich, even in man, early corresponds to a complete depression of the alpha-motoneurone excitability.
