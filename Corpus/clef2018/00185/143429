Aplasia of vertebral bodies (author's transl). The article reports two cases of congenital absence of vertebral bodies illustrated by radiographs. Only a few such cases have been reported in the literature. The author discusses whether the condition is to be considered as "asoma" (Putti) or absence of ossification of a pre-existing cartilagenous vertebral body. Its origin must lie in a very early teratogenic period of embryonic development.
