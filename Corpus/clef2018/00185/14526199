Anterior fusion and posterior correction of severe cervical kyphosis using pedicle screw fixation in a patient with neurofibromatosis: a case report. We present a 15-year-old boy with severe cervical kyphosis due to neurofibromatosis (NF), who underwent one-stage anterior fusion and posterior correction using pedicle screw fixation. The kyphosis was corrected from 72 degrees to 35 degrees. At the follow-up 16 months postoperatively, anterior fusion and posterior stabilization had been obtained without correction loss. Cervical pedicle screw fixation is a useful method for the correction of severe cervical kyphosis in patients with NF.
