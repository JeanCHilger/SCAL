Open reduction and internal fixation of a displaced transverse fracture of the sacrum with a locking compression plate. Isolated fractures of the distal sacrum are usually caused by direct trauma. Undisplaced fractures are easily missed on conventional X-ray films. CT scans can disclose the full extent of the fracture. Undisplaced, or minimally displaced fractures can be treated conservatively with analgesics and a restriction to seat for six weeks. In cases of major displacement or neurological symptoms, a digital transanal reduction of the fracture under local or regional anaesthesia can be attempted. If this manoeuvre fails, open reduction and internal fixation are required. Stabilisation is challenging because of the thin bone and the complex shape of the sacrum. In a 15 year old girl with major horizontal displacement and comminution of S4, following a snowboard accident, we achieved sufficient and stable fixation with the new LCP (Locking Compression Plate) system. For six weeks after the operation, the patient was not allowed to sit down. Thereafter, she was free of pain and unrestricted in daily activities and sport. The LCP system has a number of advantages in the fixation of fractures in osteoporotic or thin bone, but clinical experience/skill and careful planning of the operation are crucial.
