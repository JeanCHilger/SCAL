Nonsurgical treatment of a C6-7 unilateral locked facet joint in an infant. Case report. Cervical spine injuries in the pediatric population typically affect the upper cervical region. The authors present the first reported case of a subaxial C6-7 unilateral locked facet joint in a neurologically intact 10-month-old infant. To date, this patient's nonoperative treatment has been successful. The proposed biomechanical mechanism of this injury and the treatment paradigm are discussed.
