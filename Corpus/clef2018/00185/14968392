Posteromedial bowing of the lower leg and neuroblastoma with possible neurofibromatosis type I: a case report and literature review. The posteromedial bowing of the tibia is a rare condition that is not yet known to be related to neurofibromatosis. The case of a three month-old boy with the tentative diagnosis of neurofibromatosis is described. He developed paraplegia due to an abdominal neuroblastoma at the age of 9 months. This led us to a review of the literature.122 cases of posteromedial bowing of the tibia in 20 publications of the years 1949 - 2000 were analysed under special respect to gender, side of affection, shortening of the lower leg, treatment and possible cause.The posteromedial bowing of the lower leg seems to affect more boys as well as the left side. As far as described in all but one case it was the first delivery. Regularly, a limb shortening and pes calcaneovalgus is to be found. 99 children were treated conservatively, 21 got an operation of the affected side. In 19 performed osteotomies no pseudarthrosis occurred. One case of a fracture due to an adequate trauma without healing problems is described.
