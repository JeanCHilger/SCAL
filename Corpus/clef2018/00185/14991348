Cervical dystonia following peripheral trauma--a case-control study. Post-traumatic cervical dystonia as a diagnostic entity remains a subject of debate. Patients with cervical dystonia (CD) were asked to identify any significant illness prior to the onset of their CD. Sixteen patients of 95 respondents reported a history of injury in the four-week period prior to onset of their dystonia. A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of the 16 patients with early post-traumatic CD (CD-PT) in comparison with the 52 patients reporting no antecedent trauma (CD-NT) was performed. In this comparison the CD-PT group had a significantly increased frequency of laterocollis, significantly more reported pain and more reported depression. Non-significant trends were noted for less responsiveness to botulinum toxin and less use of gestes antagonistes in the CD-PT group. There were no group differences in the presence of a family history of dystonia. Eleven of the CD-PT group had been or were currently involved in litigation. A sub-group of seven CD-PT patients had laterocollis, six of whom conformed to a clinical pattern of persistent non-spasmodic laterocollis with marked pain all seven had been involved in litigation. This form of CD-PT is a distinct clinical entity and has an onset within hours or a few days of the trauma. In contrast, no significant differences were noted between patients with CD-NT and the eight patients with later onset of CD between 4 weeks and one year after peripheral trauma.
