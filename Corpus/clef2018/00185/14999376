Accuracy of CT-based navitation of pedicle screws in the thoracic spine compared with conventional technique. The goal of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of CT-based computer-assisted pedicle screw insertion in the thoracic spine in patients with fractures, metastases, and spondylodiscitis compared to a conventional technique. A total of 324 pedicle screws were inserted in the thoracic spines of 85 patients: 211 screws were placed using a CT-based optoelectronic navigation system assisted by an image intensifier and 113 screws were placed with a conventional technique. Screw positions were evaluated with postoperative CT scans by an independent radiologist. In the computer-assisted group, 174 (82.5%) screws were found completely within their pedicles compared with 77 (68.1%) correctly placed screws in the conventional group ( p<0.003). Despite use of the navigation system, 1.9% of the computer-assisted screws perforated the pedicle wall by more than 4 mm. The additional use of the image intensifier helped to identify the correct vertebral body and avoided cranial or caudal pedicle wall perforations.
