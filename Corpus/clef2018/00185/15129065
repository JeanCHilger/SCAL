Vertebral forward slippage in immature lumbar spine occurs following epiphyseal separation and its occurrence is unrelated to disc degeneration: is the pediatric spondylolisthesis a physis stress fracture of vertebral body? Radiographic and histologic evaluation of a rat model of lumbar spine slippage.To clarify the pathomechanism of slippage in the immature spine.There are controversial hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of slippage of the pediatric spine with pars defects. Some studies supported that disc degeneration was its cause, while others indicated the growth plate injury was the cause.An immature lumbar spine slippage model in 4-week-old rats was used. Following posterior destabilizing surgery, the lumbar spine was radiographically and histologically examined at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after surgery.Radiographically, slippage occurred about 7% in the % slip on day 7, and no slippage was observed before day 5. Histologically, epiphyseal separation also appeared on day 7 before day 5, the growth plate showed no abnormalities. Within 7 days after the operation, the anulus fibrosus did not show any sign indicating degeneration. The nucleus pulposus was also normal up to day 7.The findings of this study support the hypothesis that vertebral forward slippage of the immature spine occurs following epiphyseal separation and its occurrence is unrelated to disc degeneration.
