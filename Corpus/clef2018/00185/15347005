Evaluation and treatment of congenital and developmental anomalies of the cervical spine. Invited submission from the Joint Section Meeting on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves, March 2004. Congenital and developmental osseous abnormalities of the cervical spine can result in neural compression ranging from the medulla oblongata to the cervicothoracic spinal cord junction. These may present in infancy as scoliosis and even limb weakness. A high index of suspicion is essential. Neurodiagnostic imaging relies on high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) scanning and three-dimensional CT reconstructions as well as magnetic resonance imaging and angiography. The anatomical/physiological CT factors considered when developing a surgical approach are: 1) the stability and reducibility of the lesions 2) direction and manner of encroachment of the lesion on the neural structures
