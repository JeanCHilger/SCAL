Cervical disc calcification in children. A long-term review. Four cases of symptomatic cervical disc calcification in children are presented. Three cases were followed for more than 10 years. In one case, persistent flattening of the adjacent vertebral body remained into adulthood. To quantify the deformity, the height and width of each vertebral body was measured. These permanent changes may be associated with early degenerative changes seen radiologically in young adults.
