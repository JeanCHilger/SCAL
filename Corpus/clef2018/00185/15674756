Usefulness of constructive interference in steady state (CISS) imaging for the diagnosis and treatment of a large extradural spinal arachnoid cyst. We present a rare case of a symptomatic large extradural arachnoid cyst extending from the lower thoracic to sacral region in a 12-year-old boy, who presented with the signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression over 4 years. Since the pedicle of the cyst could not be delineated using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cine-mode MRI, and computed tomography scan, partial resection of the cyst was initially performed, which significantly improved motor function. After the first operation, a single pedicle was clearly demonstrated by 3D constructive interference in steady state (CISS) MRI. Thus, additional surgery aimed at closing the dural defect was performed to prevent future enlargement of the cyst. The operative findings were consistent with those of 3D CISS imaging. Clinical and radiological features of this lesion are discussed, focusing on the usefulness of 3D CISS MRI for preoperative evaluation, and especially for delineating the pedicle in cases of large extradural spinal arachnoid cysts.
