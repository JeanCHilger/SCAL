Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst causing cord compression in a 15-year-old girl: a case report. The authors describe the case of a fifteen-year-old girl with progressive paraparesis of the lower limbs that was caused by an intraspinal extradural dorsal arachnoid cyst at the level of Th 3-6. Diagnosis was established with MRI and MRI myelography. The latter revealed the CSF-like content of the cyst. The patient underwent laminotomy and en bloc resection of the cyst. Ligation of the pedicle of the cyst was done with laminoplasty. Quick and complete recovery was observed after surgery.
