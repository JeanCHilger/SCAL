Neuromuscular rehabilitation and electrodiagnosis. 4. Pediatric issues. This self-directed learning module highlights the physician's role in the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular disorders in pediatric populations. It is part of the chapter on neuromuscular rehabilitation and electrodiagnosis in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. This article discusses both clinical and electrodiagnostic features of common neuromuscular disorders in pediatric populations. The diagnostic value of somatosensory evoked potential is reviewed in a case of traumatic spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality. Therapeutic interventions of progressive muscular dystrophy are discussed, as well as the differential diagnosis of floppy infant syndrome, the most common pediatric electrodiagnostic referral.(a) To become familiar with electrodiagnosis and rehabilitation for common neuromuscular disorders in the pediatric population, (b) to undrstand electrodiagnostic findings of Guillain-Barre syndrome corresponding to pathophysiology, (c) to become familiar with somatosensory evoked potentials, and (d) to be able to make differential diagnosis of floppy infant syndrome based on clinical findings as well as electrodiagnosis.
