The morphological relations of eugnathia and class-II/1 and class-III malocclusions to the changes in the topography of the cervical spine in the lateral teleroentgenogram. Relations are discussed between malocclusions and changes of the vertebral spine. It was the aim of our investigations to disclose the causal relations between changes of the position of the cervical spine and class-II/1 anomalies (49 patients), class-III anomalies (28 patients), and eugnathic maxillary conditions (50 children). 127 lateral cephalograms of the untreated 63 boys and 64 girls at the age from six to 13 years were evaluated according to 24 orthodontic and 25 orthopedic characteristics. Patients with class-II/1 anomalies and class-III anomalies showed the tendency to strongly marked lordosis of the cervical spine. The basal angles nasion-tuberculum sellae-opisthion, nasion-tuberculum sellae-basion, and nasion-dorsum sellae-basion were enlarged in class-II/1 cases and reduced in class-III cases. It could not pointed out relations between the sagittal position of the jaws and the position of the atlas there was no existing a specific bearing of the head within the various groups.
