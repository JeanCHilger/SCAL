Cervical spondylodiscitis from an ingested pin: a case report. In the pediatric literature, only 1 case of cervical spondylodiscitis from an ingested foreign body is reported and this was caused by a blunt radiolucent foreign body. The authors now describe a unique case of a 13-year-old teenaged boy who presented with neck pain 6 days after accidental ingestion of a sewing pin. Uncomplicated removal of this pin was followed in 36 days by the development of cervical spondylodiscitis that failed conservative management and required surgical debridement and arthrodesis. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of this complication in any patient that presents with neck pain after foreign body ingestion.
