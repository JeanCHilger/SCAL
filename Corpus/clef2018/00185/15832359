Congenital anomaly of cervical vertebrae is a major complication of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS MIM# 180849) is a well-known malformation syndrome, characterized by broad thumbs and halluces, a characteristic facies, short stature, and mental retardation. RTS is accompanied by a variety of morbid complications, particularly of the skeleton. Based on the experience of five RTS patients with malformation of the craniovertebral junction, we draw attention to previously unrecognized life-threatening complications of RTS, including instability of C1-C2, os odontoideum, hypoplasia of the dens, and fusion of the cervical vertebrae. One patient developed severe cervical myelopathy. Malformation of the cervical spine may be a common syndromic constituent of RTS, to which special attention should be paid to prevent its neurologic sequelae.
