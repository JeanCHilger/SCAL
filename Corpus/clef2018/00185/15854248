Surgical management of remote, isolated type II odontoid fractures with atlantoaxial dislocation causing cervical compressive myelopathy. The remote (more than 6 mo after injury) and isolated (not associated with any other cervical spinal fractures) Type II fractures of the odontoid (RI IIO) are unique in being inherently unstable and prone to malunion or nonunion, leading to cervical compressive myelopathy. The present study discusses their surgical management.Nineteen patients with RI IIO with atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) causing compressive myelopathy were treated. Their preoperative disability was graded as Grade I: neurologically intact (presented with hyperreflexia and mild spasticity n = 3)At follow-up (mean, 15.37 +/- 9.67 mo), three patients in Grade I maintained their neurological status. Of the seven patients in Grade II and six in Grade III, five had improved to Grade I, and eight were in Grade II. The three patients in Grade IV improved to Grade I, II, and III, respectively.The patients with RI IIO may be divided into five groups on the basis of their differing management protocols. There is a considerable risk of delayed myelopathy unless surgical reduction and stabilization are performed. Posterior stabilization is the preferred option in dealing with these fractures. Despite the presence of severe neurological deficits and the prolonged duration of symptoms, a significant neurological improvement usually occurs after surgery.
