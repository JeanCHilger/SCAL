Epidural compression in neuroblastoma: Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. The involvement by tumour of intervertebral foramina and the consequent invasion of the spinal space, accompanied or not by neurological symptoms, represent a well-recognised pattern of presentation of neuroblastoma. The main peculiarity of this condition stands in the fact that, in case of its late detection or inadequate treatment, severe, permanent neurological compromise may ensue. Surprisingly enough, remarkable disagreements still exist regarding its optimal treatment and the related literature provide contrasting indications at this respect. The neurosurgical and the chemotherapeutic approaches have equally convinced supporters, while the use of radiation therapy is uncommon, possibly without good reasons. This mini-review intends to report the clinical experiences of the major Paediatric Oncology Groups with the aim to collect as many data as possible in the perspective of establishing common guidelines for proper diagnosing and treatment of this important complication.
