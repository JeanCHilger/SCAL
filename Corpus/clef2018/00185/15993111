Pediatric spine injuries. Pediatric spine injuries are rare, not only due to the plasticity of the pediatric spine, but also due to the difficulty of diagnosis and the usually severe, if not fatal, associated injuries. Mechanisms of injury, transportation, initial management, diagnostic exams, and management of such lesions are different from those of the adult, and an individualized approach to each case, looking for specific injury patterns, avoids misdiagnosis. The goal of this manuscripts is to summarize the specific spinal injury patterns of the pediatric population, as well as the present literature regarding their diagnosis and treatment.
