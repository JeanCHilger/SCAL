Emergency pediatric imaging: changes over the years (Part I). We have lived through an enormous era of technical advance and data acquisition and transfer. Radiology (imaging), has come out of this very strong and has spread to new endeavors and other disciplines. One of the major changes has been the enormous expansion of digital, cross-sectional, imaging. Just how this has affected pediatric radiology in terms of the skull and spine is the subject of this communication. The overall message is that we must keep a blend of plain films and digital cross-section studies and know what to keep and what to let go.
