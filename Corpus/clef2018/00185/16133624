Embolization of transected vertebral arteries in unstable trauma patients. The aim of this paper is to report our experience with coil embolization for the treatment of vertebral artery transection in unstable trauma patients. The course of four patients admitted to our units between 1998 and 2003 with traumatic injuries of the upper thorax or neck is described. All had unstable hemodynamic parameters at presentation. Emergent arteriogram revealed vertebral artery transection, which was managed by immediate coil embolization proximal to the injury site. Initial technical success was achieved in all four patients, with hemodynamic improvement. No further treatment or surgery to control the vessel injury was needed. There were no immediate or late complications of the procedure and no neurological sequelae. Emergency coil embolization is an effective endovascular technique for use in unstable patients with angiography findings of a transected vertebral artery.
