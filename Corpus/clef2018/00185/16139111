Forensic assessment of survived strangulation. By a retrospective analysis of all survived strangulation cases examined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Berne, Switzerland between 1987 and 2002, the authors tried to find out, if findings and symptoms of victims could be related to the fierceness of the assault and the mode of strangulation and if general evaluation criteria could be established on the basis of objective findings. One hundred and thirty-four survived strangulation cases were analysed on the basis of written reports, photographies and schematical sketches. Findings and symptoms reflected the fierceness of the assault in 71% of all cases by displaying a continuum of findings from minor injuries to severe traumatisation. This applied especially for cases of manual strangulation while other modes of strangulation resulted in different constellations of findings. As a result of this study, the authors deem the following classification of three degrees of severity as practical on condition that a complete forensic medical examination was performed upon the surviving victim shortly after the incident of strangulation: Light strangulation, confined to skin abrasions and/or reddening of the skin of the neck. Moderate strangulation, defined as bruising to, and/or bleeding from the neck, and/or damage to deeper soft tissues or the larynx, as exhibited by the symptoms of sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, and hoarseness. Severe, life-threatening strangulation if the victim presents petechial bleedings as a result of venous congestion with or without accompanying loss of consciousness.
