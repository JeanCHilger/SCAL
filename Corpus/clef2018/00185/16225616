Familial brachioradial pruritus. The cause of brachioradial pruritus (a localized itching on the arms or shoulders) is controversial. A hereditary form of this condition has not been reported.To describe the occurrence of brachioradial pruritus in several members of one family.The pedigree of the three generations and the history of brachioradial pruritus was outlined. Four sisters were investigated by radiography of the cervical spine.Five sisters and one brother, together with five of their daughters suffered from recurring brachioradial pruritus. The sisters had had occupations requiring heavy lifting, spent much time outdoors and exposed themselves extensively to the sun. Several complained of neck pain and cervical radiographs of four of them indicated arthrosis.Spinal disease alone cannot explain the symptoms of brachioradial pruritus, which in our patients was characterized by symptom-free periods broken off by relapse late in the summer each year. The pedigree suggests this hereditary form of brachioradial pruritus to be dominant and possibly X-linked.
