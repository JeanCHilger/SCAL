Neurenteric cyst: case report and a review of the potential dysembryology. We report a 13-year-old female who presented to an outside emergency room following blunt trauma to the head. As part of her evaluation, an unenhanced CT of the face and radiographs of the cervical spine were performed. She was referred to our clinic with "abnormal" imaging. Radiographs revealed dysmorphic cervical spine and ventral clefting of the vertebral bodies from C7-T2. A subsequent MRI was obtained that demonstrated a large spinal cord mass. MRI demonstrated an unenhanced intramedullary mass of the cervicothoracic spinal cord measuring approximately 1.5 cm in greatest axial diameter. Surgical exploration of her intraspinal mass revealed a neurenteric cyst. Spinal neurenteric cysts are categorized in the spectra of occult spinal dysraphism and most likely arise from incomplete separation of the developing notochord and foregut in the embryo. We discuss potential etiologies for the formation of such cysts. The clinician should consider neurenteric cysts in their differential diagnosis of patients with spinal dysraphism and/or intraspinal masses.
