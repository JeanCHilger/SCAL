High degree of discordance between three-dimensional and two-dimensional lumbar spine bone mineral density in Turner's syndrome. Low bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has been described in Turner's syndrome (TS). One of the error factors of DXA is short stature, a common finding in TS patients. Aimed to evaluate the influence of a low stature on BMD, we compared the two-dimensional (2D) or conventional BMD (cBMD) with three-dimensional (3D) or volumetric BMD (vBMD) in 62 females (10 to 48 yr old) with TS diagnosis in a case control study. They were compared to 102 normal females (7 to 45 yr old) grouped by age-ranges. All patients were subjected to a lumbar spine densitometry by DXA in the PA and lateral projections, obtained the cBMD and vBMD and calculated for the apparent BMD (appBMD). In TS, the mean of Z-score for cBMD was significantly lower than that for vBMD and for appBMD (-2.31 +/- 1.42 -0.64 +/- 1.55
