Continuous intrathecal baclofen treatment of severe spasms in two children with spinal-cord injury. This study reports the use of intrathecal baclofen in two ventilator-dependent children with severe spasms secondary to spinal-cord injury. Baclofen was delivered via a subcutaneously implanted, programmable pump. The children were followed for 12 and 24 months. Baclofen dramatically reduced spasms, resulting in more stable ventilation, improved ease of care, reduced distress and better integration into the community. Although effective, intrathecal baclofen represents a significant intervention careful consideration must be given to potential complications and the need for long-term management. Full effectiveness was dependent on free CSF flow.
