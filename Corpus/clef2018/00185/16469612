Penile prosthetic surgery in neurologically impaired patients: long-term followup. Penile prosthetics are a viable option for erectile dysfunction in neurologically impaired patients. Penile implants can also be used to facilitate the management of urinary drainage when penile retraction has made this difficult.Between 1980 and 1996, 245 neurologically impaired patients with a mean age of 40.8 years (range 16 to 75), including 188 with paraplegia, 57 with quadriplegia and 197 with spinal cord injuries, were treated for erectile dysfunction and/or urinary incontinence with penile prosthesis implantation. The mean history of paralysis was 11.2 years (range 1 to 52). After neuro-urological evaluation all patients included in this study were considered candidates for penile prosthesis implantation. A followup program for treatment success, patient satisfaction, problems and complications was subsequently initiated.During 17 years a total of 293 surgical procedures in 245 patients were done with the implantation of 147 semirigid (Jonas), 113 self-contained inflatable (Dynaflex) and 33 inflatable 3-piece (AMS 700) prostheses. There were 3 patient groups based on the indication for penile prosthetic surgery, namely group 1-134 patients with urinary management only, group 2-60 with erectile dysfunction only, and group 3-51 with urinary management and erectile dysfunction. At a mean followup of 7.2 years (maximum 17) 195 patients were reevaluated in clinic. In 122 patients (90.3%) urinary management problems were resolved. Erectile dysfunction treatment was successful in 76 patients (82.6%). There were 43 revisions for technical reasons and infections. The infection rate was 5% (12 patients). The perforation rate was different for different implant devices, that is 18.1% (15 of 83 cases) for semirigid devices, 2.4% (2 of 84) for self-contained inflatable devices and 0% (0 of 28) for inflatable 3-piece devices.The implantation of a penile prosthesis is a safe procedure for erectile dysfunction and/or urinary incontinence in neurologically impaired patients. Based on technical advances the complication rates significantly decreased during the years. The implantation of an inflatable 3-piece penile prosthesis in a neurologically impaired patient is a safe and viable procedure. Indications include the management of erectile dysfunction and problematic urinary collection.
