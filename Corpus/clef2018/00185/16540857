Retrospective study of cervical arthrodesis in patients with various types of skeletal dysplasia. Retrospective prognostic study.To evaluate the safety and efficacy of cervical arthrodesis for cervical instability in patients with skeletal dysplasia.Individuals with certain skeletal dysplasias have a high incidence of cervical instability, which can lead to compression of the spinal cord and subsequent severe spinal cord symptoms, progressive neurologic decline, quadriplegia, and death.The charts of 25 patients with skeletal dysplasia (spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, Morquio, or Kniest) who had undergone cervical arthrodesis to treat instability were reviewed for evidence of fusion, neurologic improvement, and complications.Of the 25 patients, 23 (92%) achieved a solid bony fusion, and 5 (20%) experienced surgery-related complications. One of the two patients who did not achieve fusion had a stable pseudarthrosis without neurologic complications, and additional surgical intervention was unnecessary the second patient is contemplating revision surgery. Of 16 patients with preoperative neurologic manifestations, 14 (88%) experienced improvement.Cervical arthrodesis can be a safe and effective treatment for patients with skeletal dysplasia and cervical instability, despite the inherent complications associated with a dysplastic skeleton. The procedure can preserve and/or improve neurologic function while minimizing the risk of neurologic injury from spinal cord compression.
