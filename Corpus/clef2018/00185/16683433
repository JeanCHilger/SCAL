Comparison of restoring and maintaining the cervical curvature and height by using three different anterior cervical plate systems. To investigate and compare the effects of restoring and maintaining the cervical curvature and height of the fused segment by using three different anterior cervical plate systems.From January 2002 to June 2004, 122 patients underwent anterior cervical decompression, autogenous iliac bone graft and plate fixation. Of the 122 patients (85 males, 37 females, aged 14-70), 37 underwent surgery involving the fixation with the Orion plate system, 39 with the Zephir plate system, and 46 with the Codman plate system. The cervical curvature and height of the fused segment were measured on the lateral X-ray films so as to compare the changes of the conditions preoperatively, 1 week after surgery, and during the follow-up, and also to compare the difference among the three groups.The follow-up of the patients for 6-35 months (average 17.3 months) showed that all the patients developed the bone fusion 6 months after operation. There was a significant improvement in the cervical curvature and height of the fused segment before operation versus 1 week after operation (P < 0.05) however, there were no significant changes 1 week after operation versus during the follow-up in each group(P > 0.05)The three plate systems can effectively reconstruct and maintain the cervical curvature and height of the fused segment, with a satisfactory effect in a short term.
