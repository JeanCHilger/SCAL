Allogenous bone plate reconstructing spinal channel and grafting in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture with paraplegia. To evaluate the method of the allogenous bone plate reconstructing the spinal channel and grafting in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture with paraplegia.Thirty-six patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture with paraplegia were included in this study. Their ages ranged from 18 to 56 (average, 38). The vertebral injury involved T11 in 3 patients, T12 in 10 patients, L1 in 14 patients, L2 in 7 patients, and L3 in 2 patients. Neurological deficits were classified by the Frankel grading. There were 9 patients in grade A, 11 patients in grade B, 13 patients in grade C, and 3 patients in grade D. All the patients were treated with the anterior approach, decompression of the spinal channel, interbody graft, and internal fixation. The grafting materials consisted of the allogenous femoral bone plate that was decreased in advance and implanted in the intervertebral posterior region, with cut ribs and bone mills during the decompression.Postoperative CT scanning showed clearance of the spinal cord compression and expansion of the spine channel. During the follow-up period averaged 2 years, almost all the patients showed an improvement in the neurological function. Spinal fusion occurred in 32 patients. There was no screw loosened or broken. Only 1 patient failed to achieve the fusion.The anterior approach, allograft bone plate reconstructing the spine channel is a safe and effective method in treatment of the thoracolumbar burst fracture with paraplegia, which may be a replacement of the autogenous iliac bone graft.
