Influence factors for functional improvement after olfactory ensheathing cell transplantation for chronic spinal cord injury. To explore the influence factors for the functional improvement after the fetal olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation for chronic spinal cord injury(SCI).The olfactory bulbs were harvested and trypsinized down to single fetal OEC. They were cultured for 12-17 days prepared for use. From November 2001 to December 2003, a total of 300 patients volunteered for the fetal OEC transplantation, among whom 222 suffered from complete chronic SCI and 78 suffered from incomplete chronic SCI. The procedures were performed on the patients with a disease course ranging from 6 months to 31 years (average 3.1 years) after their injuries. The fetal OEC was transplanted by the form of injections into the spinal cord at the upper and lower ends of the injury site. All the patients were assessed by the ASIA standard before the transplantation and 2-8 weeks after the transplantation. The influence factors including age, sex, duration after the injury, and injury degrees and levels were compared with those in the functional improvement after fetal OEC transplantation.The partially-improved neurological functions assessed by the ASIA standard were indicated by the motor scores increasing from 39.1 +/- 20.6 to 45.9 +/- 20.3 (P < 0.001), the light touch scores from 51.7 +/- 24.9 to 63.4 +/- 23.0 (P < 0.001), and the pin prick scores from 53.0 +/- 24.2 to 65.3 +/- 22.7 (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the functional improvement of the motor, light touch, and pin brick when compared with the age, sex, duration after the injury, and the injury degrees and levels. The motor scores and light touch scores at the cervical level were higher than the scores at the thoracic level.The fetal OEC transplantation can partially improve the neurological functions quickly in treatment of the chronic spinal cord injury. All the influence factors except the motor scores and light touch scores, which were higher at the cervical level than at thoracic level, have no impact on the functional improvement after the fetal OEC transplantation.
