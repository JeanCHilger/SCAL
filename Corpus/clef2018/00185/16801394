Spontaneous tracheal rupture after severe coughing in a 7-year-old boy. Tracheal lacerations are rare but potentially life-threatening. They are recognized sequelae of cervical or thoracic injuries or complications of endotracheal intubation. Spontaneous tracheal rupture is extremely uncommon and has not been reported in a pediatric patient. This report is the first pediatric case of a spontaneous longitudinal laceration of the posterior membranous cervical trachea, which occurred after violent coughing in a 7-year-old boy with acute tracheobronchitis. The tracheal rupture was detected early with an endoscopic examination and computed tomography. The rupture and emphysema were small, with no major complications, and disappeared with conservative management. This rare case is presented with a review of the possible mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment.
