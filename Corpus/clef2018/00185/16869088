Efficacy of surgical decompression in the setting of complete thoracic spinal cord injury. An assessment of neurological improvement after surgical intervention in the setting of traumatic thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI).A retrospective evaluation of a nonconsecutive cohort of patients with a thoracic SCI from T2 to T11. The analysis included a total of 12 eligible patients. The neurologic and functional outcomes were recorded from the acute hospital admission to the most recent follow-up. Data included patient age, level of injury, neurologic examination according to the Frankel grading system, the performance of surgery, and the mechanism of the time-related SCI decompression.All patients had a complete thoracic SCI. The median interval from injury to surgery was 11 days (range, 1-36 days). Decompression, bone fusion, and instrumentation were the most common surgical procedures performed. The median length of follow-up was 18 months after surgery (range, 9-132 months). Motor functional improvement was seen in 1 patient (Frankel A to C).Surgical decompression and fusion imparts no apparent benefit in terms of neurologic improvement (spinal cord) in the setting of a complete traumatic thoracic SCI. To better define the role of surgical decompression and stabilization in the setting of a complete SCI, randomized, controlled, prospective studies are necessary.
