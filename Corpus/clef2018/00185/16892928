Intermittent catheterization in the rehabilitation setting: a comparison of clean and sterile technique. To compare the onset of symptomatic urinary tract infection in individuals with spinal cord injury in a rehabilitation setting who are randomized to clean or sterile intermittent catheterization technique.Randomized controlled design.Spinal cord rehabilitation units in western Canada.Thirty-six patients with cervical spinal cord injuries requiring intermittent catheterization by nursing staff were recruited. None had a previous history of voiding dysfunction or urinary tract infections.Subjects were randomized to either clean or sterile intermittent catheterization technique. Protocols for both clean and sterile techniques were standardized and followed by nursing staff and caregivers.Primary outcome measure was symptomatic urinary tract infection as diagnosed by urine culture > or = 10(5) colony-forming units/mL, pyuria (> or =10 leukocytes on high-power field), and accompanying symptoms.A total of 189 urine specimens from 36 subjects were cultured. Of the 36 subjects, 15 (43%) developed a symptomatic urinary tract infection: 6/16 (37%) from the clean group 9/20 (45%) from the sterile group (P> 0.05). Mean time to onset for symptomatic urinary tract infection for the clean group was 3.0 (standard deviation (SD) 2.4) weeks and for the sterile group, 3.6 (SD 1.3) weeks (P> 0.05). The most common urinary organisms at onset of symptomatic urinary tract infection were Enterococcus species followed by Klebsiella.Clean intermittent catheterization in the rehabilitation setting does not appear to place the patient with spinal cord injury at increased risk for developing symptomatic urinary tract infection, and has significant cost and time saving benefits for the health care system, as well as enhancing the transition for the patient from rehabilitation to community.
