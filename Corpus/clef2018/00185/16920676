Strength and mobility of the neck-shoulder region in adolescent headache. The significance of the musculoskeletal function of the neck-shoulder region in different headache types in children and adolescents is not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between different types of headache and the strength and mobility of the neck-shoulder region in 13-year-old schoolchildren. A structured questionnaire on headache was sent to all 1,409 children in the sixth grade in the city of Turku. Of the 1,135 (81%) children who completed the questionnaire, a sample from different headache groups was randomly selected for clinical examination. The study consisted of 59 children with migraine, 65 with episodic tension-type headache (TTHA), and 59 headache-free controls. Dynamic muscle strength of the upper extremities (UE endurance), mobility of both shoulders (UE mobility), and the cervical range of motion (CROM) were measured. Girls with episodic TTHA had lower UE endurance of both dominant and nondominant sides than girls in the other study groups. Girls with migraine had lower UE endurance of nondominant side than girls in the control group. In boys, no significant differences were observed. An interesting association between the function of the neck-shoulder region and headache complaints in adolescents was ascertained.
