Spasmodic torticollis caused by metoclopramide: a rare etiology of C1-C2 rotatory pseudoluxation in children. Torticollis in children must always instigate a search for trauma. Many other etiologies can be found. The authors report a case of postmedicinal atlantoaxial rotatory pseudoluxation (AARP) occurring in a child. This child had fallen down in the morning with head trauma followed by headache. Clinically, a stiff neck with an irreducible right rotation of his neck, and an osteotendinous hyperreflexia were noted. There was a C1-C2 rotatory dislocation with no traumatic lesion on the cervical CT scan. After a few hours, the torticollis spontaneously reduced and then reappeared on the left side. This clinical fluctuation and the absorption of metoclopramide (Primp√©ran) started in the morning for acute gastroenteritis provided the diagnosis of AARP. This entity was confirmed by the good clinical and radiological follow-up and was caused by the substantial ligament laxity of the craniovertebral junction encountered in children. The analysis of medical imaging and the systematic search for a medicinal cause helped make the right diagnosis.
