Radiofrequency ablation of a cervical osteoid osteoma: a trans-thyroid approach. We present a 16-year-old girl with an osteoid osteoma in the vertebral body of C5. Given the difficulty of surgically treating the lesion, radiofrequency ablation was used. Percutaneous needle access to this lesion in the anterior aspect of the cervical vertebral body was limited by the many critical adjacent structures. We present our successful treatment of this lesion utilizing a trans-thyroid needle approach.
