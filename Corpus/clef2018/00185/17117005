Airbag-mediated pediatric atlanto-occipital dislocation. Pediatric atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) most commonly occurs in victims of high-velocity motor vehicle collisions and usually results in death. The mechanical and anatomic predisposing factors for AOD in children have been well documented. With the introduction of passenger-side air bags in automobiles, reports have documented an increased incidence of pediatric cervical spine injuries, including AOD, in low-speed motor vehicle collisions. Although long-term survival in AOD is so unusual that there is no separate literature regarding its physiatric treatment, it is generally treated like any other high cervical spinal cord injury. Recent advances in adaptive technology have aided greatly in management. Despite benefits that adaptive technology affords, the best treatment for AOD is still prevention. For this reason, children under the age of 13 should be restrained backseat passengers in automobiles.
