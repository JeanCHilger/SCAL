Management of transperitoneal gunshot wounds of the spine. To evaluate the results of a conservative approach to gunshot wounds of the spine with a transperitoneal trajectory, we analyzed our 4-year experience with 21 patients. The management protocol consisted of standard treatment of the intra-abdominal injuries, vigorous irrigation of the missile track, and a 48-hour course of antibiotic therapy. The lumbar spine was involved in 14 patients (67%) and the thoracic spine was injured in seven (33%). Eleven patients (52%) were paraplegic on admission and ten patients (48%) had a fixed partial neurologic deficit. One patient with an ISS of 75 died intraoperatively from exsanguination (mortality, 5%). Early morbidity correlated with ISS greater than 40 and spinal AIS greater than 3. Late nonneurologic morbidity was independent of ISS and spinal AIS. One patient required reoperation for a retroperitoneal abscess secondary to a leak from a repaired ureter. Another patient had a retroperitoneal collection on a CT scan which resolved spontaneously. There were no spinal or paraspinal infectious complications in the presence (five cases) or absence of a colonic injury. No change in neurologic status was observed in any patient during a mean follow-up period of 3 months. This preliminary experience suggests that a conservative approach consisting of irrigation of the missile track and short-term antibiotic therapy without laminectomy or removal of fragments from the spinal canal yields optimal results without increasing infectious complications of the spine.
