Locomotor training within an inpatient rehabilitation program after pediatric incomplete spinal cord injury. The outcomes of intense locomotor training after incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) have been described in adults with acute and chronic injuries and with various levels of ambulatory function. This case report describes a comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation program with a locomotor training component in a child with a severe incomplete SCI.A 5-year-old girl injured at C4 participated in locomotor training for 5 months during inpatient rehabilitation.The patient's Functional Independence Measure for Children II (WeeFIM II) mobility score increased from 5/35 to 21/35. Her Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI II) score improved from 0 to 12. The patient returned to walking in the community with assistive devices.It is feasible to include an intense locomotor training program in the clinical rehabilitation setting for a child with a severe SCI, and the outcomes were consistent with results in adults. Further investigation with experimental designs and more participants will determine the extent to which this intervention benefits the pediatric population with SCI.
