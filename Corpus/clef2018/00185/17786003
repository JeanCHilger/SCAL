Cervical nerve root synovial sarcoma in a child with chromosomal (X18) translocation. Case report and review of the literature. We report on an 11-year-old female with a history of cervicobrachialgia and progressive weakness of the right arm. Cervical spine MRI showed an enhancing heterogeneous intradural mass occupying the right C6-C7 foramen. She underwent a right C6-C7 foraminotomy with a complete macroscopic removal of the lesion. Pathological examination revealed a synovial sarcoma. Treatment was completed by chemotherapy and proton radiotherapy, and the girl remained free of symptoms for 3 years. After appearance of new symptoms, a local recurrence was confirmed, and despite aggressive treatment with salvage chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the disease progressed beyond medical control, and the child died, 6 years after diagnosis. Early recognition of this rare entity compared to its more benign differential diagnosis is crucial, as an aggressive management is needed.
