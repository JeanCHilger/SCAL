Evolving standards of practice for cervical spine imaging in trauma: a retrospective review. Recently published works on radiology and emergency medicine suggest an increasing role for primary CT imaging of the cervical spine (C-spine) in trauma, rather than plain X-rays. This observational retrospective study of 406 patients was undertaken to examine current practice in a metropolitan teaching hospital setting and to define factors affecting the use of primary imaging for suspected C-spine fracture. This study supports the increasing recognition of the limited accuracy and adequacy of plain films, especially among the more severely injured patients. It is suggested that intubated patients, patients with severe trauma or patients with Glasgow Coma Scale <13 have CT as a primary screening examination for suspected C-spine fracture rather than X-ray. Patients having head CT for suspected intracranial injury may also benefit from included C-spine CT. The increasing usage of primary CT will increase overall imaging costs and resource utilization.
