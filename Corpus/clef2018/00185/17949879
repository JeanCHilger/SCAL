Use of a vascularized fibula for spinal reconstruction in neurofibromatosis. We report a case of reconstruction of a dysplasic thoracic spine with vascularized fibula in Recklinghausen's disease. We present the case of a thirteen-year-old lady with neurofibromatosis type 1 who developed a dystrophic thoracic kyphoscoliosis. A T9 compression due to a severe scaloping of the thoracic spine caused an important deformation and a medullar compression (with dorsal pain, right sciatica and a pyramidal syndrome). The surgery consisted in medullar liberation by a T9-T10 corporectomy and an osteosynthesis with arthrodesis T3-L3. A free vascularized fibula bone graft, with an end-to-end anastomosis on a thoracic pedicle, was realized to fill the T8-T11 spinal defect. All the symptoms decreased after surgery and the patient could walk normally few months later. At one-year follow-up the radiographs showed a stable montage and a solid bony fusion. Analysing the literature, vascularized bone graft can be recommended to fill the bony spinal defect due to surgery in cases of tumor, infection, trauma or severe scoliosis. Compared to non-vascularized grafts, which are exposed to resorption, fatigue fracture and then instability, the vascularized fibula grafts provide a rapid fusion, a biomechanically stable and long-standing support with low risks of infection.
