Health-related outcomes of people with spinal cord injury--a 10 year longitudinal study. Longitudinal panel design over 10 years.To describe the health outcomes for people with spinal cord injury and identify how indicators of health change over time.Queensland, Australia.A structured interview consisting of measures of perceived health, medical service utilization, hospitalization and pressure sore occurrence was administered on six occasions over 10 years after discharge from the hospital following the initial rehabilitation episode.The majority of respondents were relatively healthy over the course of the 10-year study and required minimal medical interventions or hospitalization. There was however a group of up to 20% of respondents who required extensive medical intervention, including hospitalization and pressure sore management.The findings have significant implications for health-care policy and strategic planning for the ongoing management of spinal cord injury. A biopsychosocial approach combining patient education, cognitive behavioral interventions, screening and treatment for affective disorders and environmental interventions is recommended to facilitate optimal health outcomes for people with spinal cord injury over the long term.
