Superfluous computed tomography utilization for the evaluation of the pelvis and spinal column in an orthopedic emergency department. This study was designed to investigate the frequency of requests for computed tomography (CT) examination of the spinal column and pelvis in our emergency orthopedic department, the reasons of requests, and the rates of positive and negative CT examinations.We retrospectively reviewed patients for whom a request for CT examination was made by the emergency orthopedic department within a year (September 2005- 2006). The reasons for CT requests, findings in CT reports, and age and sex of the patients were recorded. Findings unrelated and related to the original request denoted a negative and positive CT examination, respectively.Of 24,378 admissions to our emergency orthopedic department, a CT scan was requested in 1,295 patients (5.3%). In 817 patients (63.1%), CT examination involved the pelvis or the spinal column. Of these, 418 CT scans (51.2%) yielded a negative result. The mean age of the patients with a negative CT scan was significantly lower than those having a positive CT scan (40.7 vs 45.1 years p=0.001). There was no significant difference with respect to sex between patients having negative and positive CT findings (p=0.670). Compared to pelvis CT scans, the frequency of negative CTs was significantly higher for spinal column examinations (p<0.001). The incidence of negative CT scans for upper thoracic and cervical vertebrae was significantly higher than that found for lower thoracic and lumbar regions (p<0.001).The high incidence of negative CT scans documented for pelvic and spinal column examinations underlines the need for measures to avoid superfluous CT requests in emergency departments.
