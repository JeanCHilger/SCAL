Anatomy and biomechanics of normal craniovertebral junction (a) and biomechanics of stabilization (b). A knowledge of the bony configuration, ligamentous attachments, joint articulations, vascular supply, muscle function, and lymphatic drainage as well as the kinetic anatomy of the craniocervical junction is necessary to understand the etiology of abnormalities in this area and their treatment.The craniovertebral junction (CVJ) is the most mobile of the upper cervical spine especially in children. It is uniquely adapted for stability and motion. The bony anatomy and the normal biomechanics of the CVJ in children are presented and subsequently the biomechanics of complex stabilization. Our review of more than 600 children who required stabilization is presented.
