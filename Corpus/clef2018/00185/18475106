Case report: Brown-Séquard syndrome resulting from a ski injury in a 7-year-old male. Cervical spine and spinal cord injuries are rare in pediatric trauma victims. The majority result from blunt trauma. Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality has been reported to be more common among young children than adults. The Brown-Séquard syndrome is rarely seen as the result of blunt trauma. We present the case of young boy who suffered spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality resulting in the Brown-Séquard syndrome and review the controversy surrounding the use of high-dose corticosteroids in the treatment of pediatric spinal cord injury. Current data do not support the use of corticosteroids as 'standard of care' for this population.
