A prospective cohort study comparing the VAS spine score and Roland-Morris disability questionnaire in patients with a type A traumatic thoracolumbar spinal fracture. The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-24) and the VAS spine score have been regularly used to measure functional outcome in patients with back pain. The RMDQ-24 is primarily used in degenerative disease of the spine and the VAS Spine is used in trauma patients. The aim of this study is to compare these scores and to see if there is a correlation in patients with a traumatic thoracolumbar spinal fracture. Prospective cohort study comparing the RMDQ-24 and the VAS spine score in patients with a traumatic type A fracture thoracolumbar spine fracture. Fifteen non-operatively patients (group one) completed 118 questionnaires and 17 operatively treated patients (group two) completed 140 questionnaires. Group one scored an average of 6.6 and 65.9 for the RMDQ-24 and VAS Spine, in group two this was 5.1 and 82.9. Spearman's correlation test showed a significant correlation, in group one 0.83 and for the second group 0.87. RMDQ-24 and VAS Spine have a strong positive correlation in measuring disability in a group of patients with back pain because of a spinal fracture. In both non-operatively and operatively treated groups this correlation is significant.
