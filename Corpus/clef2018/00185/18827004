Prevalence of vertebral fractures in men with acromegaly. Data on osteoporotic fractures in acromegaly are limited. An increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was already observed in postmenopausal women with active acromegaly. It is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in acromegaly.This was a cross-sectional study.The study was conducted at referral centers.Subjects included 40 males with acromegaly (25 patients with controlled disease and 15 patients with active disease) and 31 control males, with age and gonadal status comparable with the patients.Evaluation of vertebral fractures (quantitative morphometric analysis) and bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine and total hip (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) was done.Vertebral fractures were assessed.Although BMD was not significantly different between acromegalic patients and control subjects, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was higher in acromegalic patients as compared with the control subjects (57.5 vs. 22.6% chi(2): 8.7This study reports for the first time a high prevalence of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in an unselected acromegalic male population generally considered at low risk of osteoporosis, suggesting that complicated osteoporosis is an important comorbidity of acromegaly.
