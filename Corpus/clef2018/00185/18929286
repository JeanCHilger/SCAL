Congenital cervical spine fusion and airway management: a case series of Klippel-Feil syndrome. To determine the ideal airway management modalities in general anesthesia for pediatric patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome, a disorder that is characterized by abnormalities of the cervical spine and craniofacial structures that may impede successful airway management.Retrospective review of electronic anesthesia database.University hospital.The electronic charts of 10 pediatric patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) who received treatment at our institution from 2005 to 2007 were reviewed with a focus on diagnosis, level of lesion, comorbid diseases, age, procedure, history of perioperative difficulties, and airway management during general anesthesia.A total of 10 pediatric patients, 6 girls and 4 boys, underwent 11 procedures from 2005 to 2007. Average age was 11 (range, 4-16 yrs). Six patients were ASA physical status II and 4 were ASA physical status III. Four patients had spinal fusion, 6 underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and one patient underwent removal of halo hardware. Eight patients had undergone previous surgeries of the 8, one patient had a history of difficult intubation. Six patients underwent tracheal intubations, 4 had a Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMAThe airways of individuals with KFS may be successfully managed in a variety of ways, often with little degree of difficulty.
