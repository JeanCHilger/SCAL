Central hypoventilation syndrome after Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis and herpes infection. A case of central hypoventilation syndrome was identified in a child with brainstem and cervical cord injury following Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis and extensive herpes simplex infection. This process resulted in a spastic tetraplegia, and the child continues to require respiratory support. Possible mechanisms of causation are discussed including an evolving, progressive inflammatory or vasculitic process in the setting of transient immunosuppression.
