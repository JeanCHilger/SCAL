Case report 691. Radiation-induced osteochondromas (RIO) arising from the neural arch and producing compression of the spinal cord. A case of a 16-year-old girl with a RIO of the T11 neural arch compressing the spinal cord is presented. The radiation therapy had been given after removal of a Wilms' tumor at 1 year of age. RIOs usually occur in the long bones and are diagnosed about 8 years following irradiation. Spinal cord or nerve root compression is usually associated with multiple cartilaginous exostoses.
