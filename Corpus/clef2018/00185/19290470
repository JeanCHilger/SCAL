Osteochondromas of the cervical spine in atypical location. In the current article we review the available English literature by pubmed search engine on the topic of osteochondromas and their location in the cervical spine. The focus is to investigate the location of the lesions in cervical spine and to analyze clinical presentations and symptoms of patients, the aetiology and histopathology examination of the masses. In addition we report a rare illustrative case of a 62 year-old man with an osteochondroma of the cervical spine. The mass developed at a very slow rate for many years and produced no clinical symptoms. The location of the extradural mass in the right atlanto-axial joint of C1 and C2 is extremely rare and was not been reported so far. After preoperative CT- and MRI-imaging the entire mass could be removed.
