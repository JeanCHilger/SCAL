The longitudinal sagittal growth changes of maxilla and mandible according to quantitative cervical vertebral maturation. To investigate the longitudinal sagittal growth changes of maxilla and mandible according to the quantitative cervical vertebral maturation (QCVM) for adolescents with normal occlusion, mixed longitudinal data were used. The samples included 87 adolescents aged from 8 to 18 y old with normal occlusion (32 males, 55 females) selected from 901 candidates. Sequential lateral cephalograms and hand-wrist films were taken once a year, lasting for 6 y. The longitudinal sagittal growth changes of maxilla and mandible according to QCVM were measured. There were some significant differences between maxilla and mandible according to QCVM. The sagittal growth change of maxilla showed a trend towards high velocity-->decelerating velocity-->completing velocity from QCVM stage I to stage IV. The sagittal growth change of mandible showed a trend towards accelerating velocity-->high velocity-->decelerating velocity-->completing velocity from QCVM stage I to stage IV. With sagittal relationship, growth magnitude was almost the same between maxilla and mandible at QCVM stage I. At stage II the growth of mandible exceeded that of maxilla and growth in mandible continued at stages III and IV, while the maxilla ceased to grow. Growth magnitude was greater and the growth duration was longer with male mandible. It is concluded that the longitudinal sagittal growth changes of maxilla and mandible on the basis of QCVM is of value in the orthodontic practice.
