Spinal osteoblastoma complicated with epidural hematoma: two case reports. Case report.To describe 2 patients of spinal osteoblastoma in upper thoracic lamina, complicated with epidural hematoma and symptoms of cord compression.Review the clinical presentation, radiologic findings, and treatment in these 2 cases, with an emphasis on surgical management and outcomes.Two patients initially presented with symptoms of incomplete neurological deficit after mild injury. Computer tomography scan indicated osteolytic destruction of thoracic lamina magnetic resonance imaging illustrated that lesion in the posterior element of thoracic spine with epidural hematoma and sign of spinal cord compression. Marginal surgical resection and hematoma evacuation were performed.Histologic diagnosis indicated destructive osteoblastomas with hemorrhage. Complete neurologic recovery was achieved at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Both patients had no evidence of tumor recurrence at an average follow-up of 37 months.By using surgical resection and hematoma evacuation, good outcome could be achieved for spinal osteoblastoma complicated with epidural hematoma.
