Risk factors for mortality in traumatic cervical spinal cord injury: Brazilian data. Predictive factors for mortality are different among countries knowledge of risk factors is important for planning strategies to reduce mortality in trauma. The objective of this study was to identify predictors of death in traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (TSCI) in Brazil.From 2001 to 2005, 84 patients with clinically detectable TSCI were identified in this retrospective study. For each patient, neurologic and associated injuries, physiologic variables, complications, treatment, and hospital mortality were recorded. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to identify predictors of mortality.Twenty-two (26.2%) patients died in hospital. Car crash (39%) and falls (37.85) were the most frequent causes of trauma. The causes of death were as follows: neurologic, 8 (36.4%) respiratory, 4 (18.2%)GCS score <9, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use were predictors of mortality with TCSI, and if these risk factors were absent, we observed low mortality rate.
