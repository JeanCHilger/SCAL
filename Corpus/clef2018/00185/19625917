Spinal intradural extramedullary hydatidosis: report of three cases. Spinal hydatid cyst is a serious form of hydatid disease affecting fewer than 1% of all patients with hydatid disease. We report 3 healthy patients who presented with progressive paraparesis attributed to a histologically proven intradural hydatid cyst.There were 2 children (1 boy, 1 girl) and 1 adult with a mean age of 12 years. The median follow-up duration was 16 months. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging was performed in the 3 patients, and an anatomic and topographical diagnosis of the intradural hydatid cyst was made.Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed cystic lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement. Surgery was performed through laminectomy, complete resection was achieved, and antihelminthic treatment with albendazole 10 mg/kg-1 per day for 6 months was included in the postoperative treatment. The patients improved after surgery with normal motor function.This localization is rare and serious, but its prognosis is excellent if diagnosis is made early enough and surgery is performed in time to prevent cyst rupture.
