Long-term functional outcome after type A3 spinal fractures: operative versus non-operative treatment. The authors retrospectively studied, by questionnaires, the long-term (5 years) functional outcome after operative (posterior instrumentation: 38 cases) and non-operative treatment (25 cases) for type A3 spinal fractures (Comprehensive Classification) without neurological deficit. A possible bias of this study was the fact that the operative group included 60% A3.2 and A3.3 fractures, versus only 12% in the nonoperative group. Two disease-specific questionnaires were used: the Visual Analogue Scale Spine Score and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. At follow-up the mean VAS scores were 82.6 and 80.8 in the operatively and non-operatively treated group, respectively the difference was not significant. The mean RMDQ scores were 3.3 and 3.1 in the operatively and non-operatively treated groups, respectively
