Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with extradural spinal cord compression: functional outcome and survival. Between 1971 and 1988, 20 patients with previously undiagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), of intermediate or high grade histology presented with extradural spinal cord compression. All had decompressive surgery. The first treatment after surgery was chemotherapy in nine and radiotherapy in 11 patients. At presentation 15% were ambulant and this improved to 55% after surgery urinary continence improved from 30 to 80%. Mobility and sphincter control remained unchanged, regardless of subsequent therapy. Chemotherapy as the initial treatment modality after surgery, either alone or in combination with radiotherapy, did not jeopardise functional outcome. Mobility after surgery was an independent prognostic factor for survival, when corrected for age and stage at presentation (P = 0.04). The treatment of intermediate and high grade NHL presenting with spinal cord compression should be based on histology, extent of disease and age, as with other sites of presentation, but should also take into consideration the prognostic importance of post-surgical mobility.
