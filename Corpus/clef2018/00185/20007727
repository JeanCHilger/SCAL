A novel association between RASA1 mutations and spinal arteriovenous anomalies. CM-AVM is a recently recognized autosomal dominant disorder associated with mutations in RASA1. Arteriovenous lesions have been reported in the brain, limbs, and the face in 18.5% of patients. We report a novel association between RASA1 mutations and spinal arteriovenous anomalies.In a collaborative study, 5 index patients (2 females, 3 males) with spinal AVMs or AVFs and cutaneous multifocal capillary lesions were investigated for the RASA1 gene mutation.All 5 patients were found to have RASA1 mutation (2 de novo, 3 familial), and all had multifocal capillary malformations at birth. Neurologic deficits developed at ages ranging from infancy to early adulthood. All spinal anomalies (2 AVMs at the conus, 1 AVM at the lumbosacral junction, and 1 cervical and 1 cervicothoracic AVF) were complex, extensive, and fast-flow lesions. All patients required treatment based on the clinical and/or radiologic appearance of the lesions.To our knowledge, an association of RASA1 mutation and spinal AVM/AVF has not been described. MR imaging screening of patients with characteristic CMs and neurologic symptoms presenting at a young age may be useful in detecting the presence of fast-flow intracranial or intraspinal arteriovenous anomalies before potentially significant neurologic insult has occurred.
