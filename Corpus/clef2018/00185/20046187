Back pain and vertebral compression: an unusual presentation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Junayet, a nine years and six months old boy was admitted to the hospital because of back pain and vertebral compression fractures. The boy had been well until two months earlier, when he began to have back pain after falling on his back along with occasional fever. The pain was intermittent initially but gradually it became constant. One month before admission, he fell again and the back pain became deteriorated. He was mildly pale, liver was palpable, skin survey revealed normal, BCG scar mark was present. He had bone pain, cervical lymphadenopathy and a tender swelling on the lumbusacral region. Two weeks before admission, the hematological findings were suggestive of leukemia of lymphoblastic type. Biochemical values were normal except high level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was free of malignant cell. Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia of the thoracic and lumber spine with multiple compression fracture of the vertebral bodies of D7, D8, D12 and L1, L3 and L5 with increased disc space. Radiograph of the chest also showed diffuse osteopenia of ribs. Magnetic resonance (MRI) showed uniform signal intensity in the marrow throughout the spine with compressed fracture of the same vertebrae. Bone marrow morphology study and the cytochemistry of the aspirated marrow were consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L2). Then, he was started protocol based chemotherapy for induction of remission, consolidation, high dose methotrexate and maintenance therapy. Now, he is on regular follow up with repeated hematological and radiological examinations. Following six month of chemotherapy the boy was found with significant improvement of his physical, hematological and radiological abnormalities.
