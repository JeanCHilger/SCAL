Involvement of the oral cavity in a carotid pseudoaneurysm of an adolescent treated by an endovascular procedure. Pseudoaneurysms of the internal carotid artery are uncommon and normally secondary to trauma of the cervical region. Frequently it is the throat and neck doctor who evaluates these patients. We report on the case of a 15-year-old patient with active bleeding via the oral cavity, headache, and later hematoma in the cervical region. Arteriography demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Angiography demonstrated successful embolization after the placement of coils and thus endovascular procedures are an alternative treatment for pseudoaneurysms of the internal carotid arteries in adolescents.
