Evaluation by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of trabecular bone quality in mandible and cervical vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to make a comparison between mandibular and cervical vertebral bone quality (BQ) using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The cervical MRI images included in this study belonged to 36 patients (23 women, 13 men mean age 54 years) who had various clinical symptoms (e.g., headache, vertigo, imbalance). The mandible and cervical vertebrae BQ measurements were performed by the same investigator on these sections. Mandibular and cervical vertebral T2(*) axial cross sections were performed following receipt of consent from each patient. T2(*) relaxation time values were determined in the trabecular area.The relationship between cervical vertebral and mandibular BQ was revealed by regression and correlation analysis. The correlation coefficient was r=0.04, r(2)=0.002, and P=0.818, which is not statistically significant. The relation between age and mandible BQ was very weak (r=0.001, r(2)=0.000001, and P=0.995), and the relation between age and cervical vertebrae BQ was correlated (r=-0.585, r(2)=0.342, and P<0.001).There is a low correlation between the BQ measurements of cervical vertebrae and the mandible. Precise mandibular BQ measurement does not provide information that correlates with BQ in the other sites of the skeleton. Although an age-dependent decrease occurs in vertebral BQ, no significant alteration occurs in mandibular BQ.
