A penetrating neck injury: trivial trauma with serious consequences. Life-threatening complications due to apparently minor penetrating neck injuries can occur. We present the case of a 16-year-old boy, who had what initially appeared to be a superficial stab wound to his neck. After further evaluation, he was found to have major injuries to his larynx and esophagus. This case underscores the importance of a careful evaluation after any penetrating neck injury, even one that initially appears to be trivial. The pertinent literature regarding penetrating neck trauma is reviewed.
