Long-term outcome of division of the C8 nerve root for spasticity of the hand in cerebral palsy. Division of the C8 nerve root results in short-term relief of spasticity in the hands of cerebral palsy patients. In the present study, we assessed the long-term outcome of C8 nerve root division. Between March 1997 and January 2002, this procedure was done in 13 patients. All received consistent postoperative functional rehabilitation training. The hands were assessed before operation and at follow-up using the Lazareff grading system. The average follow-up time was 8.6 years. Two hands showed excellent improvement, three limbs showed good improvement and eight hands showed no improvement. No long-term complications occurred in any patient. These results indicate that the long-term outcome of C8 nerve root rhizotomy for the treatment of hand spasticity in CP is generally poor.
