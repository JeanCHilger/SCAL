Anomaly of cervical vertebrae found on orthodontic examination: 8-year-old boy with cleft lip and palate diagnosed with Klippel-Feil syndrome. We incidentally encountered an anomaly of the cervical vertebrae during orthodontic examination of an 8-year-old boy with cleft lip and palate. Klippel-Feil syndrome was diagnosed by the orthopedic specialist to whom he had been referred for detailed examination. This case report shows the results of axial multislice-helical computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstructions of the cervical vertebrae. Furthermore, we evaluated the frequency of congenital anomalies on lateral cephalogram in patients with cleft lip and palate or cleft palate and non-cleft controls from among all patients in our orthodontic clinic.
