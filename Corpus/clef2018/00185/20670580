Anatomic and radiological study on posterior pedicle screw fixation in the atlantoaxial vertebrae of children. To investigate the feasibility of posterior fixation with 3.5-mm pedicle screws in the atlantoaxial vertebrae of children.In this study, atlantoaxial vertebrae specimens were obtained from 10 cadavers of children aged 6-8 years. We measured the height and width of the C(1) pedicle and the midportion of C(1) lateral mass the width of C(1) posterior arch under the vertebral artery groove and the height of the external and internal one-third of this partFor the cadaveric specimen group, the height and width of the C1 pedicle were (5.26+/-0.44) mm and (6.26+/-0.75) mm respectively. The height of the medial one-third of the C1 posterior arch under the vertebral artery groove was (4.07+/-0.24) mm. The external, internal height and superior, middle, inferior width of the C2 pedicle was (6.86+/-0.48) mm, (6.67+/-0.49) mm, (6.63+/-0.61) mm, (5.41+/-0.39) mm and (3.71+/-0.30) mm, respectively. For the volunteer group measured by CT scan, the height and width of the C(1) pedicle were (5.47+/-0.34) mm and (6.63+/-0.54) mm respectively, while (6.59+/-0.51) mm and (5.13+/-0.42) mm of the C2 pedicle. The angles between the atlas, axis pedicles and the midsagittal plane were (9.60+/-1.32) degree and (27.80+/-2.22) degree respectively.It is feasible to place a 3.5-mm pedicle screw in the C(1) and C(2) pedicles of children aged 6-8 years old.
