Prognostic factors for the effect of a myofeedback-based teletreatment service. We investigated the potential prognostic factors for clinically relevant improvements in pain intensity and pain-related disability after myofeedback-based teletreatment. Sixty-five female computer users, 56 female patients with whiplash-associated disorders and 18 female patients with non-specific neck and shoulder pain participated in the study. They received myofeedback-based teletreatment or usual treatment. Questionnaires concerning prognostic factors, pain and disability were completed before the start of the intervention (baseline) and at follow-ups at the end of the intervention, and after 3 and 6 months. Logistic regression analyses were performed in order to investigate prognostic factors for clinically relevant improvement. In the intervention group, improvement in pain intensity was predicted by baseline pain intensity. Baseline pain intensity and disability, and fear-avoidance and endurance related pain coping responses were prognostic factors for outcome in pain-related disability in this group. There were few differences between the intervention groups fear-avoidance coping responses influenced the outcome after teletreatment only. Myofeedback-based teletreatment appears to be an useful telemedicine intervention, especially for participants with moderate to high levels of pain and disability, high perceived help/hopelessness, and those who tend to deal with their pain by avoiding social and physical activities.
