Integration of parts in the facial skeleton and cervical vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to undertake an exploratory analysis of the relationship among parts in the facial skeleton and cervical vertebrae and their integration as 2-dimensional shapes by determining their individual variations and covariations. The study was motivated by considerations applicable to clinical orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery, in which such relationships bear directly on pretreatment analysis and assessment of posttreatment outcome.Lateral radiographs of 61 adolescents of both sexes without major malocclusions were digitized and marked up by using continuous outline spline curves for 8 defined parts in the facial skeleton, including the cervical vertebrae. Individual part variation was analyzed by using principal components analysis, and paired part covariation was analyzed by using 2-block partial least squares analysis in 2 modes: relative size, position, and shape and shape only.For individual part variations, cranial base, soft-tissue profile, and mandible had the largest variations across the sample. For covariation of relative size, position, and shape, the cervical vertebrae were highly correlated with the cranial base (r = 0.80), nasomaxillary complex (r = 0.70), mandible (r = 0.74), maxillary dentition (r = 0.70), and mandibular dentition (r = 0.74) the maxillary dentition and mandibular dentition were highly correlated (r = 0.70)We found that integration of the shape of parts in the facial skeleton and cervical vertebrae is weak it is the relative size, position, and orientation of parts that form the strongest correlations.
