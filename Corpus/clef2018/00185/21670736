Mission impossible? Urological management of patients with spinal cord injury during pregnancy: a systematic review. A systematic literature review.To systematically assess the existing knowledge about treatment of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) in pregnant women with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), as urologic management of these patients is mandatory, but no guidelines are available.Paraplegic center in Switzerland.Studies were identified by electronic search of PubMed and MedLine. Data were pooled and analyzed quantitatively.The evidence level of all 14 reports (163 patients, 226 pregnancies) included was low. In 13 studies, information was gathered by a retrospective review of the medical records or by questionnaires. In all studies, reported data were incomplete. SCI was cervical in 34.7%, thoracic in 61.2% and lumbar in 4.1% of the pregnant women. In all 34.7% of the women used indwelling catheters, 25% performed intermittent catheterization, 11.5% used the Credé maneuver and 28.8% voided spontaneously. A total of 64% of the patients had at least one symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy. UTIs were more common in women with indwelling catheters (100%) than in those performing intermittent catheterization (38.5%), using the Credé technique (17%) or voiding spontaneously (53.3%). One study demonstrated a significant reduction in UTI during pregnancy without complications in mothers or infants.No evidence-based recommendations can be drawn from the existing literature to guide urologists in the management of NLUTD in pregnant women with SCI. The number of studies is small, and data acquisition and presentation are often inadequate. Thus, further research is urgently needed.
