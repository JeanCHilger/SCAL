Critical study of 200 surgically treated lumbar disk hernias. The authors reviewed 200 cases of operated lumbar disk hernias. Hernias of the L4-L5 disk were twice as frequent as those of the L5-S1 disk. When clinical examination revealed simultaneous involvement of the L5 and S1 nerve roots, the L4-L5 disk was more frequently responsible (75%). Clinical examination alone was not sufficient to localize the level of the disk hernia and CT scan used for this purpose had a sensitivity of 93.2%. In 20% of cases, the CT scan demonstrated a second asymptomatic lesion. The results of surgical treatment were assessed as 83% good and very good results and 50% complete cures. The authors propose the following recommendations: Look for involvement of the L5 and S1 nerve roots which is suggestive of an L4-L5 hernia only operate after radiological demonstration of the level of the herniated disk
