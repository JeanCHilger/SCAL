Cervical spinal stenosis with cord neurapraxia and transient quadriplegia. The purpose of this article is to define as a distinct clinical entity, the syndrome of cervical spinal cord neurapraxia with transient quadriplegia. Sensory changes include burning pain, numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation, whereas motor changes consist of weakness or complete paralysis. The phenomenon of cervical spinal cord neurapraxia occurs in individuals with (1) developmental cervical spinal stenosis, (2) congenital fusions, (3) cervical instability, or (4) intervertebral disc protrusions when associated with a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal. There is no evidence that the occurrence of cervical spinal cord neurapraxia predisposes an individual to permanent neurologic injury. However, patients with this syndrome and associated with cervical spine instability or acute or chronic degenerative changes should be precluded from further participation in contact sports. Those with developmental spinal stenosis or spinal stenosis associated with congenital abnormalities should be treated on an individual basis.
