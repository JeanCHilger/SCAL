Analysis of concurrent intravertebral vacuum sign in thoracolumbar fractures after posterior internal fixation. To investigate the importance of TLICS classification to surgical options of thoracolumbar fractures by analyzing the cause of intravertebral vacuum sign, vertebral collapse and vertebral pseudarthrosis.From January 2006 to December 2010, the clinical data about 15 patients with postoperative complications by thoracolumbar fracture after posterior internal fixation were retrospectively analyzed. There were 9 males and 6 females, ranging in age from 18 to 75 years, with an average of 54.6 years. Of them, fracture site in T12 was 7 cases, L1 was 5 cases, L2 was 3 cases compression fractures was in 12 cases and burst fracture was in 3 casesAfter 10 to 20 months following-up (with average of 15 months), loss of vertebral height found in 9 cases (4 cases existed vertebral collapse, as well as 3 cases occurred screw loosening) and Intravertebral Vacuum Sign appeared in 6 cases.In order to avoid the vertebral vacuum and fixation failure, the clinical data of patients should be roundly and carefully evaluated, surgical indications should be strictly controlled and the surgical approach should be selected according to correct classification. Particularly, the reconstruction of the stability of former spinal column shoud be paid more attention.
