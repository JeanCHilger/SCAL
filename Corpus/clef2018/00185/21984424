Injuries to the upper cervical medulla in severe brain injuries. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 250 patients who had been unconscious post-trauma for at least 24 hours. The frequency and the characteristics of injuries to the upper cervical myelon were determined.Between 1996 and 2009, MRI was carried out within 8 days of trauma.No lesions of the upper cervical medulla were found without accompanying damage to the medulla oblongata. Two groups were found to have a lesion in the upper cervical myelon. (i) In 3.2 % of the patients in a state of deep coma MRI revealed lesions in the entire brain stem. These died without waking from coma. (ii) 2 % of the patients were found to have additional damage to the distal medulla oblongata. These victims of high-speed traumas awoke from coma after 2-3 days. They revealed frontal contusions of the brain and traumatic subarachnoidal hemorrhages. Injuries to the bony upper cervical spine and/or the skull base were frequent. Four of them died, one patient survived with severe disabilities.Two types of lesions involving the upper cervical myelon could be differentiated, both of which occur only in association with lesions in the medulla oblongata.
