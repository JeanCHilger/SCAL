The imaging and management of nonconsecutive pars interarticularis defects: a case report and review of literature. Lumbar spondylolysis is a well-recognized condition occurring in adolescents because of repetitive overuse in sports. Multiple-level spondylolysis involving consecutive lower lumbar segments are rare. Several authors have reported failure of conservative treatment in the management of multiple-level pars fractures.A case report and review of previous literature is presented.The objectives of this case report were to present a rare case of pars fracture involving nonconsecutive segments and discuss image findings and treatment.The patent's history, clinical examination, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and treatment are reported. We also discuss the pathogenesis, various treatment options, and review the literature.We present the fourth case of bilateral pars fractures involving nonconsecutive lower lumbar spine segments of L3 and L5, in a 16-year-old young adolescent footballer who presented with 4-month history of constant low back pain. After 1 year of conservative management, the more acute fractures at L3 showed complete bony union, symptomatic pain relief, and return to full sporting activity.We report a rare case of bilateral pars fractures involving nonconsecutive segments. Multiplane reconstruction of CT images and MRI are very useful in planning treatment and follow-up. Conservative management may be used to treat multilevel nonconsecutive pars fractures.
