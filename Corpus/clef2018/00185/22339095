The biomechanical and functional relationship between temporomandibular dysfunction and cervical spine pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of TMD on spinal pain and to check whether TMD therapy helps to cure spinal pain. The total number of 44 evaluated patients underwent physical examination of masticatory motor system, including an evaluation of TMJ function with a Zebris JMA device and an analysis of the cervical spine motion using a Zebris MCS device. Patients from the treated (tested) group, who were diagnosed with TMD, were treated with an occlusal splint. Subsequent examinations were planned 3 weeks and 3 months after the treatment. The results show that there is a close correlation between TMD and spinal pain. The results of the tests performed 3 months after the beginning of occlusal splint therapy show a significant improvement in TMJ function as well as a reduction in spinal pain, as general motor parameters of spinal movements improved.
