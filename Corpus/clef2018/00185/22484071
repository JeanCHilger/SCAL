Hangman's fracture in an osteogenesis imperfecta patient. Traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis, also known as a hangman's fracture, is a well-described entity but is relatively uncommon. There are only two published reports of these fractures occurring in pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, a disorder that predisposes patients to long bone fractures.We present a unique case of an adult woman with osteogenesis imperfecta who sustained an Effendi type II hangman's fracture.Effendi type II fractures can be conservatively managed via rigid or nonrigid cervical orthosis.
