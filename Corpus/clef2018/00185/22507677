Long-term outcome of olfactory ensheathing cell therapy for patients with complete chronic spinal cord injury. The neurorestorative effect of the parenchymal transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) for cord trauma remains clinically controversial. The aim of this article is to study the long-term result of OECs for patients with complete chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). One hundred  and eight patients suffered from complete chronic SCI were followed up successfully within the period of 3.47 ± 1.12 years after OEC therapy. They were divided into two groups based on the quality and quantity of their rehabilitative training: group A (n = 79) in sufficient rehabilitation  (or active movement-target enhancement-neurorehabilitation therapy, AMTENT) and group B (n = 29) in insufficient rehabilitation. All patients were assessed by using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standard and the International Association of Neurorestoratology Spinal  Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIFRS). Thirty-one patients were evaluated by the tests of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG), and paravertebral sensory evoked potential (PVSEP). We found the following. 1) According to ASIA and IANR-SCIFRS assessment for all  108 patients, averaged motor scores increased from 37.79 ± 18.45 to 41.25 ± 18.18 (p < 0.01), light touch scores from 50.32 ± 24.71 to 55.90 ± 24.46 (p < 0.01), pin prick scores from 50.53 ± 24.92 to 54.53 ± 24.62 (p <  0.01) IANR-SCIFRS scores increased from 19.32 ± 9.98 to 23.12 ± 10.30 (p < 0.01). 2) The score changes in terms of motor, light touch, pin prick, and IANR-SCIFRS in group A were remarkably different (all p < 0.01). The score changes in group B were remarkably  different in terms of motor (p < 0.05) and IANR-SCIFRS (p < 0.01), but not light touch or pin prick (p > 0.05). 3) Comparing group A with group B, the increased scores in terms of motor, light touch, and pin prick were remarkably different (all p < 0.01),  but not IANR-SCIFRS (p > 0.05). 4) Fourteen of 108 patients (12.96%) became ASIA B from ASIA A
