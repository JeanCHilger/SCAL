Pediatric spinal cord injury. Although the incidence of spinal cord injury in childhood is lower than in adults, the impact is significant when the number of years with resulting severe limitations are considered. Prevention is the key to spinal cord management in all age groups, but takes on a stronger, more emphasized sense of urgency with children. If methods of prevention fail, successful early management of a child with spinal cord injury is the best hope for a future filled with accomplishments.
