Complications of occipital screw placement for occipitocervical fusion in children. Occipitocervical stabilization in the pediatric age group remains a challenge because of the regional anatomy, poor occipital bone purchase, and, in some instances, significant thinning of the occipital bone. Multiple bicortical fixation points to the occipital bone may be required to increase construct rigidity. The authors evaluated the complications of bicortical occipital screw placement in children with occipital fusion constructs.The records of 20 consecutive pediatric patients who had undergone occipitocervical fusion between September 1, 2007, and November 30, 2010, at Texas Children's Hospital were reviewed.The patients consisted of 10 girls and 10 boys, ranging in age from 10 months to 16 years (mean ± SD, 7.7 ± 5.1 years). Two patients were lost to follow-up, 2 died for reasons unrelated to the surgery, and the remaining patients had at least 3 months of follow-up (mean 14 ± 11.8 months) with evaluation via dynamic radiography and CT. Four patients experienced 8 complications: 2 CSF leaks, 2 vigorous venous bleedings, worsening of quadriparesis, wound infection, radiographic pseudarthrosis, and transient dysphagia. Among 114 screws, there were 2 cases of intraoperative dural venous sinus injury and 2 cases of intraoperative CSF leakage, without clinical sequelae from these complications. Only 1 case of radiographic pseudarthrosis was identified in a patient with skeletal dysplasia and a prior failed C1-2 posterior arthrodesis. There were no difficulties with wound healing because of prominent occipital instrumentation, and there was only 1 wound infection.Data in this report confirm that including bicortical occipital screw placement in occipitocervical constructs in children may result in a high fusion rate but at the cost of a notable complication rate.
