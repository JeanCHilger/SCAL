Clinical trial of a method for confirming the effects of spinal anesthesia in patients with spinal cord injury. In this case series study, we prospectively examined whether it might be possible to check the effect of spinal anesthesia (SA), based on the disappearance of lower extremity reflexes and spasticity, in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), in whom the effect cannot be confirmed by the pinprick test or by using the Bromage scale. In 40 patients with chronic, clinically complete cervical SCI who were scheduled to receive SA, pre-anesthetic examination revealed that the Babinski sign, patellar tendon reflex, and spasticity (assessed using the Ashworth scale) were all positive in 31 patients, while two of these three pre-anesthetic assessment parameters were positive in eight patients. The effect of SA in these 39 patients (97.5Â %) was confirmed by demonstrating the absence of both the Babinski sign and patellar tendon reflex and loss of spasticity after SA. Our results suggested that the effect of SA can be confirmed by the disappearance of the Babinski sign and patellar tendon reflex and loss of spasticity in most patients with complete cervical SCI, although determination of the level of the block is difficult. In conclusion, loss of the Babinski sign, patellar tendon reflex, and spasticity might be useful for checking the effect of SA in cervical SCI patients.
