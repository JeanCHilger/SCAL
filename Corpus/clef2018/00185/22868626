Single-level calcified cervical disk herniation in a 13-year-old girl. This article describes a case of a 13-year-old girl with single-level calcified cervical disk herniation. The patient was treated conservatively for a symptomatic intervertebral calcification that caused neurological compression, and the data were reviewed retrospectively. Previous reports have shown that the natural history of the disease is self-limiting with a benign course and an excellent prognosis. However, on rare occasions when the calcified nucleus pulposus herniates into the spinal canal and compresses the spinal cord or its roots, neurological abnormalities can occur, such as radiculopathy and myelopathy. This also raises the question of whether operative therapy will eventually be necessary. In the current case, conservative treatment was applied. Plain radiographs are usually sufficient to determine the presence and extent of a calcified cervical disk, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can detect an associated disk herniation. Conservative treatment with antalgics, muscle relaxants, neurotrophic drugs, and a cervical collar were applied. The patient was completely free of symptoms 3 weeks after the initial treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated complete vertebral canal clearance at final follow-up. Cervical intervertebral disk calcification and herniation is a rare disorder in children with an obscure etiology but a good prognosis. Conservative therapy produces satisfactory results, even if clinical symptoms due to nerve root or spinal cord compression are present. Surgical treatments are only suitable in rare cases with severe progressive radicular pain or neurological deficit.
