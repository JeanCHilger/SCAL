Heterotopic ossification of the shoulder after central nervous system lesion: indications for surgery and results. Heterotopic ossification (HO) of the shoulder after central nervous system damage has seldom been studied.We performed a single-center retrospective study from 1993 to 2009 including patients who underwent surgery for troublesome shoulder HO. Demographic data, HO location, surgical approach, preoperative and postoperative shoulder range of motion, etiologies, and postoperative complications were collected from patients' files.We found 19 shoulder HOs in 16 patients (traumatic brain injury in 11, spinal cord injury in 2, stroke in 1, and cerebral anoxia in 2). The data in 2 files were incomplete and were therefore not used. HO locations around the joint were anteroinferomedial in 4 (21.1%), posteroinferomedial in 5 (26.3%), encircling in 3 (15.8%), superior in 1 (5.3%), and mixed (2 associated HOs that are not encircling) in 6 (31.6%). The surgical approaches were as follows: deltopectoral, 5 (26.3%) Neer, 3 (15.8%)Anatomic relations with nerves and vessels, as well as limited range of motion, require a case-by-case surgical approach, a preoperative scan (looking for a gutter), and sometimes, electromyography. Surgical indications depend on the degree of loss of function or hygiene, control of comorbid factors, and discussion with the patient and his or her family.
