Feasibility of rehabilitation training with a newly developed wearable robot for patients with limited mobility. To investigate the feasibility of rehabilitation training with a new wearable robot.Before-after clinical intervention.University hospital and private rehabilitation facilities.A convenience sample of patients (N=38) with limited mobility. The underlying diseases were stroke (n=12), spinal cord injuries (n=8), musculoskeletal diseases (n=4), and other diseases (n=14).The patients received 90-minute training with a wearable robot twice per week for 8 weeks (16 sessions).Functional ambulation was assessed with the 10-m walk test (10MWT) and the Timed Up & Go (TUG) test, and balance ability was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Both assessments were performed at baseline and after rehabilitation.Thirty-two patients completed 16 sessions of training with the wearable robot. The results of the 10MWT included significant improvements in gait speed, number of steps, and cadence. Although improvements were observed, as measured with the TUG test and BBS, the results were not statistically significant. No serious adverse events were observed during the training.Eight weeks of rehabilitative training with the wearable robot (16 sessions of 90min) could be performed safely and effectively, even many years after the subjects received their diagnosis.
