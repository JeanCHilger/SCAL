Navigation-assisted Le Fort I osteotomy with midpalatal split to treat compressive pathologies of the craniovertebral junction. This report describes the management of the case of an 11-year-old girl with serious compressive pathology of the craniocervical junction using a navigation-guided Le Fort I level maxillotomy and midline split. In this pediatric case, image guidance significantly enhanced intraoperative orientation and helped to determine the correct location of the horizontal osteotomy lines at the Le Fort I level.
