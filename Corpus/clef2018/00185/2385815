The role of desmopressin in reducing blood loss during lumbar fusions. The effectiveness of desmopressin (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) in reducing intraoperative blood loss during lumbar fusions was investigated in 42 patients (52 operations) and compared with a control group of 55 patients (63 operations). The mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels on admission and discharge were identical for both groups. Patients receiving desmopressin required less than one-half the number of autologous transfusions than the control group. Desmopressin was effective in reducing blood loss in operations in which intraoperative bleeding was greater than 1,000 milliliters, but it is probably not necessary for anticipated losses less than this amount. It may have a role in operations performed on short notice when autologous blood is usually unavailable.
