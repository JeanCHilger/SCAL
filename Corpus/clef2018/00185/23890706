Technique for reduction and percutaneous fixation of U- and H-shaped sacral fractures. We describe an early reduction and percutaneous fixation technique for isolated sacral fractures. Strong manual traction combined with manual counter-traction on the torso is used to disimpact the fracture. Transcondylar traction is then applied bilaterally and two ilio-sacral screws are inserted percutaneously on each side. Open reduction and fixation, with sacral laminectomy in patients with neurological abnormalities, remains the reference standard. Early reduction and percutaneous fixation ensures restoration of the pelvic parameters while minimising soft-tissue damage and the risk of infection. Decompression procedures can be performed either during the same surgical procedure after changing the installation or after a few days. These complex fractures warrant patient referral to specialised reference centres.
