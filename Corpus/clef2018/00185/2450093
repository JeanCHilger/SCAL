The anterior retropharyngeal approach to the upper part of the cervical spine. Since 1959, we have used a superior extension of the anterior approach to the cervical spine of Robinson and Smith in a consecutive series of seventeen patients. This approach provided anterior access to the neural elements from the clivus to the body of the third cervical vertebra, without the need for posterior dissection of the carotid sheath or entrance into the hypopharynx or oral cavity. It also provided adequate exposure for the insertion of iliac or fibular strut grafts, which was necessary in thirteen patients. The approach gave excellent exposure for anterior intralesional excision of a tumor in ten patients, marginal excision of an osteochondroma, two corpectomies of the second cervical vertebra combined with removal of the odontoid process, corpectomy of the second cervical vertebra for the treatment of fixed atlanto-axial subluxation, removal of a bullet anterior to the clivus, reduction of a dislocation of the second on the third cervical vertebra secondary to an unstable fracture of the pedicles of the second cervical vertebra, and anterior d√©bridement for treatment of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. In contrast to the reported results of transmucosal approaches to the atlas and axis, there were no infections or iatrogenic neurological deficits of the spine in the present series. Twelve patients who were followed for two years or more had a solid anterior fusion and no subsequent loss of cervical stability. Pain in the neck was relieved in all of the patients who had had a pathological or traumatic fracture.
