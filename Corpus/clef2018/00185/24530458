Traumatic high-grade cervical dislocation: treatment strategies and outcomes. Traumatic high-grade cervical spinal dislocations are rare injuries, generally associated with severe neurological compromise. In particular, cervical spondyloptosis (>100% subluxation) is rarely reported. The object of our study is to present a case series describing presentation, management, and outcome in traumatic high-grade cervical spinal dislocations.Retrospective analysis was performed involving two level 1 trauma centers. Patients with a high-grade traumatic cervical subluxation were selected from a database, and these patients were admitted between August 2007 and July 2011.Fifteen patients were identified three had spondyloptosis. The admission American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade varied (A = 9In this series, 26.7% of patients had improvement in their AIS grade postoperatively, and the majority of patients (60%) maintained their preoperative AIS grade. In 57% of patients placed in traction, reduction was possible. Likely due to the severity of these injuries, there was a high incidence of complications. However, review of patient outcomes reveals that these patients can have improvement of neurological function. We recommend aggressive reduction and surgical stabilization. Our preference is either a combined anterior-posterior approach or a posterior-only approach.
