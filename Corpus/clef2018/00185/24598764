Mediastinal mass causing spinal cord compression. A 4-year-old Cambodian male presented to the emergency room with 2 weeks of gradually increasing leg weakness until he could no longer stand. He was also reported to have a deformity on his back, intermittent fevers and cough. His physical exam was notable for a 2 cm × 1 cm bony protrusion at his T4 vertebrae, and 2/5 strength and positive Babinski reflexes in his lower extremities. A chest x-ray showed a 3.2 cm × 2.9 cm mass in the middle mediastinum extending to the posterior mediastinum. A purified protein derivative test was positive. A computed tomography scan showed findings consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis and a paravertebral mass with amorphous calcifications, which involved destruction of the T4-T5 vertebrae and evidence of cord compression. These findings were all consistent with tuberculous spondylitis (Pott's disease).
