Clinical classification and surgical management of cervicothoracic intraspinal lipomas. To explore the clinical classification and surgical management of cervicothoracic intraspinal lipomas.A total of 22 patients with cervicothoracic intraspinal lipomas were analyzed retrospectively with regards to clinical manifestations, radiographic features, intraoperative findings, surgical techniques and follow-ups.Total (n = 4), subtotal (n = 7) and partial (n = 11) resection was performed. Long-term neurological outcomes were evaluated by modified McCormick classification scheme. Their symptoms improved (n = 15), unchanged (n = 3) and deteriorated (n = 4). And cervicothoracic intraspinal lipomas could be classified into extradural, transitional, chaotic and secondary intramedullary groups.Different groups of cervicothoracic intraspinal lipomas vary in the degree of resection and surgical efficacy. Total resection may be performed on most extradural lipomas. The surgical objective of transitional lipomas is decompression. Chaotic and secondary intramedullary lipomas should target effective resection to avoid neurological function injury. Intraoperative use of laser facilitates tumor resection. Intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring protects spinal cord.
