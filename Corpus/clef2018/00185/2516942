Plate osteosynthesis in femoral shaft fractures. Between 1979 and 1988, 119 children with 123 femur shaft fractures were treated in the Department of Traumatology of the university-hospital of Freiburg. Traffic accidents were the reason in half of the cases. 19 children had multiple trauma and serious cranio-cervical traumata. In the case of 14 further children, additional limb fractures could be diagnosed, four of which were contralateral femur shaft fractures. More than half of the children with femur shaft fractures were treated by internal fixation. Only internal fixation by plate was employed. 32 children were operated upon at the day of the accident (49%). Children with solitary injuries could be treated as outpatients after 13 days. The implanted material could be removed after an average of 8.4 months. At the moment a reexamination of 31 operated cases (altogether 65 children with 69 fractures are operated) is performed. 30 children have excellent (18 patients) or good (12 patients) results. The healing process was complicated by delayed healing of the fracture (1 patient), plate fracture after 2 months (1 patient) and subcutaneous haematoma (2 patients). Osteitis did not occur.
