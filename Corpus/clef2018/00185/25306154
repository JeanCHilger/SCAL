Comparison of the upper airways from cephalometric radiographs of children with and without finger-sucking habit. Finger-sucking in early childhood can induce morphologic changes in the oropharynx and upper airways, which could arise even in children without reported oral breathing. The aim of this study was to compare cephalometric findings in children with and without finger sucking habit with respect to oral breathing.Fifty-six children aged 4 to 12 years (28 with diagnosis of finger sucking and 28 controls) treated at the Port Colombia Dental Clinic underwent cephalometric radiographs, from which morphologic (n=11, whole skull), upper airways (n=10), hyoid bone (n=3) and postural (n=5) measurements were performed. The unpaired t-test was used for comparison between groups.Both groups had similar age and gender distribution (7.9 yrs Â± 2.9 M/F: 14/14). Patients with finger-sucking habit had a higher hard palate length from the anterior nasal spine to the posterior nasal spine (finger-sucking subjects: 50.18 mmFinger-sucking habit is associated with characteristic cephalometric changes even in children without oral breathing, especially at the hyoid bone and postural measurements.
