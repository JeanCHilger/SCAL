Vestibular abnormalities in encephalopathia pugilistica. Vestibulological examination of boxers revealed that 80% had vestibular abnormalities. These were obvious, but well compensated, so that they remained hidden in everyday life and appeared only on laboratory examination or under stress. Regarding the origin of vestibulo-ocular reflex, abnormalities in boxing contribute three etiopathogenetic factors: the first is the direct traumatization of the vestibular apparatus by a direct blow. The second is the diffuse damage of the brain-stem white matter and of vestibular nuclei. The third factor is the traumatization of the cervical spine via the traumatization of the proprioceptive systems, cervical sympathetic and the adjacent vascular mechanisms. One-third of the abnormalities are caused by direct labyrinthine traumatization. The findings of simultaneous EEG, OKN and ETT abnormalities in one-half of our subjects suggests that there are probably also supratentorial lesions caused by the above-mentioned mechanisms.
