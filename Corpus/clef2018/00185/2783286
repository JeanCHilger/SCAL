Superior mediastinal widening from spine fractures mimicking aortic rupture on chest radiographs. Mediastinal widening on chest radiographs associated with lower cervical and upper thoracic spine fractures can mimic the radiographic findings of aortic rupture. Frontal chest radiographs from 54 patients with traumatic fractures of at least one vertebral body from C6 to T8 were examined for signs suggestive of aortic rupture. These signs included (1) mediastinal width equal to or greater than 8 cm (2) presence of a left apical cap
