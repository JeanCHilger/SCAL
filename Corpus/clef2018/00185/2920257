Lack of relationship of conus reflexes to bladder function after spinal cord injury. A series of 20 patients with acute complete suprasacral cord lesions underwent serial urodynamic assessment of vesicourethral function and serial measurement of sacral reflex latency times (SRL) and reflex threshold throughout a follow-up period of 42 to 83 weeks (mean 50). No correlation was found between any pattern of SRL latencies or reflex thresholds and subsequent bladder behaviour. The reproducibility of sacral reflex latencies was found to be poor (mean variation of serial measurements from initial reading 21%) and could not be explained on the basis of "dynamic" neurological recovery. Studies using the bladder as a stimulus site were unreliable. The value of SRL studies in detecting subtle neurophysiological changes is discussed.
