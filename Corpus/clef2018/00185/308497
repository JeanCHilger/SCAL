Vertebral compression syndrome in multiple exostoses (case report). The authors present a case, the second in the world literature, of Spinal Compression Syndrome in Multiple Exostoses. The diagnosis, not revealed on standard radiographs of the vertebral column, was suspected on radiculography and confirmed only by oblique stratigraphic projection. These demonstrated bone formation on the right vertebral lamina of L4 encroaching considerably on the spinal canal. Surgical laminectomy was followed by complete remission of neurological symptoms.
