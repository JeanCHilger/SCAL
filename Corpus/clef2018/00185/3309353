Clearing the cervical spine: initial radiologic evaluation. The identification of unstable cervical spine injury (UCSI) in blunt high-energy transfer injury (BHETI) patients is critical to management. In a prospective study of BHETI patients identified to be at high risk for UCSI, the use of lateral cervical spine view (LCV), three-view cervical spine series (FCS), and limited computerized tomography (CT) in the initial evaluation of these patients was analyzed. Thirteen of 204 patients sustained UCSI. Sensitivity of the LCV alone was 0.85 and the predictive value of the negative test was 0.97. Sensitivity and predictive value of a negative study were maximized by the use of FCS combined with CT when plain X-rays were inadequate. We conclude that technically adequate, normal FCS can be safely used to eliminate the presence of UCSI. If these studies are technically inadequate, the addition of a limited CT can be used to "clear" the spine.
