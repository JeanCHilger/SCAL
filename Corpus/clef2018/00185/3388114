Early clinical experience with the Syracuse I-Plate: an anterior spinal fixation device. Sixteen patients were treated with a new anterior internal fixation device after thoracolumbar or lumbar decompression, and fusion with bone grafting. Ten patients had acute burst fractures, four had metastatic tumors, and two had old, healed fractures with deformity. In the acute fracture group, eight patients had neurologic deficits and seven patients experienced improvement. Six patients had lesions of the conus medullaris, all of which improved. The four patients with metastatic tumors underwent surgery for back and leg pain and all gained significant relief. Two patients had correction of old fracture deformity with satisfactory outcome. Complications were minimal. The new anterior stabilization device provided early stability, allowed early patient mobilization, was easy to insert, and has a low profile. Late collapse, non-union, and kyphotic deformity have not been noted thusfar.
