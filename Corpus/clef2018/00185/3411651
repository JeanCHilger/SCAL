Assessing multiple trauma: is the cervical spine enough? This retrospective study of multiple trauma patients sustaining spinal column fractures was done to assess whether evaluation of the cervical spine alone is adequate. Sixty-three such patients were identified and further descriptive analyses performed. The majority of spinal fractures occurred not in the cervical spine, but in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine areas. Since a number of these spinal fractures have associated neurologic complications, only by prompt evaluation of the entire spinal column can further injuries be prevented. Based on our data, we feel that patients with multiple injuries and an altered sensorium should have the entire spine protected and evaluated radiologically before being cleared.
