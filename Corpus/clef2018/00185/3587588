Syringomyelia and cervical spondylosis: a clinicoradiological investigation. Eighty eight patients with proven syringomyelia have been studied retrospectively to explore the relationship between syringomyelia and spondylotic degeneration of the cervical spine. When compared with age and sex matched control subjects, they showed no significant increase in incidence or severity of spondylosis or of vertebral subluxation. Duration of symptoms, degree of disability, and the pattern of analgesia or lower motor neurone lesions in the arms did not appear to be related to the development of spondylosis. The onset of moderate spondylosis was, however, earlier than in the controls, and individual cases with a remarkably early onset or unusual site and/or severity of spondylosis and subluxation were encountered, particularly following laminectomy. It was also noted that in a small number of patients the concomitant development of spondylosis contributed to clinical deterioration. It is concluded that while syringomyelia does not have a consistent, major role in the development of cervical spondylosis or vertebral luxation, it may contribute to progression of spinal degenerative disease in some patients.
