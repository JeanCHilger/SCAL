Traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis. The lesions of C2 seen in hyperextension injuries of the cervical spine following motor vehicle accidents, diving accidents, and headlong falls resemble the cervical lesion found in judicial hangings. Although the mechanism of injury in these cervical fractures is different, the distinction is significant. The fracture seen in motor vehicular accidents today usually seems to be one of hyperextension and axial compression rather than hyperextension and distraction. This distinction is responsible for the low incidence of neurologic involvement seen in the fracture caused by motor vehicle accidents. The incidence of face and scalp injuries associated with axis pedicle fractures appears significant. Union of this fracture can generally be expected, and it rarely produces late sequelae. Management of this fracture is generally preferable on an ambulatory basis utilizing a cervicothoracic brace or a halo and caudal support in more unstable fractures. A period of 12 weeks of immobilization is recommended for satisfactory union of this fracture. Occasionally the treatment of this fracture may require traction or operative intervention. If operative intervention is required, an anterior route employing interbody fusion is suggested.
