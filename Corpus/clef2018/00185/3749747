Comparison of computer tomography and conventional roentgen diagnosis in benign and malignant bone tumors of the spine. The authors present the results of a performance comparison between CT and conventional x-ray film diagnosis (plain film and tomography) in 93 patients with benign, semimalignant and malignant bone tumours, basing on 124 CT examinations with 176 tumorous bone lesions of the vertebral column. The type, size and incidence rate of the superiority of CT in imaging tumorous bone lesions and its morphologic characterisation, are described.
