Intraspinal spur and scoliosis. An unusual case of scoliosis, associated with an osteocartilaginous spur producing narrowing of the spinal canal, is reported. Routine physical examination and radiography revealed no abnormality apart form an absent left-ankle reflex. The defect was discovered at autopsy following death during operation. In order to discover this rare associated defect in scoliotic patients, myelography is recommended whenever a minor neurological defect is present.
