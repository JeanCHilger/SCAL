MRI in neurosurgical diagnosis and management of craniocervical junction and cervical spine pathology. Thirty-six patients with pathology in the area of the craniocervical junction and the cervical spine have been studied with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), using the Inversion Recovery and Spin-Echo technique. The value of MRI for diagnosis and management is compared, in retrospect, to X-ray Computer Tomography and Myelography. The conclusion is that MRI can replace CT and myelography in the clinical evaluation of many patients with pathology of the craniocervical junction and the cervical spine.
