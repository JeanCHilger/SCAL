Congenital elevation of the scapula and Brown-Sequard syndrome. We describe the case of a 14-year-old boy with a Sprengel deformity and a Brown-SÃ©quard syndrome on the basis of a compression of the spinal cord at level C4. Although there are several publications on anomalies associated with Sprengel's deformity, this is, to our knowledge, the first description of a case with spinal cord compression.
