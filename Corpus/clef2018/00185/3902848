Trans-oral approach to the upper cervical spine. A report of 16 cases. We report 16 cases in which the upper cervical spine was approached through the mouth for operative decompression and stabilisation, with or without removal of diseased tissues. The indications are discussed and the technique is described. Results are compared with those of other reported series. We believe that this operation has a place in the treatment of certain conditions affecting the upper part of the cervical spine and the foramen magnum, with or without involvement of the medulla and spinal cord.
