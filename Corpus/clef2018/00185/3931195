61 years' survival of Koch's bacillus in a closed focus. Disclosure in a case of spinal cord compression caused by sequelae of Pott's disease. A 68 year-old woman presented with a spinal cord compression from an angular kyphosis due to Pott's disease at age 7. Clinical, radiological and pathological studies of the vertebral lesions did not demonstrate an evolutive lesion. However, culture yielded some viable Koch's bacilli. This bacteriologic confirmation 61 years later exemplifies the importance of host immunity reactions, that may prevent the development of KB, and the remarkable capacity of survival of the bacillus.
