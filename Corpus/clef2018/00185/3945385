Spontaneous migration of a bullet in the spinal subarachnoid space causing delayed radicular symptoms. The authors report a case of a gunshot wound to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen in a patient who initially was neurologically intact. The bullet had lodged at the T-11, T-12 level in the spinal canal. After an exploratory laparotomy, the patient developed severe low back pain radiating to his left lower extremity and an incomplete footdrop. Repeat x-ray films and a myelogram showed that the bullet had migrated to the L-4, L-5 level on the left. Bullet emboli and delayed sequelae of gunshot wounds to the spine are discussed.
