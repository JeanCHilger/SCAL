Neck injuries in football players. Understanding neck injuries in football players starts with understanding how the game is played--not the strategy, but the training techniques and requirements of the game. Neck injuries are an unavoidable part of the game. What can be improved are the preventative measures, the treatment techniques, and some standardization of risk factors in playing after a neck injury. Prevention starts with decreasing the use of the head as an offensive weapon and with proper shoulder pads. Treatment begins with proper on-field evaluation and transportation techniques and is completed by good consultation services. Proper evaluation of risk demands open discussions with the patient of all factors involved. Clear advice is given to players and to the team through their medical staff.
