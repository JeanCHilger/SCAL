Development of the spine in school children of Lower Silesia. Following on from earlier investigations, spondylometry was once again carried out in 1572 school-children aged between 7 and 14, using an elastometer. The results were analyzed using the "Wroclaw Taxonomy Method" and are presented in the tables in this paper. They confirm that the individual sections of the spine grow at different rates and that the overall length of the spine increases considerably faster during puberty than body height.
