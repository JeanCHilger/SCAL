Normal movements of the cervical spine. This paper describes a technique for analyzing movement of the cervical spine. The method consists of superimposition of two films representing the cervical spine in the end positions of the movement under investigation (e.g., flexion and extension). From tracings of selected structures, movement is represented in the form of movement diagrams. Knowledge of cervical spine dynamics is helpful in understanding muscle and ligament function as well as the shape of components in various postures.
