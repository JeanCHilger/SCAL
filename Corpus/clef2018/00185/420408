Morphological and functional studies on the odontoid process of the human axis. Studies on the morphology of the odontoid process by various methods strongly suggest a functional adaption of this bony element. With regard to the inclination of the dens axis and the varying position of its articular facets, a modified trabecular system can be observed. Photoelastic experiments confirm that these modifications are correlated with two specific kinds of mechanical stress. The straight odontoid process is only subjected to stress due to compression, but the dorsally inclined dens to bending stress. Based on the morphological and experimental findings, flexion and extension between the first and second vertebrae (in addition to rotation as the principle movement) are discussed.
