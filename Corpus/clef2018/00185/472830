Anesthetic management of neck trauma. In a retrospective review of one year's experience in the management of neck trauma, 88 cases comprising 42 gunshot wounds, 29 stab or slash injuries, and 17 injuries by blunt trauma were reviewed. Multiple injuries were noted in all groups, but a higher percentage was found in the blunt trauma series. Anesthetic management is reviewed, and emphasis is placed on careful evaluation of the patient's airway, using physical and roentgenographic examination to plan adequate airway management.
