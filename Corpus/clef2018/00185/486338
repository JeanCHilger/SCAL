A comparison of predictions from peripheral and central theories of emotion. Peripheral and central theories of emotion differ in the role they ascribe to cognitive and physiological variables in arousal. This study compared the responses of quadriplegics and normal controls to sexually arousing stimuli under various conditions of false heart-rate feedback. The results support a centralist position and the relatively greater importance of cognitive factors in emotional responsiveness.
