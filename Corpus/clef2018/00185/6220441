Bipartite atlas. A case is described of a child aged twelve with rib abnormalities, a Klippel-Feil syndrome and a complete fusion between C2 and C7. The atlas showed abnormal ossification of the anterior and posterior arches. No similar description has been found in the literature. A posterior spine fusion between C1 and C2 was performed.
