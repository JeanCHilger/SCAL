Neck injuries In children. Cervical spine injuries are often overlooked in young children with multiple injuries while diagnostic accuracy is reduced by difficulties in clinical and radiological investigation.

Two case histories are presented to illustrate these difficulties and guidelines are suggested to help establish the nature and extent of such injuries in young children.
