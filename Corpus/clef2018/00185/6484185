Osteoid osteoma: excision with scintimetric guidance. The definite diagnosis of osteoid osteoma relies on the demonstration of the nidus, best shown by CT, which also provides precise preoperative localization of the nidus. While bone-block excision to remove the nidus is feasible in the long bones, there may be unacceptable sequelae in the vertebral column and small bones of the hands. By precisely localizing the nidus, radionuclide scintimetry permits excellent therapeutic results, with minimal morbidity.
