Hyoid bone elevation: a sign of tracheal transection. Evaluation of traumatic neck injuries should include analysis of the position of the hyoid bone on the lateral radiograph. Location above the level of the third cervical body or a greater cornu located less than 2 cm from the angle of the mandible, or both, coupled with the finding of cervical soft-tissue air, should alert the radiologist that tracheal transection is likely and that immediate surgical exploration is required. Five cases of severe neck injury are presented.
