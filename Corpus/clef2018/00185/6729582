Unstable thoracolumbar fractures. A study by CT and conventional roentgenology of the reduction effect of Harrington instrumentation. Fourteen patients with unstable thoracolumbar fractures were examined with conventional roentgenologic technique and CT before and after operation with Harrington instrumentation. CT was superior in evaluating posterior elements, bone fragments in the spinal canal, and degree of narrowing of the spinal canal. Harrington rods restored the general spinal alignment. However, even after surgery, the midsagittal diameter, as well as the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal were still diminished by 26%. The reduction of the spinal canal improved significantly by early surgical intervention. Open reduction and stabilization with Harrington rods and fusion within three days after injury is recommended.
