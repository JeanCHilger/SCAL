Computed tomographic imaging in cervical vertebral fractures. Spinal computed tomography scanning was performed in five patients with different types of cervical fractures. Computed tomography scanning was superior to plain x-ray studies in determining the narrowing of the spinal canal by bone fragments or soft tissues and in determining the involvement of the intervertebral joints. The value of computed tomography was clearly demonstrated in scanning those regions that are difficult to be examined by conventional radiologic methods. A disadvantage of computed tomography scanning is the impossibility of functional diagnostic investigations and examinations after surgery of patients who underwent stabilization with plates and wires.
