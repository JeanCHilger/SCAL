Internal metal plate fixation combined with anterior interbody fusion in cases of cervical spine injury. The authors report their experience with the use of a modified method of internal metal plate fixation combined with anterior interbody fusion in six patients with an unstable lower cervical spine. All of the patients had sustained severe cervical spine injuries in accidents. In most of the cases, the operation was carried out at 1 to 4 weeks after injury. The insertion of the metal plate was very simple and maintained the block bone graft in satisfactory position. This alternative method of internal fixation of the cervical spine was not associated with morbidity, allowed very early mobilization, and shortened the hospital stay.
