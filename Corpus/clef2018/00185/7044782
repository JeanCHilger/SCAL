CT examination of the spine and the spinal canal. Analogous to its other fields of application, CT of the spine and the spinal canal has also already achieved a permanent place among the diagnostic methods. Numerically, CT studies of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine for our patient population with a total of 460 examinations are in the ratio 2: 1: 4.5. The essential advantages are improved differential diagnosis for many processes, the exact breakdown of the degree of extraspinal and intraspinal involvement in the change, the increasing limitation of myelography and last but not least the possibility of reducing cost.
