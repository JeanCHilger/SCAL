Diagnosis of vertebral fractures. A comparison of conventional radiography, conventional tomography, and computed axial tomography. Thirty patients with acute thoracic, lumbar, or thoracolumbar fractures, dislocations, or fracture-dislocations were evaluated with standard radiographs, conventional polytomography, and computerized axial tomography. The resulting ninety studies were coded, randomized, and independently interpreted by three radiologists. The diagnostic accuracy of the interpretations based on the computerized tomography scans combined with standard radiographs equaled that of the interpretations based on just the tomograms in the evaluation of fractures of posterior elements. In addition, computerized tomography was superior to the other methods in demonstrating impingement on the neural canal as well as injuries to other organ systems. Also, when compared with conventional polytomography, computerized tomography could be completed with less risk to the patient (no changes in position and ten times less radiation). We concluded that computerized tomography should replace conventional polytomography as the initial study to augment standard radiographs in the assessment of thoracic and lumbar fractures. Conventional polytomography should be reserved for patients in whom precise evaluation of the pars interarticularis is deemed necessary.
