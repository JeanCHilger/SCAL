Tumoral medullary compressions in malignant hemopathy (a 28 cases review (author's transl). The authors reviewed 28 cases of tumoral medullary compressions in malignant hemopathy. At once they point out 2 groups according to the fact that this compression is or not the revealing symptom of the disease. With regard to different data, that is to say, preoperative clinical examination with complementary investigations, and then results obtained from decompressive laminectomy followed or not with complementary therapy the elements of the functional prognosis are analysed. They insist on frequency of medullary compression in a neuro surgical environment, as the revealing symptom of the hematologic disease and its immediate decompressive therapy is emphasized.
