Value of myeloscintigraphy in the evaluation of patency of the spinal canal. The authors carried out 66 myeloscintigraphies in 66 patients suspected of having compressing lesions of the spinal cord. In 32 cases the obtained results agreed with the results of contrast myelography which was carried out in 38 patients, and in 22 cases these results were confirmed by operations. In the remaining cases contrast myelography was abandoned in view of unequivocal results of myeloscintigraphy and conservative treatment was started. On the basis of a comparative analysis the authors stated that myeloscintigraphy is safer than contrast myelography, less troublesome for the patient and eliminates the risk connected with contrast medium remaining in the subarachnoideal space. There are practically no contraindications to its use even in outpatients, and it could even be used for screening patients with suspected spinal cord compression. Myeloscintigraphy makes possible the diagnosis of spinal tumours, arachnoideal adhesions and meningocele. In cases of nucleus pulposus prolapse the method is less reliable and less useful. For determination of the character of the pathological lesion and its relation to the spinal cord, and also in cases with doubtful results of myeloscintigraphy contrast myelography should be done.
