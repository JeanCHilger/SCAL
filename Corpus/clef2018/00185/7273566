Craniovertebral anomalies. We have tried to clarify this confusing area by demonstrating the common relationships of these abnormalities. The development of the craniovertebral junction was present in order to understand the formation of the anomalies discussed. The radiologic lines and measurements that have been described are actually to measure the degree of compromise of the functional size of the foramen magnum. This mechanical compromise, either from direct neural compression and/or from a secondary vascular impairment (arterial or venous), leads to the signs and symptoms of cervicomedullary compression.
