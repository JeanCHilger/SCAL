Acute arachnoid cysts in traumatic vertebro-medullary pathology (author's transl). The authors report seven cases of arachnoid cysts of the spinal cord discovered in the immediate post-traumatic period of spinal trauma. Five cases were dorso-lumbar traumas which often did note appear serious on roentgenograms. Similar groups of symptoms were encountered in the different cases, particularly the initial symptomfree period. Immediate surgery is mandatory and the subsequent prognosis is good. Two cases of cervical cysts have a less typical symptomatology and a less favorable operative outcome. The pathophysiology of this acute and evolutive affection is unclear.
