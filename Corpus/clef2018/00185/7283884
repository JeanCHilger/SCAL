Prognosis of vertigo following cranio-cervical injury. The prognosis of vertigo associated with post-traumatic disorder of the head and neck was assessed during long-term observations of 75 patients, Subjective symptoms of vertigos improved 4 years after the first examination in almost all cases. The results of vestibular examination regarding objective symptoms of vertigo were usually fixed at about 2 years after the first examination. Changes in the subjective symptoms and the results of vestibular examinations provided pertinent information for clinical assessments. The EEG findings in these patients showed a close correlation to the improvement of subjective symptoms of vertigo and to alternation in the results of vestibular examination. Post-traumatic neurosis was almost always related to both the subjective symptoms which persisted.
