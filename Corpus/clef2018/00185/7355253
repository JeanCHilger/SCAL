Roentgenological diagnosis of the functioning of the cervical spine (author's transl). Basing on literature and 230 own functional examinations of the cervical spine, the author reports on a roentgenological method which satisfies practical requirements. In patients with degenerative and post-traumatic changes, the extent and localisation of the disorders of function and structure of the vertebrae can be determined by this method, enabling discovery of functional disorders in a large number of patients with clinical cervical spine syndrome. X-ray functional testing is shown to be a necessary complement to conventional x-ray diagnosis and clinical examination.
