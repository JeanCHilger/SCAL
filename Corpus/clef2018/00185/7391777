Individuation in forensic science study: decapitation. In this study we present a technique that may be useful in the individuation of remains separated through the cervical region. Using a series of measurements from young female skeletons in the Terry Collection, we have developed a model for testing congruence between adjacent elements. Emphasis has been placed on identifying those measurements most likely to minimize underestimating the true number of remains present. The use of the technique has been demonstrated in two (retrospective) forensic science examples.
