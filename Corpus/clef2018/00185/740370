High cervical spine and craniocervical junction injuries in fatal traffic accidents: a radiological study. Postmortem radiographic examinations in 312 victims of fatal traffic accidents were analyzed with respect to injuries to the cervical spine. Most fractures and dislocations in this group were found to involve the craniocervical junction and the upper two cervical segments. Over half were flexion injuries, one-fifth caused predominantly by extension. Flexion and extension views were found to be helpful in demonstrating the instability of many injuries.
