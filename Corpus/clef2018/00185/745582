Meningeal seeding from rhabdomyosarcoma of the head and neck with base of the skull invasion: recognition of the clinical evolution and suggestions for management. Rhabdomyosarcomas of the head and neck may spread by diffuse local invasion, resulting in erosion of the base of the skull with possible extension to the leptomeninges, brain, and cranial nerves, as well as invasion of the ventricular system with possible intradural, extramedullary metastases anywhere along the neuraxis. Meningeal spread of tumor is difficult to eradicate, and nearly all patients reviewed died soon after meningeal disease was evident. Patients with erosion of the base of the skull or abnormal cranial nerve findings seem to have a risk of seeding the meninges with tumor. The clinical evolution of this pattern of metastatic spread is reviewed, diagnostic studies are recommended, and therapeutic considerations are discussed. Tentative treatment guidelines are also offered.
