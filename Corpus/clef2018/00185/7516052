Co-incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome and spinal cord compression in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Extradural, radicular and spinal cord compressions are severe neurological complications of lymphomas. Less frequently, involvement of the peripheral nervous system, polymyositis, myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) occur. We report a patient with GBS along with a lymphoma of the spinal extradural space where at the beginning the features of GBS outweighed the symptomatology of the extradural spinal mass.
