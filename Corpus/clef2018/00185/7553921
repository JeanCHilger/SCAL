Head and spine injuries in youth sports. Careful study of the pathomechanics and epidemiology of sports-related spine injuries brings to light many common features. The incidence increases as the sport becomes increasingly violent and aggressive. Improperly conditioned neck muscles and lack of knowledge of the proper techniques of the sport put the athlete who sustains a blow to the head at significant risk for head and/or spine injury. Improper helmet fit and the use of the head as an offensive weapon are also common features. Although recognition of these features has resulted in a dramatic reduction in catastrophic athletic spine injury, the athlete remains at risk for less severe head and spine injury.
