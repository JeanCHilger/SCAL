Epidural spinal cord compression as an initial symptom in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: rapid decompression by local irradiation and systemic chemotherapy. We treated an 11-year-old girl with spinal cord compression near an epidural tumor. Bone marrow examination confirmed the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To reduce the compression we treated her immediately with high-dose dexamethasone and vincristine administered intravenously along with local irradiation. Three days later, radiation was discontinued because magnetic resonance imaging showed that the spinal cord compression was reduced. Complete remission has continued without evidence of neurologic sequelae for more than 3 years since diagnosis. Rapid reduction of the blasts resulted in tumor lysis syndrome, which was treated with conventional management and additional diuresis without hemodialysis. Epidural spinal cord compression in childhood ALL can be treated effectively with systemic chemotherapy and local radiotherapy without laminectomy.
