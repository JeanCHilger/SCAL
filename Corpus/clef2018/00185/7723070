Reduced transverse spinal area secondary to burst fractures: is there a relationship to neurologic injury? A retrospective case-control study was undertaken to determine the best technique to measure neural canal encroachment at each lumbar level following burst fracture and its relationship to the presence of neurologic deficit. Only patients with postinjury CT scans demonstrating a disrupted posterior body with a retropulsed bone fragment were included. Patients were divided into groups based on the level of bony injury (T12-L5) and neurologic status. Neurologic injury was classified as follows: normal (N), root (R), or cauda equina/conus/paraplegic/paraparetic (C/P). The mean transverse spinal area (TSA, cm2), spinal canal percentage patency (PP), and midsagittal diameter (MSD) were determined for each neurologic group and lumbar level. A "calculated" TSA, based on midsagittal and anterior-posterior diameters, was also derived for each patient. The data were compared level by level and correlated with the patient's neurologic status. At L1, the critical TSA was 1.0 cm2. All patients with TSAs less than this were paraplegic. At both T12 and L1, TSAs in the range of 1.0-1.25 cm2 were observed in both normal and neurologically impaired patients. A critically significant TSA was not established for levels T12, L2, L3, L4, or L5 however, the data indicated that a smaller TSA can be tolerated at successively caudal levels without neurologic deficit. No meaningful correlation between root injury and TSA was observed. The data also indicated that measurement of TSA is a more accurate method for evaluating neural canal encroachment than PP or MSD. The "calculated" TSA is a simple, objective method for obtaining this information without the aid of a computer. This study suggests that absolute TSA should be utilized in future studies evaluating decompressive treatment of thoracolumbar pathology.
