Correlation of spinal canal post-traumatic encroachment and neurological deficit in burst fractures of the lower cervical spine (C3-7). Burst fractures of the lower cervical spine (C3-7) are often associated with severe neurological injury. During the last 5 years (1987-1992) we operated on 11 patients who had sustained burst fractures together with neurological deficit. The operations were performed through an anterior approach. The burst vertebra was excised, and the defect was filled with bone graft. Implants (plates and screws) were used in 10 cases. The preoperative examination was conducted by computed tomography and revealed that in 4 patients with complete tetraplegia (Frankel grade A) there was more than 50% spinal canal narrowing, whilst in the remaining 7 patients, with various levels of incomplete tetraplegia, there was less than 50% spinal canal narrowing, resulting in considerable improvement. The above results support the hypothesis that a correlation exists between the magnitude of the spinal canal encroachment, the initial neurological deficit and the final outcome.
