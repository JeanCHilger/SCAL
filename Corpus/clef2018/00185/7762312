Neurosonography after operations for syringomyelia and the Arnold-Chiari malformation type 1. The paper provides the authors' experience in using neurosonography in the diagnosis of osteoneural abnormalities of the vertebral canal and craniovertebral passage in 22 patients operated on for syringomyelia and Type 1 Arnold-Chiari malformation. Comparison of computed tomographic and X-ray findings and intraoperative verification indicate that neurosonography is of high informative value and they provide evidence for its use in a diagnostic set of follow-ups of patients operated on.
