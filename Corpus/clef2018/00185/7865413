Osteoblastoma of the odontoid process. A case of an osteoblastoma located in the odontoid process in a 7 year-old boy who presented with torticollis is reported. CT scan and MRI disclosed the lesion, but diagnosis was established by a CT-guided needle biopsy. Surgery through a transoral approach allowed total excision of the tumor. This is, to our knowledge, the first case reported of an osteoblastoma of the odontoid process.
