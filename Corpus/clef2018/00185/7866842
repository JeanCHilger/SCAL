Osteoid osteoma of the axis. A 15-year-old boy suffering from osteoid osteoma of the right lamina of the axis presented with torticollis and local pain without neurological deficits. The tumour was treated by en-bloc resection and laminoplasty with autogenous iliac crest. The follow-up at 14 months showed complete pain relief and a perfect incorporation of the transplanted bone.
