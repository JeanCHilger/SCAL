Trabecular texture analysis of CT images in the relationship with spinal fracture. To evaluate age-related changes in trabecular texture and bone mineral density (BMD) and to determine the usefulness of texture analysis in the assessment of the risk of fracture.The vertebral trabecular BMD was measured in 209 women aged 18-86 years. Run length analysis was applied to computed tomographic images obtained with 2-mm section thickness. The width of the trabecula (T-texture) and the width of the intertrabecular space (I-texture) were calculated.I-texture significantly increased with age in women 50 years of age or older (P < .0001). Women with fracture had significantly lower BMD (P < .0001 at 60-69 years, P < .05 at 70-79 years) and significantly higher I-texture (P < .05 at 60-69 years, P < .01 at 70-79 years). For fracture risk, BMD had the highest sensitivity and I-texture had the highest specificity in women aged 60-69 years I-texture had the highest sensitivity and specificity in women aged 70-79 years.Texture analysis was helpful in the assessment of fracture risk, especially in elderly women.
