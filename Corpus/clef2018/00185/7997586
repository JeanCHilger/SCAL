Broadband ultrasound attenuation in the diagnosis of osteoporosis: correlation with osteodensitometry and fracture. To evaluate the usefulness of broadband ultrasound attenuation in the prediction of osteoporosis.Broadband ultrasound attenuation measurements of the calcaneus and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements of the lumbar spine and the femoral neck were obtained in 400 patients (295 female and 105 male), 135 of whom were classified as having osteoporosis. Correlation coefficients between broadband ultrasound attenuation and DXA were calculated.Patients with osteoporosis showed a statistically significant decrease in broadband ultrasound attenuation compared with healthy patients (59.7 dB/MHz +/- 1.3 [standard deviation] vs 75.1 dB/MHz +/- 0.8). Broadband ultrasound attenuation correlated statistically significantly with vertebral bone density (r = .49) and femoral neck density (r = .52). At a broadband ultrasound attenuation index of 64 dB/MHz, the sensitivity and specificity were both 85% for patients with osteoporotic fractures.Broadband ultrasound attenuation can be used to help differentiate between patients with osteoporosis and healthy patients and seems to be useful in the prediction of fracture risk.
