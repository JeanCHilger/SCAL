Frequency and volume of resistance training: effect on cervical extension strength. Quantification of cervical extension (CERV EXT) strength is complicated by the inability to stabilize the torso and isolate the CERV EXT muscles. A newly developed machine designed to stabilize the torso and isolate the CERV EXT muscles was used to evaluate the effect of frequency and volume of resistance training on CERV EXT strength. Fifty men (age, 26 +/- 9 years height, 174 +/- 16 cm
