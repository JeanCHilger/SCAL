Compensation behavior after fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine in children and adolescents. Spinal column trauma with a fracture of the breast and lumbar spine is with 2-3% relatively uncommon in the pediatric patient population (from birth-16 years). In a review of 22 patients (7-15 years old) treated between 1978-1988 the individual management of treatment is reported. The goal of our study was to describe the absolute indications for the operative treatment and the difference between conservative and operative procedure depending on the age of the patient. The follow-up study after an average of 7 years and 8 months demonstrated an improvement of the neurological status (neurological status of Frankel) of 8 patients and a spontaneous correction of kyphotic angle from 21 degrees after treatment to 3 degrees.The treatment must be individual and depends on the age of the patient.
