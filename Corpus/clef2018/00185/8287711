CT scanning of spinal injuries. Ninety-one patients with spinal injuries were studied by CT scanning. A comprehensive classification of spinal injuries was proposed according to the mechanism of trauma, the concept of three-column anatomical structure of the spine and the degree of spinal canal stenosis. CT scanning was advantageous in the diagnosis of spinal injuries such as clear detection of the three-column anatomical structure of the spine and spinal canal, demonstration of fracture lines in all 3 planes, determination of the amount of displacement of bony fragment into the spinal canal, assessment of spinal stability or instability, and restricted movement of the patient. The key points in general CT diagnosis, its role and limitation in the diagnosis of spinal injuries were discussed. The authors conclude that combined comprehensive classification of spine injuries is helpful in planning suitable treatment for the patient and predicting prognosis.
