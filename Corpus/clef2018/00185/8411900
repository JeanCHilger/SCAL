Acute spinal syndromes in children and adolescents. 23 children with acute spinal syndromes are presented. The clinical signs were caused by trauma in 11 patients, by extramedullary tumors in 6, by operations (coarctation of the aorta, scoliosis) in 4 and by encephalomyelitis in 2. Motor signs (flaccid paraplegia or paraparesis, monoplegia, bilateral weakness) and changes of reflex intensities were always observed. Most children presented with disturbances of sensory functions and micturition, some exhibited ataxia. In addition to the neurological signs, plain films of the spine were of diagnostic importance after trauma, for tumors myelography and/or computerized tomography were most useful. The unfavourable prognosis of posttraumatic paraplegia may be improved by early application of corticosteroids in very high doses. The value of GM1-ganglioside is controversial. In cases of external compression by tumors a decompression of the spinal cord is urgent. "Spinal cord monitoring" can be used intraoperatively in surgery of scoliosis and coarctation of the aorta to detect neurological complications early. Differential diagnosis and therapies of encephalomyelitis and Guillain-Barr√©-Syndrome are discussed.
