Experience with the use of hyperbaric oxygenation in neurosurgical clinical practice. Hyperbaric oxygenation proved an effective means of hypoxia control in the central nervous system of neurosurgical patients, which manifested itself mostly in a regression of the general cerebral and focal neurological symptoms. The most striking effect of hyperbaric ocygenation was received in cases of complications following cerebrovascular procedures. At the same time signs of normalization of the bioelectrical activity of the brain and of an elevated tonicity of the intracranial vessels were observed. The electrophysiological control of the functional state of the body helps to choose an optimum regimen and to avoid the possible side effects of oxygen toxicity under elevated pressure.
