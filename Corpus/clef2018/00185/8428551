Reversible spinal cord compression caused by extramedullary hematopoietic foci in thalassemia. A now 42-year-old Thai woman was known to have been anaemic since childhood. When aged 33 years she was diagnosed as having beta zero/HBE thalassaemia. Computed tomography demonstrated a tumour in the posterior mediastinum, histologically found to be an extramedullary haematopoietic focus. Subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine (2 g five times weekly), initiated because of massive iron overload, reduced the serum ferritin level from 3,460 ng/ml to less than 500 ng/ml. The haemoglobin level in the subsequent years was between 6 and 8 g/dl. Five years later sensory deficits were noted from the 5th thoracic vertebra downwards. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a tumour which compressed the spinal cord: it, too, was an ectopic haematopoietic focus. The neurological symptoms disappeared after radiotherapy with 3,000 cGy, but they recurred 4 years later. Because of the low radiation reserve of the spinal cord, hypertransfusion treatment was initiated, namely 16 RBC concentrates within 4 months and afterwards two transfusions every 3 months. By this means the haemoglobin level was kept at about 9 g/dl. The tumour had regressed 4 months after onset of treatment. For 2 years since the beginning of the hypertransfusion treatment the patient has remained free of neurological symptoms.
