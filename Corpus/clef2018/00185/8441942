Incomplete neural deficits in thoracolumbar and lumbar spine fractures. Reliability of Frankel and Sunnybrook scales. Because neural status is used both as a treatment determiner and outcome measure, a universal, reliable scale is required. Experienced personnel, provided with concise definitions, demonstrated high inter-rater reliability of Frankel and Sunnybrook scales (Pearson correlation coefficients 0.71-0.91), with 94-100% intra-rater agreement. Both scales correspond to total sensory and motor function but are insensitive to walking and bladder function. Frankel's wide clinical use, reliability, and simplicity identify it to be the preferred measurement system until a better alternative is developed. Discussion of neural status must include description of bladder and walking function.
