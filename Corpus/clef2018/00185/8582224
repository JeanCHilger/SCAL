Dumbbell like neurinoma at upper cervical vertebra: report of 48 cases. 48 dumbbell like neurinoma at upper cervical vertebra were totally removed operatively and confirmed pathologically. Intermittent pain at neck and occiput limitation of neck movement, and numbness or pain at one or both side limbs were the most common symptoms. In the early stage, the disease was difficalt to recognize. If X-ray film of the cervical vertebra at bioblique position showed an enlarged intervertebral foramen, the diagnosis of neurinoma should be highly considered. MRI could make a definite diagnosis. Vertebral artery angiography is of great value. We also introduced experience in how to protect vertebral artery and respiratory function during operation.
