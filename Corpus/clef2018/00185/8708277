Are head, neck and facial injuries markers of domestic violence? Few data exist regarding the relationship between the location of injuries and the presence of domestic violence. This study of 127 people at an inner-city hospital emergency department found that most patients had head, neck and facial injuries. Although only 23 percent of patients with such injuries were victims of domestic violence, 94.4 percent of victims of domestic violence had head, neck and facial injuries. The study results indicate that head, neck and facial injuries could be markers of domestic violence.
