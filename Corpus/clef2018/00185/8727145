Bypass coaptation procedures for cervical nerve root avulsion. In the past, patients with cervical spinal nerve root avulsions were resigned to accept a natural crippling from upper extremity neurological deficits. Recently, bypass coaptation procedures have resulted in functional return of denervated muscles after such avulsions, much to the appreciation of patients. Presented are 12 patients with avulsion of cervical spinal nerve roots that form either the brachial plexus upper trunk (n = 7), lower trunk (n = 1), or all three trunks (n = 4). The patients underwent the new bypass coaptation procedures with complete or partial return of motor and sensory function, which otherwise would be totally nonfunctional. The most dramatic results were noted in those patients who underwent operations within 6 weeks of injury. The results of these procedures offer patients a valid therapeutic modality for an enhanced quality of life after cervical nerve root avulsion.
