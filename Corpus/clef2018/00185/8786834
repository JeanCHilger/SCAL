Traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation with long-term survival. A 6-year-old boy presented with traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation due to a traffic accident. Lateral spinal tomography showed anterior misalignment of the craniocervical junction. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated associated cervicomedullary injury. He underwent an occipital-cervical fusion with implantation of a spinal cord electrical stimulation unit. His consciousness level improved, but he remained quadriplegic and dependent on a respirator 2 years after the injury.
