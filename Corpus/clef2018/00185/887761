Autonomic dysreflexia: an unusual radiologic complication. Two cases of autonomic dysreflexia are reported in which patients with high spinal cord lesions developed untoward effects during a diagnostic radiologic procedure. One patient had a retrograde cystogram and the other had a femoral angiogram. Radiologists should be aware of this potentially hazardous complication which could occur in any patient with a spinal cord lesion at or above T6. It can precipitate severe acute hypertension, acute myocardial failure or intracranial hemorrhage. We reviewed clinical features, etiologies, pathophysiology, treatment and prophylaxis.
