Spinal cord injury and bladder recovery. To investigate whether spinothalamic tract preservation and posterior column sparing are predictors of neurogenic recovery of bladder function after spinal cord injury (SCI). DESIGNS AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review, the initial perianal pinprick sensation (S4.5 dermatomes) and position sense of the great toes were examined and correlated with bladder function at 1 year after SCI in 19 consecutive spinal cord injured patients (age 18 to 68 years), Frankel A-D, with spinal injury (level C-4-T-12). All patients were admitted to the Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center of Delaware Valley (RSCIDDV) within 72 hours of injury between July 1990 and June 1991 and were available for a 1-year follow-up evaluation.The correlation of initial perianal pinprick and great toe position sensation with bladder management approximately 1 year after SCI.During the initial 72 hours, 10 of the 19 patients had positive perianal pinprick sensation and 9 did not feel the pin. Eight patients had positive great toe position sense, and 11 had no proprioception. At the 1-year follow-up visit, 7 of the 10 patients with initial preserved perianal pinprick were voiding volitionally, whereas none of the 9 patients who did not have pinprick voided volitionally at 1-year after SCI. Six of the 8 with initial preserved great toe position sense were voiding volitionally at 1 year, but only 1 of the original 11 without initial toe position sense was voiding volitionally.Both perianal pinprick sensation and toe position sense are sensitive in predicting return of bladder function. Although both tests have positive predictive value, their negative predictive values are much more noteworthy. A patient without initial position sense of the great toes will likely not regain volitional voiding, whereas a patient without initial perianal pinprick sensation will definitely not regain volitional voiding.
