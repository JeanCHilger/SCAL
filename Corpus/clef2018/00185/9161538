Intradural extramedullary tuberculous abscess. Apropos of a case. Intradural extramedullary tuberculous spinal abscess is rare and has a poor prognosis if not diagnosed early and treated adequately. We report the case of 13 year-old boy who presented with an 8-month history of paraplegia. MR imaging demonstrated an intradural extramedullary spinal abscess in the mid-thoracic region. At operation, an encapsulated abscess was removed completely. The tuberculous nature was confirmed with microbiological testing. Postoperative antituberculous chemotherapy resulted in complete recovery. MR imaging can prove very helpful in early diagnosis of this condition, which is particular relevant in countries where tuberculosis is endemic.
