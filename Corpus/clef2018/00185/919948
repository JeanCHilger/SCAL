Diagnosis of seizures of ischemic origin in outpatient practice. Among the group of 216 patients with cerebral attacks, 40 patients were selected with different syncope-like attacks, epileptic nature of which was rejected or was dubious. On the basis of clinical examinations and analysis of the phenomenology of paroxysms, a group of patients was distinguished where there were attacks of sudden falling in cervical osteochondrosis and a syncopal vertebrogenic syndrome, patients with simple and convulsive syncopes, as well as patients with cerebral attacks of an uncertain origin. It is assumed that there may be an ischemic genesis of syncope-like attacks, on the background of which an inclusion of secondary epileptic mechanisms is possible, especially in some individuals with constitutional or acquired predisposition to epilepsy. This may cause a development of convulsive phenomena and a corresponding EEG picture. Consequently the authors discuss the expediency of including anti-epileptic preparations into the scheme of such patients.
