Head, face, and neck trauma from large animal injury in New Mexico. Head, face, and neck injuries (HFNI) occur during animal-related trauma. We compared patients with HFNI and without HFNI after animal-related injuries to determine the significance of these injuries.Retrospective review of admissions for animal injuries between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1995, by age, gender, mechanism, animal, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Severity score for head and neck (AIS Head/Neck), AIS score for face (AIS Face), intensive care unit stay, hospitalization length, morbidity, and mortality.There were 153 admissions: 61 HFNI and 92 no HFNI. Significant differences occurred in gender, animal, activity, GCS, and ISS. HFNI had higher AIS Head/Neck, AIS Face, and mortality. HFNI were from horses in 87% and occurred during recreation in 89% 39% of patients with HFNI were 18 years or younger.HFNI occur in females and young people and produce lower GCS score, higher ISS, higher AIS Head/Neck, higher AIS Face, and higher mortality. Most occur during recreational horseback riding. Protective headgear should be mandated.
