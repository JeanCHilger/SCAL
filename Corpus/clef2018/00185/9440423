Functional outcome following spinal cord injury: significance of motor-evoked potentials and ASIA scores. Prediction of outcome of ambulatory capacity and hand function in tetraplegic patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) using neurologic examination, according to the protocol of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP).Correlation study on a prospective cohort.SCI center, university hospital.Thirty-six patients with acute and 34 with chronic SCI.(1) ASIA motor and sensory scores, (2) MEP recordings of upper and lower limb muscles, and (3) outcome of ambulatory capacity and hand function.In acute and chronic SCI, both the initial ASIA scores and the MEP recordings were significantly related (p < .0001) to the outcome of ambulatory capacity and hand function. In tetraplegic patients, the MEP of the abductor digiti minimi muscle (Spearman correlation coefficient, .75 p < .0001) and the ASIA motor score for the upper limbs (Spearman correlation coefficient, .83Both ASIA scores and MEP recordings are similarly related to the outcome of ambulatory capacity and hand function in patients with SCI. MEP recordings are of additional value to the clinical examination in uncooperative or incomprehensive patients. The combination of clinical examination and MEP recordings allows differentiation between the recovery of motor function (hand function, ambulatory capacity) and that of impulse transmission of descending motor tracts.
