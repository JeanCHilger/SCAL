Malignant tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath (MPNST) after irradiation. A case of relapsed malignant tumor of the brachial plexus and its nervous roots (MPNST) was observed in a patient treated with radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease 24 years previously. A known risk of radiation therapy is the induction of secondary neoplasms, less commonly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). The clinico-pathological features of this rare tumor are presented and the possible relationship between radiotherapy and MPNST is discussed.
