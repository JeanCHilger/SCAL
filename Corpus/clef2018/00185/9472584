Isolated laryngotracheal separation following blunt trauma to the neck. Isolated laryngotracheal separation following blunt trauma to the neck is a very rare subset of laryngeal trauma and has not been previously well characterized. A 'clothes-line' type injury is one way in which such an injury may occur in which a cyclist rides into a rope or cable. A case of this kind is presented, followed by a discussion of the relevant clinical symptoms and signs as well as the difficulties in making a diagnosis. The critical role of fibre-optic subglottoscopy and tracheoscopy in reaching this diagnosis is also examined.
