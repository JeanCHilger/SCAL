Epidural hematoma of the clivus. Case report. This 8-year-old boy presented with a rare case of epidural hematoma of the clivus and atlantoaxial dislocation caused by a hyperflexion injury sustained in a traffic accident. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an epidural hematoma in the posterior fossa that compressed the pons and medulla. On admission, the patient was confused and had bilateral abducens palsy. He was treated conservatively, and 6 months after admission, the epidural hematoma on the clivus had disappeared on MR imaging and the bilateral abducens palsy was cured. Only two such cases have been reported in the literature. In this report, the authors discuss the mechanism of hematoma formation in this region of the brain.
