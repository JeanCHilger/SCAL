A preterm infant with upper cervical spinal cord injury, following delivery with Kielland's forceps. A report is presented of a male infant who was born at 34 weeks' gestation, following rotation and delivery using Kielland's forceps. The initial diagnosis of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy delayed recognition of an upper cervical spinal and cord injury, which was subsequently confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The infant never developed spontaneous respiration and died following withdrawal of intensive care at 21 days of age.
