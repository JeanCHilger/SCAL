Ipsilateral omovertebral bones in the levator scapulae muscle and the rhomboid muscle in a Sprengel deformity: case report. Our interest was stimulated by the uncommon case of a 4-year-old girl who presented a Sprengel deformity associated with two omovertebral bones on the same side. The first omovertebral bone was situated in the levator scapulae muscle and the second omovertebral bone was lying in the rhomboid muscle. The removal of these two bones was combined with a Woodward procedure to obtain a good correction.
