Cervical spinal meningioma with unusual MR contrast enhancement. A 16-year-old girl had progressive neck pain and weakness in the left hand. MR images showed a dumbbell-shaped spinal tumor with a prominently enhancing intradural component and a minimally enhancing extradural component. Pathologic examination revealed a meningioma with an intradural transitional component and an extradural syncytial component. The tumor showed no significant cystic change or necrosis.
