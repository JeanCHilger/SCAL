Intramedullary lipoma of dorsocervicothoracic spinal cord with intracranial extension and hydrocephalus. An intradural, intramedullary lipoma originating within the cervicothoracic cord with significant extension into the posterior fossa is reported. The lipoma was found incidentally by CT scan at the infant's age of 2 days. Follow-up studies by CT and MRI were performed on several occasions. Because of hydrocephalus, VP shunting was performed. After shunting and shunt revisions, surgery of lipoma was performed at the age of 2 years. Posterior fossa craniectomy and laminectomy from C1 to T4 revealed a lipoma, which was maximally reduced. Six months after surgery, the child was well and showed good recovery.
