Neuromuscular dysfunction of the lower urinary tract in patients with lesions of the cauda equina and conus medullaris. Bladder and urethral function was studied in 21 patients with lesions of the cauda equina or conus medullaris using gas cystometry, integrated sphincter electromyography, uroflowmetry and computer assisted measurement of detrusor and urethral innervation. An areflexic cystometrogram, impaired electromyographic sphincter activity and delayed reflex-evoked potentials from stimulation of the detrusor muscle and urethra were the most consistent indicators of lesions of the conus medullaris and/oather than the ice water test is suggested.
