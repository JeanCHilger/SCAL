Spinal trauma: new guidelines for assessment and management in the out-of-hospital environment. The keys to appropriate management of patients with spinal trauma lie in attending to life-threatening injuries, avoiding unnecessary movement of the spinal column, and carefully documenting patient reliability, MOI, history, physical examination findings, interventions, and responses to interventions. Who should be immobilized? Any victim of trauma complaining of neck or back pain, any patient with neurologic symptoms compatible with a spinal cord injury, and any patient who has an altered mental status or distracting injury should be immobilized. Given that not a single survivor of an SCI from World War I was alive by the start of World War II, one can appreciate the advances that have been made in the care of patients with spinal cord injuries. Exciting research is being conducted to explore the possibility of spinal cord regeneration by implanting tissue over which axons would regrow and make the appropriate connections, and pharmaceutical companies are spending millions to find an agent that will successfully salvage cells in human trials however, a cure still seems elusive. Despite the marvels of modern research, prevention is still the key, including public education relative to wearing seat belts, instructing parents in the use of child restraint devices, encouraging people to jump rather than to dive when testing the depth of water (first time, feet first), enforcing driving under the influence laws, and outlawing such practices as spear tackling in football. In the meantime, EMS and ED personnel have a phenomenal opportunity to truly act as patient advocates by becoming familiar with new immobilization guidelines, honing their assessment skills, and providing anticipatory, compassionate care to those with neurologic deficits.
