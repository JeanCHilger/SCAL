Vertebral hemangiomas: diagnosis, management, natural history and clinicopathological correlates in 86 patients. Vertebral hemangiomas are characterized by diverse clinical histories, radiological features, and results of surgical treatment. It still remains unclear how these differences in clinical behavior relate to pathological type.A retrospective diagnostic, surgical, and histopathological study of 86 consecutive patients with various pathological types of vertebral hemangioma was performed to establish clinicopathological correlates.The study confirmed that differences exist in clinical course, appearance on imaging, and outcomes in pathological types of hemangiomas. Based on these findings the authors attempted to identify signs characterizing each group.Differences in clinical history and radiological features exist among pathological types of vertebral hemangiomas. These differences cannot precisely predict the type pathology before histologic examination, but do help us to understand the natural history of such lesions more fully.
