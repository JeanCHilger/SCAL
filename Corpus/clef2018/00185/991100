Lymphoma of the spinal extradural space. Ninety-four patients with lymphoma involving the extradural space with spinal cord compression proven at the time of laminectomy were reviewed. There were about three times as many patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma than with Hodgkin's disease. The majority of those with Hodgkin's disease had a proven histologic diagnosis before the onset of the spinal cord compression syndrome, whereas only 15% of those with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had previously been so diagnosed. Plain roentgenograms of the spine were suggestive of tumor involvement in less than one-third of the patients, whereas myelograms were invariably abnormal. As noted by others, the outlook for functional recovery and extended life expectancy is relatively good for patients with this type of cancer, in contrast to reports in the literature regarding prognosis for patients who have metastatic carcinoma with extradural spinal cord compression.
