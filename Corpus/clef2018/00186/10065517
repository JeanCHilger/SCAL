Facet coverage in children on flexion lateral cervical radiographs. This radiographic study was designed to attempt to develop standards of facet coverage (overlap) on lateral cervical radiographs during voluntary flexion.To produce normative standards for minimum facet coverage in children.Previous studies on normative standards of facet coverage have been performed only in adults.Thirty-six children with minor trauma had lateral flexion-extension radiographs. A standard filming sequence was used in all. Facet joint overlap at each level was divided by the anteroposterior diameter of the upper adjacent cervical body at each level.On linear regression analysis, these ratios did not vary significantly with age at C2-C3 through C6-C7. Means and standard deviations were determined for C2-C7.These ratios may prove useful in evaluation of children with possible ligamentous injury.
