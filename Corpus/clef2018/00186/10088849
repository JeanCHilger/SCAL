Association of head trauma with cervical spine injury, spinal cord injury, or both. Links between cervical spine and/or spinal cord injuries and head trauma have not been reported in detail.188 patients with cervical spine and/or spinal cord injury were divided into two groups, i.e., with upper cervical and mid-lower cervical injury, and compared for head injury.Associated head trauma was investigated in 188 patients with cervical spine and/or spinal cord injuries 35% had moderate or severe injuries. Brain damage was more frequently observed in patients with upper cervical injury than in those with mid to lower cervical injury. Those patients with upper cervical injury appeared to have an elevated risk of suffering skull base fractures, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and contusional hemotoma.Approximately one third of patients with cervical spine and/or spinal cord injuries had moderate or severe head injuries.
