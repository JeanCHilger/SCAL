Using seat contour measurements during seating evaluations of individuals with SCI. Measuring the shape of the buttock-cushion interface has been used successfully in research to study tissue loading and as a means to fabricate custom contoured cushions.  Seat contours are also able to provide useful clinical information on the weight-bearing surface of the cushion, which can be used to address posture.  This article offers specific case studies that demonstrate how the analysis of seat contours can be used to identify pelvic tilt, pelvic obliquity, and areas of high loading.  Seat contour measurements complement other clinical measures, such as seat interface pressures and general postural assessments, to form a more complete picture of the buttock-cushion interface.  They have become useful in the clinical management of various pressure and posture problems experienced by individuals with spinal cord injury and other wheelchair users.
