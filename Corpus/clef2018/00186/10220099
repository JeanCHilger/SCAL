Childhood leukemia presenting with back pain and vertebral compression fractures. Vertebral body collapse and back pain are an unusual presentation for childhood leukemia. This report is intended to promote greater awareness that acute lymphocytic leukemia can cause significant back pain in children without other systemic symptoms. We describe four cases in which patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia presented with back pain and vertebral compression fractures. All of the patients were initially misdiagnosed. No patient had neurologic compromise, despite extensive vertebral body collapse. The back pain was relieved after chemotherapy.
