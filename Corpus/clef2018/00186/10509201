Z-plate instrumentation in thoracolumbar spinal fractures. Anterior decompression enables direct access and good canal clearance of the injury level in thoracolumbar spinal fractures, and decompressing the neural elements is shown to be an important factor for neurologic improvement and pain relief in many cases. In this study, results with anterior decompression and Z-plate instrumentation in thoracolumbar spinal fractures are reviewed. Nineteen patients with old spinal fracture (average: 3 years) and neural compression, and 15 patients with fresh thoracolumbar fractures with neurologic deficit and/or major anterior spinal canal obstruction had anterior decompression and Z-plate instrumentation with anterior fusion. Stabilization was protected with thoracolumbar thermoplastic braces for six months. Preoperative kyphotic deformity averaged 20.9 degrees (range: 7 degrees to 64 degrees), while it was an average of 8.0 degrees (range: -12 degrees to 35 degrees) postoperatively. Medullary canal compromise was 41% an average (range: 13% to 67%) and postoperatively it had an average value of 6% (range: 0% to 18%). Patients were followed up an average of 30 months (range: 25 to 36 months). The unchanged positions of bone grafts and statistically insignificant loss of correction in the sagittal plane are accepted as evidence for bony fusion in all patients. Z-plate instrumentation provides stable fixation. Additionally, the technique can be performed easily and has the added benefit of being MRI-compatible.
