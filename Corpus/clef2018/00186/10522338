A 15-year-old with back pain, fever, and leg numbness. Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is an uncommon entity. We report an adolescent presenting with fever and back pain beginning 3 months after a leg abscess. This case highlights several important aspects of the diagnosis and care of patients with SEA. As illustrated by this case, plain radiographs and computed tomography of the spine can miss the diagnosis, thus when spinal epidural abscess is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice. Epidural abscesses most commonly arise from hematological dissemination, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most often cultured organism. Surgical intervention early combined with the administration of proper antibiotics leads to the best outcome.
