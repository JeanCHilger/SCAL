Primary Ewing's sarcoma (ES) of the spine is uncommon, exhibiting a variety of appearances on plain-film radiographs and cross-sectional images. We report the unusual CT imaging manifestations of a primary ES with a coarse trabecular pattern that mimicked an aggressive hemangioma of the cervical spine.
