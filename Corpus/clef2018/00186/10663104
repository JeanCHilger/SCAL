Anterior screw fixation for odontoid fractures. The results of anterior screw fixation of odontoid fractures in 28 patients are presented. There were 27 type II- and 1 type III-injuries. Non-union with persistent instability had to be notified in one patient (3.6 %), secondary posterior C1/2 fusion had to be performed. Incorrect positioning of the screws in the odontoid with penetration of the postero-lateral cortex occurred in 3 patients (10.7 %). Malpositioning of the odontoid after screw fixation was documented in 5 cases (17.9 %). Cardiopulmonary complications had to be treated in 5 patients (17.9 %), 4 patients (14.3 %) died in the postoperative period. 17 patients could be followed up. Only 3 patients (17.8 %) were free of symptoms. A significant limitation in ROM of axial rotation was seen in 44 % of the patients. With anterior screw fixation of the odontoid high fusion rates can be achieved, however the procedure is technically demanding. Regarding the functional outcome, there is no significant difference to other established treatment methods.
