Medical management of eosinophilic granuloma of the cervical spine. We report a case of eosinophilic granuloma involving the vertebral bodies of the cervical spine in a 33-month-old girl. This lesion was diagnosed by needle biopsy and treated with prednisone and vinblastine therapy along with immobilization in a Minerva brace. The child has done well over a 9-month follow-up and has shown MRI evidence of resolution of the lesion, reestablishment of structural integrity within the cervical spine and potential reconstitution of the involved vertebral bodies.
