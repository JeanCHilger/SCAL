One-stage removal of a large dumb-bell-shaped cervical neurinoma without laminectomy or interbody fusion in a child. A 12-year-old boy had a large dumb-bell-shaped cervical neurinoma originating at the C5 spinal root that was removed in a one-stage operation through the enlarged C4/5 intervertebral foramen. This technique required no laminectomy, discectomy or interbody fusion, which may frequently produce spinal deformity in children.
