Case study: acceleration/deceleration injury with angular kyphosis. To discuss the case of a patient who received upper cervical chiropractic care after trauma-induced arcual kyphosis in the cervical spine. A practical application of conservative management for posttrauma cervical spine injury in the private office setting is described.A 17-year-old female patient suffered an unstable C3/C4 motor segment after a lateral-impact motor vehicle collision. Additional symptoms on presentation included vertigo, tinnitus, neck and shoulder pain, and confusion.Conservative management consisted exclusively of upper cervical-specific adjustments guided by radiographic analysis and paraspinal bilateral skin temperature differential analysis of the cervical spine. During 10 weeks of care and 22 office visits, all symptoms subsided and the instability of C3/C4 motor segment appeared to be completely resolved.This study provides support for the use of upper cervical chiropractic management in cervical spine trauma cases. The clinical work-up consisted of physical examination, radiographic analysis, computer-administered and scored cognitive function testing, and audiometric examination. After conservative care, these examinations were repeated and demonstrated that the objective findings concurred with the subjective improvements reported by the patient.
