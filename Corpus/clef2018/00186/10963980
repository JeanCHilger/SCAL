Traumatic spinal epidural hematoma of a 10-month-old male: a clinical note. Traumatic spinal epidural hematoma (TSEH) is rare in children. Only three cases of TSEH were documented in the pediatric literature. This clinical note presents an infant with TSEH but no risk factors. Without magnetic resonance imaging examination, children with TSEH and minor symptoms may be missed and under reported. Signs such as irritability and neck pain should alert the clinician to consider TSEH and the need for urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the spine for early diagnosis and treatment to minimize morbidity.
