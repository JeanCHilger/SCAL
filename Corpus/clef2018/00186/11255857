Spinal cord injury following knife stab wound. Problems about penetrating injuries are well known, but spinal cord damage is rare. Stab wounds to the spinal cord may be a new type of injury in our society.We describe two patients brought to our hospital with stab wounds to the cervicothoracic region and major neurologic injury. One was treated initially only with cleaning and primary closure of the skin. After two weeks the intraspinal damage was repaired in our neurosurgical unit. The second patient was immediately brought to neurosurgery. The intraspinal damage was explored and the dural tear was closed.The first patient got a superficial infection and spinal fluid leakage after initial treatment. This resolved when the dura was closed. There were no wound complications in the second patient. Both demonstrated Brown-SÃ©quard's syndrome. Neurologic recovery was much better in the first than in the second patient.Minor penetrating wounds in the neck region may represent damage to the spinal cord with major neurologic injury. Further investigation with MR is preferable and we recommend immediate surgical treatment with closure of the dural tear.
