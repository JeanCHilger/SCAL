Tuberculosis of the craniocervical junction. Tuberculosis of the craniocervical junction is rare even where the condition is endemic. It poses problems in both diagnosis and management. We describe 25 cases followed over a period of 12 years, and relate the presentation, diagnosis and management. Of our 25 patients 16 were managed conservatively and nine by surgery. In order to diagnose this condition a high index of suspicion and advanced imaging techniques are necessary. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment led to good results without fatal complications.
