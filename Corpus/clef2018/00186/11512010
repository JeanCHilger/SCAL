Severe cervical kyphosis in osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis: case report. We report a 29-month-old girl with osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OS-CS), who showed several unusual manifestations, including short stature, muscular hypotonia, short lingual frenulum, an accessory ear and a granuloma at the oral edge. The most unusual distressing finding was severe cervical kyphosis with a dysplastic cervical spine. MRI revealed impingement of the upper spinal cord. To clarify the mode of inheritance of this disease in this patient, we performed a methylation-specific PCR analysis. It eventually showed random inactivation of X-chromosomes, suggesting an autosomal dominant trait.
