Simultaneous noncontiguous cervical spine injuries in a pediatric patient: case report. Noncontiguous traumatic injuries of the cervical spine in children are rare. We present the case of a child who simultaneously sustained a separation of the odontoid synchondrosis and a C6-C7 dislocation with a complete spinal cord injury. The management of simultaneous cervical spine injuries is discussed.A boy aged 4 years and 2 months was a restrained back-seat passenger involved in a head-on motor vehicle accident. The patient lacked neurological function below C7. Imaging studies revealed a separation of the odontoid synchondrosis as well as a traumatic dislocation of the spine at C6-C7.The patient was placed in a halo vest shortly after admission. Four days after his injury, he underwent a posterior wiring and fusion of C6 to C7. As the C6-C7 dislocation was reduced by posterior element wiring, intraoperative x-rays showed a gradual increase in the subluxation of C1 on C2. This increase in C1-C2 subluxation required intraoperative repositioning of the halo crown on the ventral halo vest posts to maintain acceptable C1-C2 alignment. Postoperatively, ideal alignment of the odontoid peg on the body of C2 could not be achieved by halo adjustments alone. The patient required a custom-made posterior neck cushion attached to the halo vest to maintain cervical lordosis and good alignment of the odontoid peg on the body of C2.Simultaneous traumatic cervical spine injuries in pediatric patients are rare. The intraoperative reduction of one spine injury can affect the alignment at the location of the second injury. In this case, a custom adjustment of the halo vest improved the alignment of the odontoid peg on the body of C2.
