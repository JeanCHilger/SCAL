Neurotrauma in Pakistan. The incidence of head and spinal injury is on the rise in developing countries. The number of deaths and burden of disability may be reduced, if not completely stopped, through preventive measures after an epidemiological survey on trauma. The goal can be achieved to a significant extent through the use of guidelines from the countries that have achieved a reduction in the incidence of neurotrauma. To determine the incidence and outcome of neurotrauma in developing countries, a study was necessary using standardized assessment parameters for global interpretation. Such a study was conducted to determine the sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, and mortality of patients with head and spinal injury admitted to various neurosurgical centers in Pakistan from July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1999. A total of 260,000 patients were admitted with head injury over a 4-year period. The majority of patients presented during second decade (i.e., 33.2%) followed by first and third decade. There were 195,000 (75%) males, and 65,000 (25%) females with a ratio of 3:1. Road traffic accident was the commonest cause of head trauma. Mild, moderate, and severe head injury was observed in 135,200 (52%), 78,000 (30%), and 46,800 (18%) patients, respectively. Conservative management was carried out in 176,800 (68%) patients. Surgery was required in 83,200 (32%), 50% of which had depressed skull fracture, simple or compound. Follow-up period varied from 2 months to 2 years with a mean of 11 months. Patient's outcome was assessed according to Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Good outcome was observed in 174,200 (67%). The total mortality was 46,800 (18%). In this study, 2654 patients ranging in age from 5 to 70 years had spinal injuries. There were 1922 males (72%) and 732 (28%) females. British Medical Research Council Scale was used for assessment of motor power of patients with spinal trauma. Of these, 780 patients (29%) had complete spinal cord injury. Surgical intervention was performed in 1800 patients (68%) and the rest were managed conservatively.
