Design and clinical application of cervical hollow threaded fixator. Cervical hollow threaded fixator (CHTF) was designed and applied to stabilize the cervical spine following anterior decompression due to cervical spondylosis or acute cervical disc herniation.Medical use titanium alloy with no magnetism was made into a hollow threaded structure with holes on the wall of the fixator. Forty-two patients with cervical spondylosis and acute cervical disc herniation were stabilized using the CHTF technique after anterior decompression. X-ray films and CT scans were taken after the operation to observe the stability and fusion rate of the segments.Patients were allowed to walk one day after the operation and were followed up for 6 to 36 months. The operated segments were stable and solid fusion was observed 3-6 months after surgery.Immediate stability of the operated segments can be obtained using the CHTF technique. Patients were easy to manage after the operation and returned to their jobs in a short time. The CHTF technique is safe and simple to perform and eliminates the complications of an autograft. It may be an alternative to traditional cervical interbody fusion with bone graft.
