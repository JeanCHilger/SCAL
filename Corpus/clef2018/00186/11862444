Acute paraplegia revealing an intraspinal neurenteric cyst in a child. The authors report a case of intraspinal neurenteric cyst in a 22-month-old child, who presented with acute paraplegia following a vesicourethrogram. Despite 8 days' delay in surgical decompression, he made a complete neurological recovery. Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital lesions of the spinal canal lined with an epithelium of endodermal origin. They are usually located at the cervicothoracic junction and present with progressive mild to moderate signs of myelopathy. This is a unique case in regard both to its clinical presentation and to the excellent outcome after 8 days of complete paraplegia.
