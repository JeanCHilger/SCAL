Persistent hyperextension of the neck in breech ("star-gazing fetus") and in transverse lie ("flying-fetus"): indication for cesarean section. All pregnancies with a breech or transverse lie should be examined roentgenologically, at least after the onset of labor, and those in whom hyperextension of the neck persists should be sectioned to avoid the real danger of injury to the cervical cord incurred in vaginal delivery. The radiologist should not assume a seriously deformed fetus just from the hyperextension most of these fetuses are otherwise normal.
