An Australian experience of managing pressure ulcers in persons with SCI. Pressure ulcers are a difficult and complex problem, frequently resulting in poor patient outcomes and significantly increased cost of care. This project evolved from a desire to improve the management and subsequent outcomes for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) who experience pressure ulcers acquired in the community. The vast body of work related to pressure ulcers has focused on risk assessment and prevention. However, there has been little interest in the management of prevailing pressure ulcers. Using a retrospective case history audit and interviews with patients and health care workers from an Australian spinal services unit, current practices associated with the care of pressure ulcers are described. A number of issues are identified that relate to funding, diet, attitudes, consistency of care, and low levels of staff interest in pressure ulcer management. This work provides baseline data from which current management practices can be reviewed, revised, and empirically evaluated.
