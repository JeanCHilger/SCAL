Prognostic outcome indicators following hanging injuries. Hanging as a method of attempting suicide is increasing in incidence. A retrospective review of victims of hanging injuries presenting to our institution over a 5-year period was performed. Forty-two cases were reviewed. Drug and/or alcohol ingestion was identified in 70% of cases. There were no cervical spine injuries identified, although two unexpected thoracic spine fractures were found. There was an 88% survival rate, with a low incidence (5%) of poor neurological outcome. The Glasgow Coma Score at scene or on arrival at hospital was found to be a prognostic indicator. Victims without spontaneous cardiac output at scene did not survive, even if cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful initially.
