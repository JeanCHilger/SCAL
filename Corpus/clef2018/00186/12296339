Delayed presentation of lymphatic malformation of the cervicofacial region: role of trauma. Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are uncommon congenital lesions that may occur throughout the body, although the head and neck region is the most common site. Most LMs are seen at birth. However, they may present in adolescence or adulthood, mainly as a result of trauma or infection. We report the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented with an LM of the cervicofacial region causing airway compression. We discuss the causes of delayed presentation of these congenital lesions. An overview of the causation, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment options is presented.
