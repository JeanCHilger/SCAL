A bone and cable girth-hitch technique for atlantoaxial fusion in pediatric patients. Technical note. A new technique for performing a posterior rib and multistranded cable atlantoaxial fusion in children is described. The technique has been used successfully, in two patients 22 and 18 months of age, respectively. In both cases, fusion was used to augment C1-2 transarticular screw fixation, and solid arthrodesis was achieved without a halo orthosis.
