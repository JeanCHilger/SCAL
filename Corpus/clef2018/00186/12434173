Congenital reducible atlantoaxial dislocation: classification and surgical considerations. Reducible atlanto-axial dislocation (AAD) may cause severe motor and respiratory compromise due to recurrent spinal cord and/or brain stem impingement. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study concentrating on the classification, the protocol of the surgical management and the outcome of congenital, reducible AAD.109 patients with congenital, reducible AAD underwent posterior stabilization. Their preoperative disability was graded as: I (n=11, 10.09%) no functional disability (a history of minor trauma led to quadriparesis that subsequently improved) II (n=31, 28.44%) independent for activities of daily living with minor disabilityAt follow-up (ranging from 3 months to 6 years n=86), 64 patients had shown improvement by one grade or moreThe patients with congenital reducible AAD, depending on their surgical management, may be classified into four groups. Some patients with a dysplastic odontoid have a "hypermobile" AAD and require special care during intubation, positioning and stabilization. An assimilated posterior arch is often associated with asymmetrical lateral occipito-C1-C2 joint synostosis rendering transarticular screw placement difficult. The various causes of failure of constructs are discussed.
