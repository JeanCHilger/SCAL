Injury to the spinal cord without any radiographic abnormality in a child. Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormalities (SCIWORA) is a diagnostic challenge most commonly encountered in pediatric patients. The unique hypermobility and ligamentous laxity of the pediatric bony cervical and thoracic spine may predispose to SCIWORA. A four-year-old girl was admitted for polytrauma. During monitorization deterioration in her neurological status was observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an abnormal intensity in the spinal cord at the level of T11-L3, suggesting SCIWORA. We did not consider surgery and treated the patient with a conservative approach and rehabilitation program. The patient achieved a functional capacity sufficient to perform essential activities. A detailed neurologic examination should be undertaken particularly in polytrauma pediatric patients and MRI should be employed in suspected cases.
