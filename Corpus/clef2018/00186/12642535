Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Cervical spine imaging in children under 9 after trauma. A short cut review was carried out to establish whether the odontoid peg view is useful to radiologically exclude cervical spine injury in children under 9 years of age. Altogether 156 papers were found using the reported search, of which two presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. In addition recent guidelines are noted. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.
