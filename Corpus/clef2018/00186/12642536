Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Need for cervical spine imaging for alert children after trauma. A short cut review was carried out to establish whether clinical examination can be used to exclude cervical spine injury in alert children. Altogether 298 papers were found using the reported search, of which three presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.
