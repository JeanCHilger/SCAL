Interventional lumbar spine radiology. Three different techniques will be discussed. The first procedure is the biopsy of the lumbar vertebra or lumbar intervertebral disc for patients with tumors or infections of the lumbar spine. The different needles that can be used in function of consistency and location of the lesion will be shown. The transpedicular and posterolateral techniques will be described. Cementoplasty for tumors and selected patients with osteoporotic vertebral collapse generates much interest. The transpedicular and posterolateral techniques will be described. Indications and complications, more frequent in patients with tumors, will be reviewed. Finally, foraminal injections of steroids in patients with radicular symptoms secondary to degenerative change will be discussed. Techniques for needle placement will be reviewed. Results from these injections will also be reviewed.
