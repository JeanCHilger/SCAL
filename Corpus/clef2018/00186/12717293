MRI of the abnormal cervical spinal cord using 2D spoiled gradient echo multiecho sequence (MEDIC) with magnetization transfer saturation pulse. A T2* weighted feasibility study. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of heavily T2* weighted 2D spoiled gradient echo multiecho sequence MEDIC (multi echo data image combination) with magnetization transfer saturation pulse (MTS) for detecting abnormality of the cervical spinal cord.11 patients, 5 women and 6 men aged from 14 to 79 years (mean age 51.18 years), with traumatic, hemolytic-hemorrhagic or neoplastic diseases of the cervical spinal cord were examined with MRI. In cases with suspected myelopathy, the feasibility of the 2D spoiled gradient echo multiecho sequence MEDIC with MTS was evaluated in comparison with the results of spin echo T1W, spin echo T2W, multi echo (TSE in our case) and spin-echo multi-echo technique with magnetization preparation (turbo inversion recovery--TIR--in our case) sequences.Distortion of the "H" sign was found in all but one case. Hemorrhage was best shown by MEDIC, massive edema was very well visible using MEDIC, TIR and TSE T2W, whereas mild edema was visible with MEDIC only.Our preliminary experience in 11 patients shows that MEDIC can be used for the diagnosis of cervical spinal cord pathology.
