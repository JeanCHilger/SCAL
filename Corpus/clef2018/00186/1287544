Oesophageal trauma in patients with spinal cord injury. Oesophageal perforations associated with cervical fractures occur from a variety of injuries. Fractures of the cervical spine, blunt trauma and penetrating injuries such as gunshot wounds, knives and missiles, perforate the cervical oesophagus. This retrospective study consists of 24 patients with an oesophageal perforation and cervical fracture. Motor vehicle accidents were responsible for 54% of the oesophageal perforations. The other oesophageal injuries were related to anterior spine surgery, gunshot wounds and sports-related activities. The clinical features related to these injuries included the obvious signs of an oesophageal perforation as well as fever of unknown origin, leukocytosis and unexplained persistent tachycardia. A variety of techniques was used to establish the diagnosis. All the patients had treatment for the cervical fracture and 20 patients required surgical repair of the oesophagus. The most common oesophageal complications were stricture of the oesophagus (54%) and oesophageal diverticulum (10%). The other complications were atelectasis, pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pulmonary embolism, cervical osteomyelitis, cervical abscess, mediastinitis, septicemia and cervical fistulae. These patients have a serious life-threatening illness that may be difficult to diagnose and treat.
