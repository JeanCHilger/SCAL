Treatment options in primary Ewing's sarcoma of the spine: report of seven cases and review of the literature. Primary Ewing's sarcoma of the spine is reviewed, and seven cases are presented. Ewing's sarcoma of the spine is a rare condition that appears with a clinical triad of local pain, neurological deficit, and a palpable mass. The clinical picture, imaging characteristics, and management are discussed. The definitive management of Ewing's sarcoma of the spine, as in other locations, could include three main modalities: surgery, radiotherapy, and combination chemotherapy. In the presence of acute neurological decompensation, decompressive surgery via an appropriate approach should be performed. Because Ewing's sarcoma is usually sensitive to chemotherapy, initial chemotherapy, in neurologically stable patients, could be attempted first without surgical resection. Further management could then be gauged according to the response.
