Late results after lumbar vertebrae fracture with Lorenz Böhler conservative treatment. We report on a clinical and radiological follow-up of patients who had sustained a fracture of their lumbar spine between 1982 and 1989 and were treated at our department by the method of Lorenz Böhler. 244 patients left our clinic with a plaster bodice after fracture reposition, 153 came to the follow-up (most of the cases are documented radiologically from the first to the follow-up x-ray). Our results are similar to the outcomes which are published after early functional treatment. We could not find a relationship between the radiological and clinical results and we saw, that it is impossible to fix the spine sufficiently in a plaster bodice without fracture redislocation.
