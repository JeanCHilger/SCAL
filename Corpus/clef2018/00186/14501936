Benign fibrous histiocytoma of the posterior arch of C1 in a 6-year-old boy: a case report. Presented is a unique case report of a rare bone tumor: a benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH) located in the posterior arch of C1 in a 6-year-old child.To describe a benign fibrous histiocytoma of bone and the differential diagnostic considerations based on the authors' case report.A BFH is a rare tumor composed of varying degree of fibroblast-like spindle cells, foam cells, and multinucleated giant cells. Approximately 86 cases have been reported in literature. Its exact nature remains somewhat controversial. A lesion may be designated a benign fibrous histiocytoma based on clinical, radiographic, and microscopic criteria.The clinical symptoms, plain radiographs, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance images (MRI), bone scintigraphy, and histologic section of the lesion are discussed, evaluated, and compared with other benign bone lesions.This case is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first benign fibrous histiocytoma to be reported in the cervical spine of a child. Various benign lesions such as nonossifying fibroma, giant-cell tumor, fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cyst, osteoblastoma, and eosinophilic granuloma are included in the differential diagnosis.Benign fibrous histiocytoma is a rare skeletal tumor. Because of this and its nonpathognomonic microscopic features, the diagnosis can be somewhat troublesome. However, by systematically reviewing patient's symptoms, tumor location, and radiographic and microscopic characteristics, other benign lesions can be eliminated. The diagnosis of a BFH is one of exclusion.
