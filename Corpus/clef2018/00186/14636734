Stress fractures of the lumbar pars interarticularis in athletes: a review based on long-term results of 18 professional cricketers. The physical demand of the modern game of cricket on the fast bowler is known to cause stress fractures of the lumbar spine. Between 1983 and 2001, we diagnosed pars interarticularis defects in 18 professional cricketers contracted to a single English County Cricket Club. Eight of these players were treated conservatively, with rest, supervised rehabilitation, bowling action analysis and re-education where necessary. The remaining 10 were treated operatively, 9 by Buck's repair of the spondylolytic lesion. All 18 players returned to professional sport.We recommend treatment of this select group of sportsmen in a unit consisting of a specialist physiotherapist, a bowling coach and a spinal surgeon. Should conservative measures fail, we recommend Buck's repair as the operation of choice.
