Flawed trial of micturition in cervical spinal cord injury patients: guidelines for trial of voiding in men with tetraplegia. A retrospective study.(1) To raise awareness of flawed trial of micturition (TOM) in male spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and (2) to present guidelines for trial of voiding in male SCI patients.Regional Spinal Injuries Centre, Southport, UK.Trial of micturition in male SCI patients refers to discarding indwelling catheters and establishing them on balanced voiding with penile sheath drainage. We describe seven SCI patients, whose trial of micturition was flawed.Two patients (C-6 and C-4 tetraplegia respectively) developed severe autonomic dysreflexia (headache, sweating, and increase in blood pressure) 2-3 h after removal of urethral catheter. A C-4 tetraplegic developed severe urinary infection after TOM. Four patients with tetraplegia started retaining increasing amounts of urine and developed urinary infections/autonomic dysreflexia/hydronephrosis 1-21 months after they were established on sheath drainage after TOM.During TOM, patients with cervical SCI could develop autonomic dysreflexia, urinary infection, or hold progressively increasing volumes of residual urine. TOM should be guided by videourodynamics. SCI patients need alpha-blockers, and anticholinergics if voiding pressures are >40-50 cm H(2)O. If high urethral resistances are found, sphincterotomy and/or bladder neck incision will help the patients to void by triggering. SCI patients, who had undergone successful TOM, require meticulous follow-up including urodynamics. Intermittent catheterisation without adequate medications based on cystometrogram may be hazardous, and may result in upper tract damage. Facilities for supplementary catheterisation (three to four times a day) should be available in the community if a patient is unable to maintain complete, low-pressure, emptying of bladder.
