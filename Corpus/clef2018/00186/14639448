Domain-specific satisfaction in adults with pediatric-onset spinal cord injuries. Interview using a structured questionnaire and standardized measures.To determine domain-specific satisfaction levels in adults with pediatric-onset spinal cord injuries (SCI), to determine factors associated with these levels of satisfaction, and to determine the relationship of domain-specific satisfaction to overall life satisfaction in this population.US and Canada.The participants were adults who sustained SCI at age 18 years or younger and were 24 years of age or older at the time of interview and did not have significant head injury. In addition to providing information about themselves, including education level, employment, marital status, and community participation, they were asked to rate their level of satisfaction in seven domains: transportation in the community, educational achievement, employment opportunities, income, social/recreational opportunities, dating opportunities, and sexual experience. They also completed the satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), the Craig handicap assessment and reporting technique, the functional independence measure, and the short-form-12 perceived health scale.A total of 216 individuals were interviewed. The mean age at injury was 14 years and the mean age at interview was 29 years. From most satisfied to least satisfied, the domains were ranked in the following order: satisfaction with transportation in the community, educational achievement, social and recreational opportunities, sexual experiences, dating opportunities, job opportunities, and income. Age at interview, gender, and perceived health were identified in regression analyses as predictors of some of the domain-specific satisfactions, but the primary predictive factors were in the area of participation. Neither severity of neurologic impairment nor level of functional independence were predictors for any of the domains. Satisfaction in each of the domains was significantly associated with SWLS and satisfaction with dating, job opportunities, education, and income were identified as predictive factors in a regression analysis.Dating opportunities, job opportunities, and income are the three domains in which adults with pediatric-onset SCI are least satisfied and those domains have a significant impact on overall satisfaction.
