Distances from the atlantal segment of the vertebral artery to the midline in children. There are scant data in the literature regarding distances from the midline to the suboccipital segment of the vertebral artery, and to our knowledge, none addressing this measurement in the pediatric population. This study seeks to establish age-related distances (Y) from the laterally placed vertebral artery to the midline at the level of the posterior arch of the atlas in children. Measurements from the midline to the most medial portion of the vertebral artery at the level of the posterior arch of the atlas were made in 50 children who underwent CT imaging of the cervical spine. For all left sides, Y = 12-23 mm (mean 17 mm). For all right sides, Y = 10-25 mm (mean 17.5 mm). For girls, Y = 12-16 mm (mean 12.7 mm) for left sides and Y = 12-25 mm (mean 18.5 mm) for right sides. For boys, Y = 12-20 mm (mean 16 mm) for left sides and Y = 10-21 mm (mean 16.7 mm) for right sides. We have found that the most medial portion of the vertebral artery from the midpoint of the posterior arch of the atlas for all ages was approximately 17 and 17.5 mm for left and right sides, respectively. This distance was generally less for left sides, except in the 16-19 years age group. However, as a group, this distance did not vary more than 2.8 mm between left and right sides. These data should assist the neurosurgeon who operates in the suboccipital region in children.
