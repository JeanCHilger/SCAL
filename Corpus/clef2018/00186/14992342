Functional electrical stimulation for augmented walking in adolescents with incomplete spinal cord injury. This study evaluated the effects of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to the muscles acting on the pelvis, hip, and knee on muscle strength, energy cost of walking, maximum walking distance and speed, step length and cadence, and joint kinematics during gait in 3 ambulatory adolescents with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).Percutaneous FES was used to strengthen weakened muscles and to augment walking. After training, participants walked as desired at home with FES for 1 year. Data were collected at baseline (preintervention), and with FES on and FES off immediately following the training period and with FES on and FES off at 3, 6, and 12 months posttraining.Voluntary strength improved in 12 out of 13 stimulated muscles. Decreased energy cost, increased maximum walking distance and speed, increased step length, and improved joint kinematics during gait were demonstrated with FES on and FES off.FES was able to achieve selective stimulation of key weakened muscles for augmented walking. The data suggest that FES had both direct and carryover effects.
