HWK-7 burst fracture in the cervical spine of a child with primary neurological impairment. Results of 1-year follow-up. We report about a 6-year-old female patient who sustained a cervical spine (C7) burst fracture with initial neurological impairment. The treatment in our department on the day of the trauma included corporectomy and replacement of the C7 body with a tricortical iliac bone graft. One year after the trauma we were able to see the patient again. The functional outcome was good. Due to the rare entity of this case and the difficulty of predicting progress we would like to present our treatment regime and the 1-year follow-up results.
