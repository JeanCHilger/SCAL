Traumatic brain and spinal cord injury. The management of pediatric head injuries has evolved over the past decade,and a number of significant advances have been made. Evidence-based guide-lines and algorithms for the management of severe pediatric head injuries have recently been published, and all pediatricians who care for children with severe head injuries should be familiar with these guidelines. It is hoped the guidelines will streamline the clinical management of these children and stimulate future research into the many areas that require further investigation.
