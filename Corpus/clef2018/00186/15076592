Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the cervical spine: a single institution experience in four patients. When Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) occurs at critical sites, such as in the cervical spine, there is a substantial risk for morbidity. Therefore, reports on clinical experiences with those patients remain important. We summarize the history of four patients with unifocal LCH at the cervical spine. All four patients received a biopsy to prove the histopathological diagnosis of LCH by demonstration of CD1a+cells. They were treated with oral prednisolone. All patients recovered completely and kept a normal function of the cervical spine. No reactivation of the disease occurred with an observation time of 3.4-7.3 years. This report contributes to the clinical experience for the treatment of LCH at critical sites.
