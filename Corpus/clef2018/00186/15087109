Neuroblastoma: an unusual presentation with bilateral ptosis. Neuroblastoma, a common tumor of neural crest origin, demonstrates an extremely variable clinical presentation and behavior. Paraspinal tumors may occur anywhere along the spinal column where they may invade the intervertebral foramina and produce cord compression. Cervical involvement may produce Horner's syndrome. Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is also a well-known neuroimmunologic finding of neuroblastoma. We report a 28-month-old female presenting with ptosis and muscle weakness, diagnosed as having a neuroblastoma.
