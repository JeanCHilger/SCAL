Surgical treatment of lumbosacral plexus injuries. The purpose of this study was to analyze therapeutic possibilities and clinical outcomes in patients with lumbosacral plexus injuries to develop surgical concepts of treatment.In a retrospective investigation 10 patients with injuries to the lumbosacral plexus were evaluated after surgery. The patients were assessed clinically, electrophysiologically, and based on the results of magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography myelography. In most patients a traction injury had occurred due to severe trauma that also caused pelvic fractures. In most cases the roots of the cauda equina of the lumbosacral plexus had ruptured. In cases of spinal root ruptures repair with nerve grafts were performed. In cases in which proximal stumps of the plexus could not be retrieved palliative nerve transfers by using lower intercostals nerves or fascicles from the femoral nerve were performed.Lesions of the proximal spinal nerves and cauda equina occur in the most serious lumbosacral plexus injuries. Patients with such injuries subjected to reconstruction of spinal nerves, repair of ventral roots in the cauda equina, and nerve transfers recovered basic lower-extremity functions such as unsupported standing and walking.
