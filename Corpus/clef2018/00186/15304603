An MT MRI study of the cervical cord in clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of MS. Cervical cord magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) histograms were obtained from 45 patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). The mean values of MTR histogram-derived metrics were not different between CIS patients and healthy control subjects or between patients with and without evidence of disease dissemination in time. Only three patients showed significantly lower cord MTR values than control subjects. These findings suggest the absence of intrinsic structural damage of the cervical cord soon after the onset of CIS suggestive of MS, even in those patients with an early evolution to MS.
