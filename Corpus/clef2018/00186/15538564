Functional outcome of burst fractures of the first lumbar vertebra managed surgically and conservatively. We retrospectively reviewed 31 neurologically intact patients with burst L1 fractures. We obtained a follow-up clinical evaluation after a mean of 43 (14-80) months from 26 patients--11 treated surgically and 15 managed non-surgically. Patients were assessed with regard to pain, employment status, recreational activities and overall satisfaction. At final follow-up of 15 patients managed non-surgically, six had little or no pain 12 had returned to work with six declaring little or no restrictions, and eight had returned to the same level of recreational activity as prior to injury with seven declaring little or no restrictions. Of 11 patients treated surgically, four had little or no pain
