Thoracic injuries associated with acute traumatic paraplegia of the upper and middle thoracic spine. The aim of this study was to analyse the number of thoracic injuries associated with acute traumatic paraplegia of the upper and middle thoracic spine and review the early management in respect to treatment standards.Using a prospective study protocol, data were sampled and analyzed from 12 December 2000 to 31 March 2002 at a level 1 trauma center.Twenty-two consecutive patients were included in the study. Sixteen suffered severe chest traumata. Lung contusion was diagnosed in 81%, followed by haemopneumothorax (75%) and fracture of the bony chest (75%). Intubation was performed 12 times in all. Chest drainage was performed in 14 patients. The mean duration of artificial ventilation was 20 days (range 2-93) and of intensive care treatment 25 days (range 2-93). Five patients died.Acute traumatic paraplegia of the upper and middle thoracic spine caused by high energy trauma is highly associated with severe chest trauma. Therefore, respiratory impairment must be kept in mind during the early treatment. If respiratory failure becomes more evident, emergency procedures such as intubation and chest drainage have to be performed. Secondary transfer should be avoided.
