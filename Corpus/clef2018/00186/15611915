3D-CT investigation of craniofacial and cervical spine anomalies in congenital muscular torticollis. To investigate the accompanied craniofacial and cervical spine anomalies in congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) with three-dimensional computerized tomography (3D-CT).We examined six cases of CMT. Cranial and cervical 3D CT was performed in all cases. Facial midline deviation angle (FDA), upper hemifacial width, lower hemifacial width (LHFW), length of hemimandible and zygomatic arcus, posterior hemicranial width (PHCW), anterior hemicranial width and cranial base midline deviation angle (CBDA) were measured on cranial 3D-CT images. Value of orbital index was calculated. Data achieved both ipsilaterally and contralaterally were compared with paired t-test. Atlanto-axial rotation angle (AARA) and atlantodental interval (ADI) values were measured on cervical 3D-CT images.Ages ranged between 2-26 years with a M/F ratio of 1/5. Facial asymmetry was diagnosed in all cases and LHFW was significantly undersized when compared to contralateral side (p < 0.05). FDA was measured 5.4+/-2.0 degrees on the average. Zygomatic arcus and hemimandible were significantly undersized on the side of torticollis (p < 0.05). Occipital plagiocephaly existed in all cases and PHCW was significantly extensive on torticollis side (p < 0.05). CBDA was measured 4.5+/-1.7 degrees on the average. Rotational movement of atlas over axis was observed in all cases where the AARA was 15.0+/-7.4 degrees. ADI was lesser than 3 mm in all cases.Even occipital plagiocephaly, maxillary and orbital deformity were commonly found in cases of CMT, most dominant asymmetry was observed in lower hemifacial region, zygomatic arcus and mandible by 3D-CT imaging. Rotational movement of first cervical vertebra over the second one was determined in all cases.
