Spinal exostoses: analysis of twelve cases and review of the literature. Retrospective review of spinal exostoses treated at our institution and literature review.Review of 12 cases of spinal exostoses treated at our institution compared with 165 cases of spinal exostoses reported in the literature.Spinal exostoses are uncommon. Most reports consist of 1 to 3 cases. The relationship between solitary exostoses and those associated with multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE), as well as the incidence of intraspinal and extraspinal location, symptoms presentation, and results of treatment are unclear.The medical records, operative reports, and diagnostic imaging of 12 patients with spinal exostoses treated at our institution between 1972 and 2002 were reviewed. The literature was reviewed using MEDLINE search of English literature and bibliographies of published manuscripts.Solitary spinal exostoses were more common than those associated with MHE. Lesions were most common in the upper cervical spine and originated from the posterior elements. Patients with exostoses associated with MHE were significantly younger and had a higher incidence of symptoms consistent with neural structure compression than patients with solitary exostoses. Complete excision resulted in resolution of preoperative symptoms. Intralesional excision resulted in recurrence in all cases.Spinal exostoses are more common than reported previously. Patients with MHE that present with back pain or neurological symptoms should produce a high index of suspicion. Evaluation should include both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to define the origin of the exostosis and the presence of neural structure compression. Surgical excision should be preformed en bloc.
