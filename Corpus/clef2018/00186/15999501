Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children. SCIWORA is a syndrome occurring when the spinal cord sustains neural damage during a traumatic event without positive radiographic findings. Anatomic characteristics of the pediatric spine place children at risk for this injury. The injury occurs through extreme flexion, hyperextension, longitudinal distraction or ischemic damage to the spinal cord. Diagnosis is based on MRI findings. Timely diagnosis and stabilization is key to optimizing the child's recovery. Nursing care and evaluation of these children goes beyond the ABCs of resuscitation focusing on astute neurological examination.
