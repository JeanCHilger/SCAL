Transient traumatic spinal venous hypertensive myelopathy. We present a case of a reversible spinal venous hypertensive myelopathy that occurred following a traumatic mediastinal hematoma. The mediastinal hematoma caused compression of the brachiocephalic vein, resulting in elevation of the venous pressures that ultimately resulted in dilation of the epidural venous plexus and spinal cord edema. The secondary neurologic deficits were the culmination of venous outflow obstruction at the level of the spinal cord that resolved on the resolution of the mediastinal hematoma.
