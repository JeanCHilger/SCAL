Surgical treatment of acute type II and rostral type III odontoid fractures managed by anterior screw fixation. In the present study, the authors comment on their experience with anterior odontoid screw fixation in the management of odontoid fractures, in an attempt to further assess the safety and the efficacy of this procedure.A retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients with reducible type II or rostral type III odontoid fractures, operated at our hospital with anterior odontoid screw fixation. Radiographic bony fusion, complications, and clinical outcome were evaluated.Solid bony fusion was evident in 38 (90.5%) of the patients. One mechanical instrumentation-related complication occurred, without clinical significance. No other major complications related to the procedure were noted. A satisfactory range of motion in the cervical spine was observed in all patients.Anterior odontoid screw fixation is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of type II and rostral type III odontoid fractures. Compliance to the specific indications and contraindications of this operation is crucial for optimal outcome.
