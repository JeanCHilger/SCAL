Cranial and cervical vertebral mycetoma. Report of three cases. Mycetomas inflammatory-like tumors presenting as fistulas found in the skin and soft tissues. Inoculation, generally in tropical areas, occurs by skin injury. The foot is the main infection site. Other uncommon infection sites include the cranial and cervical areas which are rare. We present three cases of cranial and cervical mycetoma. Clinical sign were dominated by headache, cervical pain and cervico-occipital tumefaction with formation of pus and granules (red in two cases, black in one). A motor deficit was noted in one patient. Radiographic examinations including CT scan showed extensive mass lesions, associated with bone destruction. Laboratory tests identified Leptospheria senegalensis in one patient and Actinomadura pelletieri in two. A medicosurgical procedure was performed. The course was unfavourable in one patient. Several factors are important for treating such infections: early diagnosis, improvement of the social and economic environment, use of new drugs.
