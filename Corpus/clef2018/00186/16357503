Neurenteric cyst of the upper cervical spine: excision via posterior approach. Neurenteric cyst of the cervical spine is an uncommon congenital lesion and usually associated with many craniocervical anomalies. Solitary neurenteric cyst of the upper cervical spine is very rare. Surgery is the main treatment method. An 11-year-old female child presented with the symptoms of neck pain that radiated to both shoulders and arms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the patient showed a cystic mass lesion ventral to the spinal cord and lying at the level from C1 to C3. She underwent surgical resection via a posterior approach and complete cyst resection was performed. Although removal of a neurenteric cyst through a posterior approach may result in spinal cord injury, this method is easier and safer than the anterior approach, especially in children.
