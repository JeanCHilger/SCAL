Uvulo-glosso-pharyngeal dimensions in different anteroposterior skeletal patterns. The aim of this study was to investigate the uvulo-glosso-pharyngeal dimensions in subjects with different anteroposterior jaw relationship. Cephalometric radiograph of 90 subjects (45 females and 45 males, aged 14-17 years) were divided into three groups according to the ANB angle, ie, group 1, skeletal Class I (ANB angle 1-5) group 2, skeletal Class II (ANB angle >5)
