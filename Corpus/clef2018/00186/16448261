Correlation of skeletal maturation stages determined by cervical vertebrae and hand-wrist evaluations. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the Fishman maturation prediction method (FMP) and the cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) method for skeletal maturation stage determination. Hand-wrist and lateral cephalograms from 79 subjects (52 females and 27 males) were used. Hand-wrist radiographs were analyzed using the FMP to determine skeletal maturation level (advanced, average, or delayed) and stage (relative position of the individual in the pubertal growth curve). Cervical vertebrae (C2, C3, and C4) outlines obtained from lateral cephalograms were analyzed using the CVM to determine skeletal maturation stage. Intraexaminer reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) for both methods was calculated from 10 triplicate hand-wrist and lateral cephalograms from the same patients. An ICC coefficient of 0.985 for FMP and an ICC of 0.889 for CVM were obtained. A Spearman correlation value of 0.72 (P < .001) was found between the skeletal maturation stages of both methods. When the sample was subgrouped according to skeletal maturation level, the following correlation values were found: for early mature adolescents 0.73, for average mature adolescents 0.70, and for late mature adolescents 0.87. All these correlation values were statistically different from zero (P < .024). Correlation values between both skeletal maturation methods were moderately high. This may be high enough to use either of the methods indistinctively for research purposes but not for the assessment of individual patients. Skeletal level influences the correlation values and, therefore, it should be considered whenever possible.
