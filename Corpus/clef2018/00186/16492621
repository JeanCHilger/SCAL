The perception of pain and pain-related cognitions in subacute whiplash-associated disorders: its influence on prolonged disability. To clarify the relations between the sensory, affective and cognitive dimensions of pain and to analyse what influence these components have on persistent disability in patients with subacute whiplash-associated disorders (WAD).The data was obtained from an on-going randomised controlled trial (RCT) on 47 patients. The sensory dimension of pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) diary and a Painometer. The affective dimension was assessed using the Painometer. The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) were used as measures of pain-related cognitions. The Pain Disability Index (PDI) was used as the outcome measure.Forty patients (85%) completed the trial. The correlations between the sensory and affective dimensions of pain were non-significant, which indicates that they are two independent constructs that describe various dimensions of whiplash-related pain. High pain intensity and pain affect, more widespread pain, and high fear of movement/(re)injury corresponded to low self-efficacy. Multiple regression analyses showed that self-efficacy was the most important predictor of persistent disability contributing to 42% of the variation in the PDI score.The treatment approach for patients with subacute WAD should incorporate the multidimensional nature of pain and to prevent disability special effort should be made to enhance the patient's self-efficacy beliefs.
