Extradural thoracic arachnoid cyst. Case report and review of the literature. To report an unusual and asymptomatic cause of cord compression treated surgically with good clinical outcome.We report a case of extradural arachnoid cyst in the thoracic region and review the literature on the clinical, neuroradiologic and therapeutic features.A 17-year-old man, with unremarkable past medical history was referred to our institution of Neurosurgery, CHU Mohammed-VI, Marrakech, with progressive spastic paraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a posterior extradural cystic lesion in the thoracic region from T6-T7 thoracic vertebra. The cyst was completely removed by posterior approach. An arachnoid cyst was confirmed at the histological study. Neurological symptoms improved after surgery.Given its infrequency, the diagnosis of arachnoid cyst should be suspected when a cystic lesion causes cord compression. Surgery is the treatment of choice, providing good clinical outcome.
