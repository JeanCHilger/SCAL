Inadvertent intrathecal cannulation in an infant, demonstrated by three-dimensional computed tomography: a rare complication of internal jugular vein catheterization. We describe a case of inadvertent intrathecal cannulation with a central venous catheter in an infant, confirmed by three-dimensional computed tomography, which clearly demonstrated the track of the catheter. We believe that this complication could have been related to two major factors: depth of needle insertion and penetration of the vein by a straight-tip guidewire. To avoid this complication, the depth of needle insertion must be carefully checked, a "J"-tipped rather than a straight-tipped guidewire should be used, and puncture should be guided by ultrasound.
