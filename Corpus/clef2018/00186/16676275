Central neuropathic pain and its relation to the quality of life of a person with a traumatic spinal cord injury. To conduct an exploratory cross-sectional study carried out in the city of Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil) with the aim of evaluating the relation between central neuropathic pain and the quality of life in individuals with central neuropathic pain due to traumatic injury.The study examined the cases of 17 adult paraplegic patients with complete traumatic injuries, mainly due to perforations caused by gunshot wounds. The sample was divided into two groups: 1) those with pain, and 2) those with intense pain (more than 20 points according to McGill and eight on the numerical visual scale). The instruments used were the following: the MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the McGill pain questionnaire, oriented towards the descriptors and the numerical visual scale.The quality of life of patients with central neuropathic pain due to a spinal cord injury is greatly compromised and when the pain is intense the quality of life is even more effected, especially in the following areas: "functional capacity" (p = 0.005), "general state of health" (p = 0.003), "mental health" (p = 0.035), "social aspects" (p = 0.006) and "pain" (p = 0.003).The quality of life in patients with neuropathic pain due to a traumatic spinal cord injury is severely compromised and the more intense this pain is, the greater its effect on the quality of life will be. It can also be stated that the instruments used were valid for this type of patients (in spite of certain shortcomings) given the complexity and subjectivity of the matter.
