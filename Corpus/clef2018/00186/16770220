Two cases of odontoid fracture in preschool children. Halo application is a standard method for cervical immobilization. However, complications may occur in children because of their thin skull and immature bone. The authors report two cases of odontoid fracture in preschool children treated with a Minerva cast. Two 4-year-old children sustained displaced odontoid fractures in motor vehicle accidents. The fractures were immediately reduced and immobilized using a Minerva cast, followed by the application of a soft collar. By the 1-year follow-up, uneventful bone union had occurred, and the children were able to attend preschool with minimal or no neurologic deficits. The Minerva cast is a classic, inexpensive method of cervical immobilization and is still useful for this kind of fracture. Immediate reduction and immobilization with a Minerva cast is a viable option for displaced odontoid fractures in preschool children.
