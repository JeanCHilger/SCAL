Functional electrical stimulation reinforced tenodesis effect controlled by myoelectric activity from wrist extensors. We demonstrated a method for enhancing the tenodesis grip in individuals with sustained tetraplegia at the 6th cervical vertebra neurological level. Subjects used the myoelectric activity from wrist extensor muscles to directly control the electrical stimulation of the extrinsic finger and thumb flexors (flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum superficialis/ profondus) with the use of a specially designed system, Myoelectrically Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (MeCFES). We screened 20 medical records and selected 9 subjects. Of the nine subjects, five showed a positive response to the surface stimulation and could test the system the other four failed to achieve functional finger flexion because of skin sensitivity or inadequate movement. We evaluated hand function, with and without the MeCFES system, using tests involving three everyday objects: manipulating a videocassette with the key grip, drinking from a bottle with the palmar grasp, and writing with a pen using the tripod grip. Without the system, none of the five subjects could complete all three tasks
