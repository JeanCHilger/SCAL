Management of blunt tracheal trauma in children: a case series and review of the literature. Blunt tracheal trauma seldom develops in children because of their anatomy and the mobility of the cartilage. It has the potential to be overlooked, either because of the severity of concomitant injuries or because of the unfamiliarity of paediatricians with this type of injury. However, tracheal injury might be lethal due to airway compromise. Early bronchoscopy may be necessary to anticipate complications and prevent permanent dysfunction. We present a retrospective, double-institution case series over a 5-year period, describing five children, aged 3 to 14 years, with tracheal injury after blunt cervical trauma. All patients showed emphysema with pneumomediastinum. After explorative bronchoscopy, all patients were successfully treated with antibiotics and/or supportive ventilation. In summary, minimal lesions due to blunt tracheal trauma could be treated conservatively in children. Since the external signs of tracheal injury are not indicative of the extent of the trauma, a high index of suspicion is warranted in these patients.
