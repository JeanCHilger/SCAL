Bezier surface reformation: an original visualization technique of cervical nerve roots on myelographic CT. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of an original reformation method of cervical myelographic computed tomography (CT) using the Bezier surface technique.Presurgical myelographic computed tomography (CT) scans using a multidetector row CT scanner were performed in 25 patients with avulsion injury of the cervical nerve roots. Each volumetric data set was reformatted using Bezier surface technique to depict the individual nerve root in a single image. In the reformatted images, visualization of the dorsal and ventral nerve roots between C4 and T1 on the uninjured side (300 nerves) was rated.Bezier surface reformation (BSR) images depicted the dorsal and the ventral nerve roots between C4 and C8 in 125 (100%) and 125 (100%) of 125 nerves, respectively. The dorsal and the ventral nerve roots of T1 were depicted in 25 (100%) and 22 (88%) in 25 nerves, respectively.The BSR technique of cervical myelographic CT enables simultaneous display of multiple cervical nerve roots in one image. BSR is a feasible technique for the assessment of the cervical nerve roots.
