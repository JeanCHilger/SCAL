The diagnosis and treatment of back pain in children and adolescents: an update. The conditions described for the most part are diagnosed by characteristic history, comprehensive physical examination, and selective laboratory and imaging studies. Most can be treated by nonoperative means. With the exception of tumors, surgical intervention is performed only after a thorough trial of conservative management. Should the diagnosis remain elusive or response to treatment less than expected, orthopedic referral is encouraged.
