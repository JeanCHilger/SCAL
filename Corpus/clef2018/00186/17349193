Cervical vertebral bone age during puberty. To explore a method for objectively and accurately evaluating cervical vertebral bone age among Chinese growing subjects.Using cephalometric and hand-wrist radiographs of 90 boys and 90 girls who were during pubertal period, we measured the third and fourth cervical vertebral bodies and calculated hand bone age using Liaokawa's method. A formula for calculating cervical vertebral bone age was determined by stepwise multiple regression analysis.A method for objectively evaluating cervical vertebral bone age among Chinese growing subjects during pubertal period was established. Y (Y: cervical vertebral bone age) = -20.189 + 24.666X(1) (X(1): AH(4)/AP) +46.468X(2) (X(2): AH(3)/AP(3)) +39.854X(3) (X(3): AH(4)/H) (r = 0.901). The R square of the equation was 0.81. The mean and standard deviation were as follows: constant = -20.19 +/- 4.89 (t = -4.13, P < 0.01), AH(4)/AP(4) = 24.67 +/- 8.32 (t = 2.97, P < 0.01), AH(3)/AP(3) = 46.47 +/- 6.60 (t = 7.04, P < 0.01), AH(4)/H(4) = 39.85 +/- 7.04 (t = 5.66, P < 0.01).This method could be used to evaluate Chinese growth stages objectively.
