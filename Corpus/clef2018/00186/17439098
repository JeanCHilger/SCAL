Remodelling potential of paediatric cervical spine after type II odontoid peg fracture. We describe a case of odontoid process fracture below the synchondrosis associated with delayed diagnosis and anterior subluxation of C1 over C2. This was treated with an in situ posterior occipitocervical fusion. Long-term follow-up of 7 years showed excellent remodelling of the deformity.
