Hemangiopericytoma of thoracic spine: a rare bony tumor. We report the case of a 16-year-old girl who developed hemangiopericytoma of the thoracic spine the main clinical symptoms were of spastic paraparesis with sensory involvement and uro-fecal incontinence. She was initially put on antitubercular treatment keeping in mind the endemicity of tuberculosis in the region. When she deteriorated on conservative management, she was operated upon, and the histopathological report was suggestive of hemangiopericytoma.Additional immunocytochemistry was performed in the paraffin-embedded tumor sections.An extremely rare case of primary epidural malignant hemangiopericytoma of the thoracic spinal column is described. It is a rare tumor, which is locally aggressive, and a potentially malignant tumor. The tumor is more commonly found in the cranium, and spinal involvement is rare, and only few case reports could be retrieved from the literature. We discuss the clinical profile, management, and outcome of spinal hemangiopericytomas along with pertinent review of the literature.
