Case report 694: Cervical paravertebral circumscribed myositis ossificans. MO is a soft-tissue mass, reported only 3 times in the cervical paravertebral area in a search of the literature. We describe an additional case in a 10-year-old girl. We emphasize that in the unusual radial radiopaque roentgenographic image, a malignant tumor could be considered. We also stress that CT scanning can be of great value in establishing the diagnosis. The clinical types and the radiological and pathological features of MO are described in some detail and the "zonal" sign is described.
