Aplication of the stereolithography technique in complex spine surgery. Many techniques have been proposed for surgical training as a learning process for young surgeons or for the simulation of complex procedures. Stereolithograpfy, a rapid prototyping technique, has been presented recently as an option for these purposes. We describe the case of a 12 years old boy, diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma in the cervical spine. After a surgical simulation accomplished in the prototype, built by stereolithography, the patient was submitted to a C4 corpectomy and to a C4 and C3 laminectomy with anterior and posterior fixation, a non intercurrence procedure. This technique is an innovative and complementary tool in diagnosis and therapy. As a result, it is easier for the surgeon to understand the complexity of the case and plan the approach before any surgical procedure.
