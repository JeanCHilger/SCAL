Rapid orthodontic extrusion of crown root and cervical root fractured teeth. This study concerns the relapse tendency and extent of root resorption in 33 extruded non-vital crown root fractured or cervical root fractured teeth in 32 patients 10-20 years old. They constitute all orthodontically extruded teeth at the Orthodontic or Pedodontic Departments, Eastman Institutet, Stockholm (1982-1987). A simple extrusion mechanism exerted a force of 60-70 p along the root axis of the tooth. An extrusion of 2-3 mm was obtained in most patients the most extreme effect was 6 mm. In 16 patients the extrusion was achieved within 3 weeks, in 12 it lasted for 4-6 weeks and in 5, 7-9 weeks. The treatment was more complicated in the lower jaw. After the extrusion, a fibrotomy was done and in most patients also a gingival recontouring to create an optimal relation between the gingiva and the margin of the restoration. Periodically identical radiographs were taken immediately before and after the extrusion, after 3 months and after 1 year. A minor relapse, about 0.5 mm, was observed in 3 patients. Limited root resorption was found in 6 teeth and severe in only 1. The resorptions did not progress in the following 2 years of observation.
