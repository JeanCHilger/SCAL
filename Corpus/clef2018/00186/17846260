Efficacy and safety of tadalafil in men with erectile dysfunction following spinal cord injury. To determine the efficacy and safety of tadalafil when taken on demand by men with erectile dysfunction (ED) secondary to traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose-titration, parallel-group study in clinical practices in Europe. Patients Enrolled patients had ED secondary to SCI (all spinal levels) and sustained 6 months or longer before visit 1.After a 4-week run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to tadalafil, 10 mg, (n = 142) or placebo (n = 44) for a 12-week, on-demand treatment period with assessments at 4-week intervals. The dose of tadalafil was maintained or titrated (10 or 20 mg) at 4 and 8 weeks.Efficacy was measured using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP), and Global Assessment Question (GAQ). Treatment-emergent adverse events and vital signs were collected at each visit.Mean age was 38 years. Mean baseline IIEF erectile function domain score was 13.4, and following 12 weeks of treatment, 22.6 for tadalafil and 13.6 for placebo (P < .001). After treatment, the tadalafil group compared with the placebo group was significantly greater (P < .001) in mean per-patient percentage of successful penetration attempts (SEP question 2 75.4% vs 41.1%) and intercourse attempts (SEP question 3Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) improved erectile function and was well tolerated by men with ED secondary to traumatic SCI.
