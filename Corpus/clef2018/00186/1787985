Post-traumatic spinal cord cysts evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. In order to determine a more accurate prevalence of post-traumatic spinal cord cysts (PTSCC) in spinal cord injured (SCI) patients, we retrospectively reviewed magnetic resonance scans from symptomatic imaging and asymptomatic SCI patients. We found the incidence of PTSCC to be 51% in our patient population. The only symptom that correlated to the presence of a cyst was spasticity. The cyst develops at the site of injury and appears to be a common sequela of SCI. We believe that conservative treatment is indicated in most patients with a PTSCC.
