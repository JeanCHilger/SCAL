Computed tomographic angiography for the diagnosis of blunt carotid/vertebral artery injury: a note of caution. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) by 16-channel multidetector scanner is increasingly replacing conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for diagnosing or excluding blunt carotid/vertebral injuries (BCVI). To date there has been only 1 study in which all patients received both examinations. That study reported a high accuracy for 16-detector CTA. The current prospective parallel comparative study aims at validating this high accuracy and examining the rates of evaluability of CTA performed with a 16-detector scanner with image reconstruction by modern imaging software.Patients at risk for BCVI (facial/cervical-spinal fractures unexplained neurologic deficitDuring the 40-month study period ending March 2007, approximately 7000 blunt trauma patients were evaluated and of these 119 (1.7%) consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria were screened by CTA. Ninety-two patients underwent confirmatory DSA. Twenty-three (22%) DSA identified 26 BCVI (vertebral, 13 carotid, 13). Among these 23 CTAs, 17 identified 19 BCVIs (vertebral, 10Current CTA technology cannot reliably diagnose or exclude BCVI. Twenty percent of CTAs are either nonevaluable or suboptimal. Until more data are available and the technique is standardized, the current trend towards using CTA to screen for and/or diagnose these rare but potentially devastating injuries is dangerous.
