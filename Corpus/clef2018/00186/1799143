CNS involvement in Ewing's sarcoma. A report of 12 cases. Ewing's sarcoma is one of the malignant bone tumours, which occurs in various bones of the body. When the spinal column or skull bones are involved, it may cause spinal cord compression or brain invasion. In this study, 12 cases of Ewing's sarcoma with central nervous system (CNS) involvement are presented. Seven of them were male and five female. In seven of the cases tumoural mass was located in the spinal column, whereas in the others it was found in the cranium. The major complaints were motor weakness in the lower extremities in seven cases, and a mass on the cranial vault in four cases. On neurological examination, eight of the patients had impairment of movements of the extremities (67%), and seven had sensory loss (58%). All except one patient underwent surgery. In seven cases, decompressive laminectomy plus subtotal tumour excision was performed, in three, craniectomy with grossly total tumour excision, and in one, biopsy. In this report, age and sex distribution, complaints, clinical and laboratory findings, neurological examination, and histopathology of our cases are reviewed and surgical results are compared with others reported in the literature.
