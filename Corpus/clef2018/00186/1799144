Fracture of the lumbar vertebral ring apophysis imitating disc herniation. Three cases of fracture of the lumbar ring apophysis representing type I, II, and III are described in detail and the natural history of these fractures is discussed. The symptoms of apophyseal fractures are usually low back pain, sciatica, tension signs, and neurological deficits, thus imitating the symptoms of lumbar disc herniation. Plain radiography and magnetic resonance are often inconclusive and computed tomography is essential for the true diagnosis. An explanation of the different types of fractures, based on the osteogenesis of the human vertebra, is proposed. Recognition of these fractures is essential for proper planing of surgery, and apophyseal ring fractures must be suspected when children and young adults show signs of lumbar disc herniation.
