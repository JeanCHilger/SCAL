A hypoplastic atlas and long odontoid process in a girl manifesting phenotypic features resembling spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia joint laxity syndrome. Phenotypic features consistent but not completely diagnostic for spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia joint laxity (SEMDJL) were encountered in a 7-year-old-girl. Additional tomographic features of a hypoplastic atlas (assimilation of the posterior arch of the atlas) and unduly long odontoid process were seen. We report what might be a novel type of SEMDJL.
