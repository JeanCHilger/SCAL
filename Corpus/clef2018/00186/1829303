Dislocation fracture with transverse spinal lesion caused by a seat belt injury in infant. A 21 month old child suffered from a luxation fracture L 1/2 with a complete paraplegia caused by an incorrect used car fastened seat belt. After operative reduction and stabilisation with Harrington-implants there was a slow but nearly complete recovery of sensible and motor functions. Three years after the accident there is only a low grade deformity in the upper lumber spine.
