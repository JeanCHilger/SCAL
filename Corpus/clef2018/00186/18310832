Imaging features in Hirayama disease. To evaluate the MR findings in clinically suspected cases of Hirayama disease.The pre and post contrast neutral and flexion position cervical MR images of eight patients of clinically suspected Hirayama disease were evaluated for the following findings: localized lower cervical cord atrophy, asymmetric cord flattening, abnormal cervical curvature, loss of attachment between the posterior dural sac and subjacent lamina, anterior shifting of the posterior wall of the cervical dural canal and enhancing epidural component with flow voids. The distribution of the above features in our patient population was noted and correlated with their clinical presentation and electromyography findings.Although lower cervical cord atrophy was noted in all eight cases of suspected Hirayama disease, the rest of the findings were variably distributed with asymmetric cord flattening, abnormal cervical curvature, anterior shifting of the posterior wall of the cervical dural canal and enhancing epidural component seen in six out of eight (75%) cases. An additional finding of thoracic extension of the enhancing epidural component was also noted in five out of eight cases.Dynamic post contrast MRI evaluation of cervicothoracic spine is an accurate method for the diagnosis of Hirayama disease.
