Low back pain in the adolescent athlete. Low back pain is a common problem among young athletes. These individuals are at risk for significant structural injuries or nonmechanical problems that can be associated with their symptoms. Any athlete who has severe, persisting, or activity-limiting symptoms must be evaluated thoroughly. Clinicians must have a working knowledge of the developmental issues, injury patterns, and particular conditions that may affect a given athlete and be able to work with patients in addition to families, coaches, trainers, and others involved in the care and training of the injured athlete.
