Femoral fracture in patients with spinal cord injury. Femoral fractures during the physical therapy in two patients with spinal cord injury and consequent osteoporosis in the paralyzed limbs are reported. The fractures were caused by a minor trauma and the spasticity was considered to be an additional factor in the accident. During the physical therapy the patients were seated with hip abduction and flexion of the knee. It is important that the patients participate in a program of physiotherapy. This, however, should be performed under strict control.
