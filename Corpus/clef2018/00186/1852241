Phrenic stimulation in respiratory paralysis caused by spinal cord injuries. Phrenic stimulation is reserved for the rare patients with central neurogenic apnea due to isolated upper spinal cord injuries. Presenting a series of ten cases the authors describe the indications for phrenic stimulation, the technique of implantation and the conditions for diaphragmatic training by the use of stimulation by low frequency trains allowing for an increase in the number of low muscular fibers. The continuation of accompanying neurological rehabilitation and nursing of these severely handicapped patients is not to be neglected because of the length of the training protocole as the aim is their return home. This technique, therefore, seems particularly suitable for application in a few specialized centers where research for material totally implantable and adapted to the physiological requirements of the patient can be conducted parallel to treatment.
