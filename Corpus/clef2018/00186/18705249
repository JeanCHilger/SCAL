Profile of compressive myelopathy as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. To evaluate spectrum of diseases causing compressive myelopathy and accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing these conditions, a total of 69 clinically diagnosed cases of compressive myelopathy were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and results were tabulated. Caries spine was the commonest condition (24.6%) followed by metastasis spine (17.4%), ossified posterior longitudinal ligament (7.8%), primary bone tumours, nerve sheath tumours, intramedullary tumours and rare conditions like epidural abscess, spontaneous epidural haematoma, subdural haematoma, epidural lipomatosis, etc. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for diagnosing caries by magnetic resonance imaging was found to be 94%, 98% and 97% while that of metastasis spine was 91%, 98% and 97% respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for diagnosing compressive myelopathy.
