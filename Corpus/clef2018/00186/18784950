Aneurysmal bone cyst of the cervical spine (2008:7b). Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) are rare, benign, but locally destructive bone tumors. They occur in the spine in 14% of cases, but only 2% are found in the cervical spine. This case report presents a 16-year-old female with an expansive aneurysmatic bone cyst with extensive bone destruction and instability in the cervical segments C1 and C2. In CT and MRI, there was a soft-tissue tumor mass with multiple cysts and fluid-fluid levels within these cysts, as well as contrast enhancement of the cyst wall and the tissue among the cysts. The typical macroscopic and histological findings were present. The tumor was resected en bloc, after which the patient underwent adjuvant radiation therapy. The patient made a complete recovery.
