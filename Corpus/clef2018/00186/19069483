Clinical features and combined treatment of the central nervous system in Hodgkin's disease. Spinal cord compression was diagnosed in 33 patients with Hodgkin's disease. Specific involvement of the brain was identified in 17 cases of dissemination relapse. Timely use of cytostatic and/or radiotherapy resulted in sustained and complete recovery of the spinal cord. The results in cases of sustained spinal disorders were worse. Tumor-induced specific changes in the brain and spinal cord compression had worse prognosis and median of survival from time of tumor detection was approx. 12 months. In patients with spinal cord compression or cerebral involvement and with concomitant neurologic symptoms, sustained response after chemotherapy with derivatives of nitrosourea (nitrosomethylurea, lomustine and carmustine) (CCNU-OPP, NVPP/NOPP, DVCPP) was (59%) and (64%), respectively. Adequate polychemotherapy with nitrosourea and radiotherapy derivatives and surgery, if required, can improve the efficacy of treatment of Hodgkin's disease patients with spinal cord compression.
