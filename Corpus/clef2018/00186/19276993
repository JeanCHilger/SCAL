Vertebrectomy of giant cell tumor with vertebral artery embolization: case report. Giant cell tumors (GCT) are rare in the cervical spine in adolescent children. This tumor is histologically benign, but there is a high recurrence rate. Although surgical resection of GCT arising in the cervical spine is commonly regarded as recommended treatment method, it is still a challenge to achieve satisfactory results. The authors describe a case of a patient of adolescent age with a GCT in the cervical spine. It was necessary to study the embolization of the vertebral artery to planning the vertebrectomy surgery for resection of the entire tumor to avoid recurrence. The resection of the tumor was carried out by combined access (anteriorly and posteriorly) and was stabilized with plate, posterior lateral mass screws, and autologous iliac crest graft.
