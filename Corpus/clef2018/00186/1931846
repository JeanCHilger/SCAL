Traumatic spinal cord injury: unusual recovery in 3 children. We report on 3 children with traumatic spinal cord injury. All of them had normal x-rays of the vertebral column. There were no abnormalities of the spinal cord in myelography or magnetic resonance imaging. Although these situations are often associated with a poor neurological prognosis, we observed very unusual recoveries in these 3 cases.
