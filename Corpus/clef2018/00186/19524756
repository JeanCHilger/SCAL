Blunt posterior tracheal laceration and esophageal injury in a child. Blunt force trauma to the neck can result in the unusual injury pattern of laceration of the posterior tracheal wall in combination with esophageal injury. We present the report of a 10-year-old child who had blunt cervical trauma because of a bicycle accident and subsequently presented with profound subcutaneous emphysema. This case was addressed with operative management with a good result. The essential management principles for this rare constellation of injuries include a high index of suspicion, early control of the airway, endoscopic and radiographic diagnosis, and use of a buttressing strap muscle flap in the event of operative management to prevent delayed complications, including leak and tracheoesophageal fistula.
