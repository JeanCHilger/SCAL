Multidetector row computed tomography of the injured larynx after trauma. Laryngeal trauma is rare and can occur as an isolated injury or as part of multitrauma. On the basis of airway patency, it is decided whether the patient needs rapid surgical intervention or whether the patient would profit from preoperative imaging done with multidetector row multislice thin section computed tomography with multiplanar reconstruction in the soft-tissue and bone window setting. Grading the fracture pattern from minor isolated to multiple dislocated fracture lines helps to plan individual treatment options and to prevent long-term voice complications.
