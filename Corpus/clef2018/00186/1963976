Mathematical modeling and taxonomic evaluation of the indices and degree of rehabilitation in 2 types of the treatment of patients with sequelae of spinal cord injuries. The authors characterize spinal cord traumatic disease (SCTD) and methods of the taxonomic evaluation of the index (IR) and degree of rehabilitation (DR), which allow the control over the efficacy of the treatment of patients suffering from SCTD. The IR and DR of two treatment types are compared in two groups of patients with SCTD (n-153, 47 controls). The method suggested makes it possible to accurately control the IR and DR of each patient with SCTD as well as to use the findings obtained for elaborating the program of rehabilitation of patients with SCTD and for computer-based analysis.
