A randomized controlled trial on the effects of cycling with and without electrical stimulation on cardiorespiratory and vascular health in children with spinal cord injury. To examine the cardiorespiratory/vascular effects of cycling with and without functional electrical stimulation (FES) in children with spinal cord injury (SCI).Randomized controlled trial.Pediatric referral hospital.Children with SCI (N=30), ages 5 to 13 years, with injury levels from C4 to T11, and American Spinal Injury Association grades A, B, or C.Children were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: FES leg cycling exercise, passive leg cycling, or noncycling control group receiving electrical stimulation therapy. After receiving instruction on the use of the equipment, children exercised for 1 hour 3 times per week for 6 months at home with parental supervision.Oxygen uptake (Vo(2)) during an incremental arm ergometry test, resting heart rate, forced vital capacity, and a fasting lipid profile.There were no differences (P>.05) between groups after 6 months of exercise when comparing pre- and postvalues. However, there were differences between groups for some variables when examining percent change. The FES cycling group showed an improvement (P=.035) in Vo(2) (16.2%+/-25.0%) as compared with the passive cycling group (-28.7%+/-29.1%). For lipid levels, the electrical stimulation-only group showed declines (P=.032) in cholesterol levels (-17.1%+/-8.5%) as compared with the FES cycling group (4.4%+/-20.4%).Cycling with FES led to gains in Vo(2), whereas electrical stimulation alone led to improvements in cholesterol.
