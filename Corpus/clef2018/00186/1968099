Acquired maxillofacial defects from motor vehicle accidents: statistics and prosthodontic considerations. Trauma from motor vehicle accidents is one of the leading causes of death in the United States moreover, the costs related to personal harm are only second to cancer. Head and neck injuries predominate and involve contact with the vehicle's interior (80%), contact with the vehicle's exterior (12%), or noncontact with the vehicle (8%). The patient with maxillofacial defects resulting from motor vehicle accident will have numerous soft tissue and hard tissue injuries ranging from neurologic involvement to fractures and/or avulsions of the temporomandibular joint, maxillae, mandible, teeth, and supporting structures. Tooth avulsions, pulpitis, and fractures without pulpitis have been found in a 4:2:1 ratio. The prosthodontist plays an important team role by anticipating the increased functional demands that may be placed on the required prostheses and by anticipating the preprosthetic procedures and counseling that may be necessary to assist in the total treatment.
