Multiple trauma in pediatric patients. Important prerequisites to adequately treat pediatric patients with multiple trauma are a profound knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of injury, common injury patterns and the associated mortality. The younger the child the more injury patterns as well as organ-specific injury severity differ in comparison to adult trauma patients. Traumatic brain and thorax injuries are the key to the prognosis of the injured child. Abdominal injuries rarely require surgery in contrast to adults. Spine and pelvic injuries as well as injuries of the extremities make age-adapted surgical procedures mandatory. The present article describes the established primary diagnostic evaluation after admittance to the emergency room as well as specific treatment options for particular organ systems with respect to age-specific anatomical characteristics and pitfalls in children.
