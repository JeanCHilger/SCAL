The assessment of bladder and urethral function in spinal cord injury patients. The correlation between the anatomic site of spinal cord injury and real-time conditions of bladder and urethral function was assessed in order to provide a reasonable basis for the clinical treatment of neurogenic bladder. A total of 134 patients with spinal cord injuries (105 males, 29 females averaged 34.1 years old) were involved in this retrospective analysis, including urodynamic evaluation, clinical examination and imaging for anatomical position, and Bors-Comarr classification. The associations between the levels of injury and urodynamic findings were analyzed. The results showed that mean follow-up duration was 16.7 months (range 8-27 months). Complete spinal cord injuries occurred in 21 cases, and incomplete spinal cord injuries in 113 cases. Of the 43 patients with upper motor neuron (UMN) injuries, hyperreflexia and (or) detrusor sphincter dyssynergia were demonstrated in 30 (69.8%), 31 (72.1%) suffered low bladder compliance (less than 12.5 mL/cmH(2)O), 28 (65.1%) had high detrusor leak point pressures (greater than 40 cmH(2)O), and 34 (79.1%) had residual urine. Of the 91 patients with lower motor neuron (LMN) injuries, areflexia occurred in 78 (85.7%), high compliance in 75 (82.4%), low leak point pressures in 80 (87.9%), and residual urine in 87 (95.6%), respectively. The associations between the anatomical site of spinal cord injury and urodynamic findings were ill defined. In patients with spinal cord injury, this study revealed a significant association between the level of injury and the type of voiding dysfunction. The anatomical site of spinal cord injury can not be predicted in real-time condition of bladder and urethral function. Management of neurogenic bladder in patients with spinal cord injury must be based on urodynamic findings rather than inferences from the neurologic evaluation.
