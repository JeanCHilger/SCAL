The beneficial effects of early stabilization of thoracic spine fractures depend on trauma severity. The timing of stabilization for thoracic spine injuries is discussed controversial. Although early repair of long bone fractures is known to reduce complications, few studies investigate this issue in spine trauma.We retrospectively investigated 160 patients (January 2000 to March 2003) with spine fractures from Th1 to L1, which were stabilized. Patients were divided into two groups: early stabilization within 72 hours or later. Other subgroups were analyzed for the relationship of neurologic status, injury severity, and incidence of preoperative lung failure.: Severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score >or=38 pts) with early stabilization had a significantly shorter intensive care unit-stay (14 days [1-34 days] vs. 20 days [1-39 days] p < 0.05) and overall shorter hospital stay (56 days [9-147 days] vs. 108 days [11-198 days]Our data provide further evidence that early stabilization of spine injuries is safe. In severely injured patients, it does not impair perioperative lung function and results in a reduced overall intensive care unit and hospital stay.
