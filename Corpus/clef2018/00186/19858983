Completely displaced S-1/S-2 growth plate fracture in an adolescent: case report and review of literature. In children, pelvic fractures are not common, and therefore, sacral fractures are a rare occurrence. Sacral fractures are often associated with neurologic deficit. Using radiographs alone may not be adequate to diagnose sacral fractures, and computed tomography scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed. Treatment of the sacral fracture is often controversial and can range from nonoperative management to surgical intervention. This article presents a case report of completely displaced S-1/S-2 growth plate fracture. It also describes our diagnostic and treatment approach based on similar previously reported cases.
