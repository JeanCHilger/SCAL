Traumatic Type III odontoid fracture and severe rotatory atlantoaxial subluxation in a 3-year-old child: case report. In this report, the authors describe the case of a 3-year-old child with a traumatic Type III odontoid fracture. To their knowledge, this is the first reported case of a true Type III odontoid fracture with atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation in a child. The patient presented with pain and had resisted manipulation of the neck following a motor vehicle crash. Plain cervical radiographs revealed an odontoid fracture, which was confirmed by CT imaging. The left lateral mass of C-1 was rotated anterior to that of C-2 with the displaced odontoid process acting as the pivot point of rotation. The C1-2 alignment was normalized, and the C-2 fracture was reduced completely. The regional anatomy and mechanism of injury, radiographic diagnosis, and management of cervical spine injuries in children are discussed.
