Intervertebral disc calcification with neurological symptoms in children: report of conservative treatment in two cases. Intervertebral calcifications are rare in the paediatric population. Two cases of children with symptomatic intervertebral calcifications responsible for spinal cord compression and neurological compromise are presented.The data of two children treated conservatively for a symptomatic intervertebral calcification responsible for spinal cord compression and neurological compromise were retrospectively reviewed.Frontal and lateral radiographs are usually sufficient to determine the presence and extent of the calcified cervical disc protrusion. Conservative treatment with antalgics and bracing was applied in both cases. The two patients were completely free of symptoms 4 weeks after initial treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging screening showed a complete vertebral canal clearance at final follow-up.Despite the lack of significance due to the small number of patients, conservative treatment should be considered in children with moderate neurological symptoms due to calcified disc protrusion.
