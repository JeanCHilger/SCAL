Medical training therapy with special consideration to osteoporosis of the spinal column. Medical training therapy (MTT) plays a decisive role in maintenance and development of musculoskeletal health of humans in all phases of life. In childhood and adolescence it can contribute to the highest possible so-called peak bone mass and thus avoid or delay the appearance of osteoporosis for as long as possible, in view of increased life expectations. In young adults targeted MTT is well suited to improve performance and to maintain the maximum developed bone mass. The latter is also true for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women in whom MTT can compensate for the loss of bone mass due to hormone deficiency in comparison to those not in training. Elderly people who have possibly already suffered several fractures and who are in danger of becoming permanently dependent on external help due to increasing fragility can still improve muscle strength and mass by regular MTT even in advanced age. This will reduce or avoid the risk of falling and maintain the ability to be self-sufficient for as long as possible. In order to support this, rehabilitation measures even in-hospital, could be useful and should be especially promoted in line with the amendments to the social legislation effective from 1st April 2007 ("Rehabilitation before nursing").
