Operative management of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Operative management of unstable burst vertebral fractures is challenging and debatable. This study of such cases was conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi from January 1998 to April 2003. All surgically managed spine injuries were reviewed from case notes and operative records. Clinical outcome was assessed by Hanover spine score and correction of kyphosis was measured for radiological assessment. The results were analyzed by Wilcoxon sign rank test for two related samples and p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Ten patients were identified by inclusion criteria. There was statistically significant difference between mean pre-and postoperative Hanover spine score (p=0.008). Likewise, there was significant difference between mean immediate postoperative and final follow-up kyphosis. (p=0.006). Critical assessment of neurologic and structural extent of injury, proper pre-operative planning and surgical expertise can optimize the outcome of patients.
