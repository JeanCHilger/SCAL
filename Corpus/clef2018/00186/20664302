Foreign body granuloma mimicking upper cervical spinal mass after dural repair with Tachocomb [correction of Tachocomp]: a case report. The common indications of dura mater repair are injuries caused by trauma, neoplasms, surgical complications and congenital spinal dysraphism such as meningomyelocele or encephalocele. Dural grafting is done to recreate the dural barrier and avoid the possible postoperative complications. Autografts derived from periosteum, fascia, muscle and fat. The disadvantages of autografts are their small size and esthetic complaints. To overcome the disadvantages synthetic materials might be used in duroplasty. Here we present a 3-year-old girl who developed muscle weakness in the upper and lower extremities caused by foreign body granuloma mimicking malignancy in the cervical spinal cord after dural repair done via Tachocomb.
