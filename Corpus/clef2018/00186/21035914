Penetrating neck trauma: a case for conservative approach. Selective conservative management of penetrating neck trauma is a commonly adopted procedure to manage patients of such trauma. However, at places where trauma services are inadequate on different counts and a low-intensity military conflict is on, relevance of this approach without compromising the safety and well-being of the patient remains to be evaluated.The study aimed to address the relevance of selective conservative management of penetrating neck trauma in a low-intensity military conflict of Kashmir.This was a prospective case study of patients presenting to the ENT Head & Neck Surgery department with penetrating neck trauma for a 2-year period from June 2003 to May 2005. After a careful physical examination in the emergency room, immediate surgical intervention or a careful observation is planned. Relevant investigations in the latter group if indicated by clinical examination determined whether to operate or to continue such approach. The data were collected and analyzed.Forty-six patients fulfilled the criteria to be included in the study. Eight patients (17.4%) underwent immediate surgical intervention, whereas the remaining patients (78.26%) were carefully observed for a minimum of 24 hours. Two patients of the active observation group required delayed exploration because of the close proximity of projectile to vessels. None of the patients in either group died. There was significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of hospital stay, use of diagnostic tests, and complications.Selective conservative management is a cost-effective approach for penetrating neck trauma even in areas where there is relative paucity of advanced trauma services. These results further reinforce the validity of careful physical examination as a reliable tool to guide further management without necessarily resorting to expensive and at times difficult to do diagnostic tests.
