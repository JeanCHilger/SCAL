Standardization of data analysis and reporting of results from the International Spinal Cord Injury Core Data Set. The objective of this study was to provide guidelines for reporting results using the International Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) Core Data Set.International.A committee was created on request of the chair of the Executive Committee for the International SCI Data Set committees. The committee developed a draft consisting of set of recommendations, which were then reviewed and approved by the entire Executive Committee.Age at injury is recommended as reported by the mean, s.d., median and range. When grouped, 15-year increments are recommended as follows: 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75 and 76+ years. For pediatric SCI, 0-5, 6-12, 13-15, 16-21 years are recommended. Time since injury should be reported by mean, s.d., median and range. The following intervals are recommended: <1 year, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 years, and 5-year increments thereafter. Calendar time (years during which the study is conducted) is recommended grouped by either 5 or 10-year increments with years ending in 4 or 9. For 'length of stay', the mean and s.d., as well as the median is recommended for report. Severity of injury is under ordinary circumstances recommended, reported in five categories: C1-4 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade (AIS) A, B or C C5-8 AIS A, B or CIt is expected that these recommendations can facilitate a more uniform reporting of the very basic core data on SCI. This will facilitate comparison between different SCI studies.
