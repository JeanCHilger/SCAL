Combined anterior-posterior arthrodesis en patient with athetoid cerebral palsy who developed spondylotic cervical mielopathy. Case report and review of literature. Spondylotic cervical mielopathy is a common complication in young patients with Cerebral Child Palsy with an important dystonic and athetoid component. Its surgical treatment is a challenge, due to elevate incidence of early faliure of the arthrodesis, both in anterior and posterior approaches. We report an historical review about the treatment of cervical mielopathy in this subgroup of patients and a clinical case in which we decided to realize decompression and arthtrodesis by a combined anterior and posterior approach, with lateral-mass screw placement, using botulinium toxin injections in the postoperative period, achieving a good clinical outcome.
