Self-rated health among persons with spinal cord injury: what is the role of physical ability? Self-rated health (SRH) is a powerful concept that has greatly advanced our understanding of health and health outcomes. The SRH measure has become increasingly common in health research. Yet, puzzles remain about what shapes SRH ratings. The absence of knowledge is particularly acute in the context of disability. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between SRH and self-rated physical ability in a sample of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).Data from 140 eligible participants drawn from a study of life in the community after SCI were analyzed. The study, cross-sectional in design, was conducted in a large urban city in the mid-western United States. Basic statistics such as ANOVA and chi-square tests were performed as appropriate, and a multiple linear regression analysis modeled the relationship between SRH and physical ability adjusting for potential confounding variables.Self-rated physical ability was significantly associated with SRH after controlling for relevant covariates (P < 0.001). An analysis of the interaction between physical ability and level of injury revealed that the relationship was significant for persons with paraplegia but not for persons with tetraplegia.This study provides evidence that self-rated physical ability is an important factor associated with SRH for persons with SCI, but that the strength of the relationship depends on level of injury (paraplegia vs. tetraplegia). The challenge for future research is to replicate the study using a more comprehensive measure of physical ability and to ask how beliefs in one's ability to do those activities that are most meaningful and desired shape SRH. Only in this way will our understanding of the physical ability-SRH relationship be clarified.
