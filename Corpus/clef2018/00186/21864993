Prognostic value of prevertebral space involvement in nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on intensity-modulated radiotherapy. To investigate the prognostic significance of prevertebral space involvement (PSI) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).A retrospective review of data from 506 biopsy-proven, nonmetastatic NPCs was performed. Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging examinations and received IMRT as their primary treatment.In this series, 161 NPC patients (31.8%) had PSI. Parapharyngeal space (p < 0.001), skull base (p < 0.001), and paranasal sinuses (p = 0.009) were associated with PSI after multivariate analysis. The 4-year overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) for NPC patients with and without PSI was 69.1% and 89.2% (p < 0.0001), 83.9% and 96.4% (p < 0.0001), and 71.6% and 89.6% (p < 0.0001), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified PSI as an independent negative prognostic factor for both OS (HR = 1.478-4.380 p = 0.001) and DMFS (HR = 1.389-4.174For NPC patients treated with IMRT, PSI was found to be an independent prognostic factor for both OS and DMFS. It seems reasonable that PSI should be classified as a T4 disease on the basis of the current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification criteria.
