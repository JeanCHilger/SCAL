Soothing suffering swimmers: a systematic review of the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal injuries in competitive swimmers. This review details the examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of injuries encountered by competitive swimmers. Primarily, these involve the shoulder, however, the spine, knee and hip can be involved. Using the Coleman methodology score, we show that the methods used in obtaining and reporting clinical findings and intervention results could be improved. Where possible, we suggest improvements.A literature review was conducted in English, Italian, French and German using PubMed, Google Scholar and Ovid search engines with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria.Poor technique, and high training intensity and distance are the most common cause of missed swim practice and competition through injury.Few articles agree on a single method of each of clinical examination, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation.Articles are consistently retrospective with few investigating spine, hip and knee injuries.Clinical findings and rehabilitation methods should be reported using a more structured method possibly based on the Coleman methodological scoring system.
