Two different courses of impaired cervical kinaesthesia following a whiplash injury. A one-year prospective study. A longitudinal study was conducted to observe persons with neck pain after motor vehicle collisions. The aims were to reveal the prospective development of cervical kinaesthesia and to investigate the association between the test results and self-reported pain and disabilities. Two different cervical kinaesthetic tests, the Fly test and the Head-Neck Relocation test, measured movement control and the relocation accuracy of the cervical spine, respectively. Self-assessment measures included pain intensity (VAS), neck pain and disability (NDI), fear of re-injury (TAMPA) and psychological distress (GHQ-28). Seventy-four subjects entered the study, but 47 were eligible, as they participated in all 4 measurements at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-collision. According to the performances on the two kinaesthetic tests, the subjects could be classified into improvement and non-improvement groups, respectively. The result revealed, for the first time, two different courses of deficient cervical kinaesthesia. About half of the participants showed significant deteriorating performances in both kinaesthetic tests throughout the year (p < 0.002), while the other half improved their performances (p < 0.02). Generally, the relationships between the kinaesthetic tests and the self-assessment scores were not significant, irrespective of the performances on the two kinaesthetic tests. Accordingly, the results of the questionnaires correlated poorly or weakly with the kinaesthetic test results at all assessment points. The need for developing a new questionnaire, capturing the symptoms prevalent in patients with neck pain and cervical sensorimotor impairments is urgent. What determines the two different kinaesthetic courses need to be scrutinised in future research.
