Giant osteochondroma of axis in a child with multiple hereditary exostoses:  case report and review of literature. Though osteochondromas are the most common benign bone tumour, their spinal involvement is less frequent. We report a case of osteochondroma in a 5-year-old female child with multiple hereditary exostoses that originated from posterior elements of C2 vertebra, not involving spinal canal and caused restriction of neck movement. It was excised from its base without disturbing the continuity of lamina. Two years later she had normal neck movements without any recurrence. The rarity of this tumour at this location, with such a large size at an early age, makes this article unique.
