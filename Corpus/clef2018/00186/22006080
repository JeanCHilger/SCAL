Validation of the Brazilian version in Portuguese of the Thoracic-Lumbar Control Scale for spinal cord injury. Prospective clinical study.This study aimed to translate, adapting to Brazilian version in Portuguese, validate and measure inter and intra-examinator reliability and internal consistency of the Thoracic-Lumbar Control Scale instrument.State University of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.This instrument was translated to Brazilian Portuguese by a bilingual translator, and it was retranslated to English for conflict correction and cultural adaptation. Two physiotherapists were previously trained to standardize the scale administration. In all, 22 patients were selected and initially assessed through FIM and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) instruments. Furthermore, they were evaluated through the Thoracic-Lumbar Control Scale by two examiners and revaluated 1 week after by only one examinator.The Brazilian Portuguese version of Thoracic-Lumbar Control Scale showed excellent intra and inter-examinator reliability (0.961 and 0.986), high value of internal consistence (0.934) and significant correlation with ASIA sensory score (r=0.83, P=0.001).The Brazilian Portuguese version of Thoracic-Lumbar Control Scale is a valid and efficient instrument to assess trunk control of after-spinal cord injury patients, which certifies its replicability by other neurology professionals.
