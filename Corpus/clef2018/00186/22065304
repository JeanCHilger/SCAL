Differing perceptions of intervention thresholds for fracture risk: a survey of patients and doctors. This survey suggests that patients are prepared to accept higher absolute fracture risk than doctors, before considering pharmacological therapy to be justified. Patients require that drug treatments confer substantial fracture risk reductions in order to consider long-term therapy.Absolute fracture risk estimates are now incorporated into osteoporosis treatment guidelines. At present, little is known about how patients regard fracture risk and its management. We set out to describe and compare the views of patients and doctors on the level of fracture risk at which drug treatment is justified.A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 114 patients referred for bone density measurement and 161 doctors whose practice includes management of osteoporosis. Participants were asked about fracture risk thresholds for pharmacological intervention.The absolute risk of both major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture at which drug treatment was considered by patients to be justifiable was higher than that reported by doctors [major osteoporotic fracture, median (interquartile range): patients, 50% (25 to 60) doctors, 10% (10 to 20)Patients are prepared to accept higher absolute fracture risk than doctors, before considering pharmacological therapy to be justified. Patients require that drug treatments confer substantial fracture risk reductions in order to consider long-term therapy.
