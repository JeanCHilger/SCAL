Treatment of upper cervical spine instability with posterior fusion plus atlantoaxial pedicle screw. To evaluate the clinical efficacies, indications and application values of posterior fusion plus pedicle screw fixation in the treatment of upper cervical spine instability.From May 2006 to December 2010, a total of 24 patients with atlantoaxial instability were treated with C1-2 pedicle screws and rod fixation under general anesthesia. There were 18 males and 6 females with a mean age of 49.8 years old (range: 17 - 69).The postoperative radiographs verified a good position of all screws with satisfactory atlantoaxial reduction. A mean follow-up period of 23 months (range: 3 - 45) showed no injury of spinal cord and vertebral artery or inter fixation failure. Atlantoaxial alignment and stability were restored without instrumentation-related complications.Posterior atlantoaxial pedicle screw and rod fixation provide immediate three-dimensional rigid fixation of atlantoaxial joint. It is a more effective technique than with previously reported techniques.
