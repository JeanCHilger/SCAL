Endoscopic endonasal resection of the odontoid peg for paediatric basilar invagination. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder whose primary manifestations are fractures, bone deformity and bone pain. Brainstem compression due to basilar invagination is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of OI. Children with this condition often require significant medical input and multiple admissions to hospital. Traditionally, anterior decompression is carried out through an open trans-oral route. We describe an endoscopic endonasal approach for resection of the peg in a child with OI and basilar invagination. We believe this approach provides an excellent alternative with minimal morbidity and decreased length of stay especially in the paediatric population.
