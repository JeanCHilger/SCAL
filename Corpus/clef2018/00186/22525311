Epidemiology of traumatic cervical spinal cord injury in Tianjin, China. A retrospective epidemiological study.To describe the recent epidemiological characteristics of traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (TCSCI) in adults in Tianjin.Tianjin Medical University General Hospital.This study included all TCSCI patients aged ≥ 15 years who were admitted to a general hospital from December 2008 to November 2011. Epidemiological characteristics including gender, age, marital status, occupation, etiology, level of injury, severity and America Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale were recorded.A total of 143 patients with TCSCI were included in the study. Mean age was 54.6 ± 14.6 years (men 53.5 ± 14.9 years, women 54.2 ± 12.1 years), with a range of 18-87 years, and the male/female ratio was 5:1. The leading cause was falls (49.7%), followed by motor vehicle accidents (36.4%). The most common injury site was C5, accounting for 42%. In all, 74 (51.7%) patients had complications the most common complication was hyponatremia (30.1%), followed by urinary infection (23.1%), respiratory infection (18.2%), bedsore (9.8%) and deep venous thrombosis (4.9%). As for the severity, ASIA grade D was encountered most frequently. Six patients died, five of whom died from respiratory failure.The epidemiology of TCSCI has its own characteristics. Falls were the leading causes, and TCSCI occurred most frequently in the middle-aged and elders. Therefore, establishing public policies aimed at preventing injuries should focus on falls and more attention should be paid to the aged regarding their vulnerability to low fall. Additionally, complications should be prevented in TCSCI patients.
