Solitary osteochondroma of the atlas causing spinal cord compression: a case report and literature review. Solitary osteochondroma (SOC) of the spine is very rare, though OC is the commonest benign tumour of the bone. Only about 1-4% of SOCs occur in the spine. And solitary ostechondroma of spine causing cord compression is even rarer. These tumours slowly enlarge, creating insidious but progressive symptoms of myelopathy or radiculopathy or both. Clinical histories, routine radiographs, CT studies, MRI studies and histopathological studies are the adjuncts for a definitive diagnosis. Surgical intervention can lead to functional and neurologic improvement with very little chance of recurrence. The authors present a case of a C1 posterior arch intraspinal SOC with cord compression who recovered very well after surgery and was doing well without recurrence after 1 year of surgery. The authors are reporting this case with English language medical literature review as it is quite rare among the SOCs of the cervical spine.
