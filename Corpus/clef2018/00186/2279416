Fractures of the posterior apophyseal ring of the lumbar vertebral body in young patients. Three cases. Three cases of posterior apophyseal fracture of a lumbosacral vertebral body are described. This disco-apophyseal lesion is typical of adolescents and sports-related trauma. Like all acute and chronic apophysiolyses it is probably enhanced by a constitutional weakness of the apophyseal area, closely fused with the anulus fibrosus of the disc.
