Occipital condyle fracture: clinical case and a review of the literature. We present a case report of an occipital condyle fracture, a rarely seen injury in patients of any age, and particularly so in paediatric patients. The objective of this article is to inform about this lesion, such often going unnoticed, but should be especially looked for in cranial trauma cases with neck pain. An X-ray may be normal and diagnosis is best made by using computed tomography imaging. Treatment should depend on whether the fracture is stable or not.We report on two patients, 17 and 40 -year-old males who presented with an impacted right occipital condyle fracture following a motorbike accident. Cervical immobilization was carried out with a hard collar.Good results were obtained and there were no secondary effects of a neurological or functional nature.In conclusion, the knowledge of this condition, its correct diagnosis and the correct treatment choice is crucial to the avoidance of brachial plexus injuries and other important sequelae.
