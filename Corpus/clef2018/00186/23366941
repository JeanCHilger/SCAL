Investigation of the Treadport for gait rehabilitation of spinal cord injury. The goal of this study is to compare the effect of training by the University of Utah's Treadport versus a conventional treadmill on gait improvement of spinal-cord-injury (SCI) patients. Four incomplete SCI subjects who had reached a rehabilitation plateau were selected to have training first on the treadmill and then the Treadport. Spatiotemporal and gait parameters were utilized to make a comparison between the two training conditions. Overall, the results demonstrated statically significant improvements in most of the spatiotemporal as well as some of the gait parameters during training with the Treadport relative to the traditional treadmill.
