Utility of clinical examination and CT scan in assessment of penetrating neck trauma. Managing penetrating injuries adequately and effectively depends a great deal on proper assessment of the injury. This study carried out was done at The Aga Khan University Hospital to assess the role of clinical examination and CT scan imaging in evaluation of penetrating neck injuries. A total of 68 students were included, with ages ranging from 3 to 74 years. The involved zones and the injured structures were noted. Results showed a high sensitivity of clinical examination in assessing vascular (81%) and airway trauma (77%), with a low sensitivity for esophageal trauma (34%). For CT scan the sensitivity was 90% for vascular trauma, 83% for airway trauma and 53% for esophageal injuries. Clinical findings and CT scan imaging are important assessment tools for evaluation of penetrating neck traumas, with a high sensitivity for vascular and airway injuries.
