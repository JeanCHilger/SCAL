Application of reduction by posterior approach to treat severe spondylolisthesis. To investigate the technique of reduction by posterior approach for severe spondylolisthesis, and to discuss the method to prevent nerve stretch injury.Between July 2007 and April 2011, 17 patients with severe spondylolisthesis underwent reduction, fixation, and fusion by posterior approach. There were 2 males and 15 females with a median age of 15 years (range, 8-67 years) and a median disease duration of 18 months (range, 5 months-16 years and 4 months). The level of spondylolisthesis was at L4 in 1 case and Ls in 16 cases the spondylolisthesis was at degree III in 12 cases and degree IV in 5 cases according to Meyerding classification. There were 16 cases of developmental spondylolisthesis (high-dysplastic and low-dysplasia spondylolisthesis in 9 and 7 cases, respectively) and 1 case of traumatic spondylolisthesisIt can obtain satisfactory clinical result to use spinal canal decompression by posterior approach, the Schanz screw fixation of the slipped vertebrae, the intervertebral and posterolateral fusion for severe spondylolisthesis. The risk of nerve stretch injury can be prevented by choosing the lowest height of intervertebral cage, modulating the reductive degree of slipped vertebrae according to the strain of exiting spinal root, and correcting lumbosacral kyphosis.
