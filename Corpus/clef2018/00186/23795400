Natural head position and growth of the facial part of the skull. The aim of this study was to determine any correlation between natural head position and cranio-cervical growth direction and if natural head position influences facial growth direction. One hundred sixty (160) cephalometric radiographs were examined and cranio-cervical inclinations determined (angles: NS-Ver, NS-OPT, NS-CVT). On the basis of the NS-ML angle, radiographs were divided into two groups: mandibular anteriorotation and posteriorotation. On the basis of the SGo/NMe index, two groups were formed: short-faced and long-faced subjects. The angles NS-Ver, NS-OPT, and NS-CVT describe cranio-cervical inclination. Subjects with anterior mandible growth do position their heads more vertically and have a shorter face, and those with posterior mandible growth tilt their heads more backwards and have a longer face. An adaptive head position can be a factor in altering the direction of facial growth. Determination of head position and mandible growth direction can be an important indicator in patients with TMD treatment.
