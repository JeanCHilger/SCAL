Cervico-occipital meningioma in a 5-year-old child: a case report. Childhood meningiomas are scarce in clinical practice with an incidence ranging from 0.4 to 4.6% of all pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Cervico-occipital meningiomas account for 3.7% of childhood meningiomas and are slightly more frequent in male.A 5-year-old female presented with febrile posterior cervico-occipital pain for 3 weeks. She was diagnosed with meningitis and treated for a similar period with adapted antibiotics. The pain persisted even after treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhancing subdural extra medullary mass of the cervico occipital junction, developing around the left vertebral artery. The characteristics of the lesion were strongly suggestive of a neuroma. Surgical removal of the tumor aiming the decompression of the spinal cord and nerve roots was performed with a surprising discovery: The tumor was tightly attached to the dura at the entry of the left vertebral artery. The resection was total and only a thin part close to the artery was left. The pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of meningothelial meningioma.Meningioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of contrast enhancing subdural extra medullary lesions of the cervico-occipital junction in children.
