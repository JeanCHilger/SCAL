Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy of a severely injured patient after secondary survey. Thoracic injury following a major trauma can be life threatening. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) can be used as a support to mechanical ventilation when acute respiratory distress syndrome is present. We report the case of an 18-year-old male driver who strayed from the road and fell 15 m into a backyard by landing on the roof of its car. The injury severity score was 51 for his pattern of injuries (hemopneumothorax left, sternum fracture, pneumothorax right, pneumomediastinum, intracerebral bleeding, scalping injury occipital, fracture of the ninth thoracic vertebral body, and complete paraplegia). The patient was transferred to our hospital 12 hours after the accident. As we started the secondary survey, the patient was cannulated for vv-ECMO due to deterioration in his oxygenation status. We implanted a double-lumen cannula (Avalon31F catheter, right internal jugular vein) during fluoroscopy. The patient developed posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which began to resolve after 72 hours, and he started breathing spontaneously. After 7 days, he was weaned from vv-ECMO and recovered in a rehabilitation facility. The use of vv-ECMO therapy in cases of major trauma has become a rescue strategy. The use of vv-ECMO was performed without anticoagulation because of his traumatic brain injury and severe spinal cord injury.
