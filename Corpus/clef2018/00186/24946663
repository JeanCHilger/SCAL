Cephalometric evaluation of the airway space and head posture in children with normal and atypical deglutition: correlations study. Head posture has been related to pharyngeal space, especially in the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults. However no studies were found that evaluated the possible correlation between head posture and pharyngeal airway space measured in children with atypical swallowing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible correction between head posture and the measurement of pharyngeal space on radiographs of children who were in the period of mixed dentition who demonstrated atypical swallowing and in children with normal deglutition. A retrospective clinical study, using cephalometric analysis of lateral radiographs to obtain measures of the antero-posterior dimension of the pharyngeal airway space (PAS) and the angle formed between the base of the skull and the odontoid process (CC1) between two groups: the 55 radiographs experimental group (with atypical swallowing) and 55 radiographs of the control group (normal swallowing). The Spearman Coefficient of Correlation was used to evaluate the possible relationship between PAS and CC1 was used. Results indicated a positive correlation between measures of CC1 and PAS (r = 0357) only in the control group (normal swallowing).There is positive correlation between head posture and measure pharyngeal airway space (PAS) in the group of normal swallowing. This correlation was not observed in the experimental group (atypical swallowing).
