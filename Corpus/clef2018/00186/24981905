A review of pediatric lumbar spine trauma. Pediatric spine fractures constitute 1%-3% of all pediatric fractures. Anywhere from 20% to 60% of these fractures occur in the thoracic or lumbar spine, with the lumbar region being more affected in older children. Younger children tend to have a higher proportion of cervical injuries. The pediatric spine differs in many ways from the adult spine, which can lead to increased ligamentous injuries without bone fractures. The authors discuss and review pediatric lumbar trauma, specifically focusing on epidemiology, radiographic findings, types and mechanisms of lumbar spine injury, treatment, and outcomes.
