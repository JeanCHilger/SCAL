Urethral diverticulum. Complication in males with spinal cord lesions. We report on 4 spinal cord injury patients with urethral diverticulum from urethral lesions caused by urine collecting systems. We advocate one-stage surgical repair with the following precautions: treatment of the septic condition prior to surgery, puncture cystostomy, and closure of the surgical wound using methylene blue.
