The diagnostic and treatment characteristics of spinal fractures in the victims of multiple trauma. The authors present their experience in the treatment of 107 patients with spinal injuries associated with polytrauma. The topical diagnosis of the spinal lesions in the severely injured patients was rather difficult both at the preclinical stage and during the clinical examination. For making the diagnosis in combined spinal trauma urgent laparoscopy and aimed roentgenography was employed with the patient in the dorsal position. When the latter technique is employed, a special attachment ("cassette holder") is used which allows to make the roentgenograms with mobile X-ray units. The authors have proposed a new construction of the reclining hammock for the treatment of the patients with the thoracic and lumbar spine traumas associated with severe injuries of the head, the breast and the extremities. It is pointed out that in the patients with complicated spinal injuries the surgical treatment of the locomotor system is most effective.
