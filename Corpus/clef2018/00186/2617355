Traumatic cervical spine injuries in childhood and adolescence. Of 84 consecutive children and adolescents with traumatic cervical spine injuries treated over a 10-year period, 61 (73%) were available for review. Age ranged from the newborn period to 17 years. Analysis of injury type revealed four groups of roughly equal incidence: atlantoaxial rotary subluxation, upper cervical fracture or dislocation, lower cervical injury, and spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality. Forty-four percent of patients incurred a neurologic injury. Falling from a height was the most common mechanism of injury. Apart from patients with complete neurologic deficits, the prognosis for these injuries is good.
