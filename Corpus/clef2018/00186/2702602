CT and myelogram findings of os odontoideum. We reviewed the findings of CT and myelogram of cases of os odontoideum. The diagnosis was confirmed by conventional tomogram in all these cases. Four cases were further confirmed by trans-oral decompression. Cartilage was found between the os odontoideum and the odontoid process during operation in these 4 cases. Four of them had no history of trauma and 2 of them had an associated anomaly one was Down's syndrome, and the other was barrel chest and congenital dislocation of hips. CT findings of os odontoideum in these cases were a constriction and/or a gap of bony structure between the os odontoideum and the odontoid process. Myelograms showed spinal stenosis as a result of atlanto-axial dislocation, or anterior extradural compression from overgrown cartilage and posteriorly dislocated tip of shortened odontoid process.
