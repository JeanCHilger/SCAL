Thoracic spine injuries in victims of motorcycle accidents. Spinal cord injury can be devastating. Cervical spine roentgenography has been recommended in all severe multisystem trauma patients but little attention has been given to the thoracic spine. In a series of 266 motorcycle accident victims, seen over a 42-month period, 13 cases of thoracic spine injury were identified. During this same time interval four cases of cervical spine injury were identified. Eleven of the 13 cases involved a catapulting ejection from the motorcycle and resultant axial loading to the thoracic spine. Thoracic spine injuries are more common in these patients and therefore the thoracic spine should be immobilized until full thoracic spine roentgenography can be carried out.
