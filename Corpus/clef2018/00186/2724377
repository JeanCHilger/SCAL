Penetrating neck injuries: recommendations for selective management. There were 225 patients with penetrating neck wounds admitted over a 4-year period. Mechanism of injury included stab wounds in 59%, gunshot wounds in 32%, and shotgun wounds in 9%. Location of injury was Zone 1, 16%, Zone 2, 42%, Zone 3, 18%, posterior triangle, 12%, and multiple, 12%. The patients were divided into five groups based upon clinical presentation, location of injury and method of management: Group 1 (n = 31) had serious blood loss or respiratory distress and were immediately explored Group 2 (n = 76) had anterior wounds and equivocal physical findings either without (n = 60) or with negative (n = 16) contrast studies and these had "mandatory explorations"
