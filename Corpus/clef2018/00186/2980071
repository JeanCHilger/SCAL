Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thoracolumbar fractures. Many patients suffer neurologic deficits as a consequence of thoracolumbar fractures. A major surgical effort often entails decompression of the neural elements. Which patients would benefit from this endeavor remains to be determined. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as one of the foremost neurodiagnostic procedures. This study assessed the impact of MRI on the management of these injuries in 21 patients. Five anatomical parameters were evaluated. Significant associations were noted between the neurologic morbidity from the injury and (a) the relative level of the conus medullaris and (b) the patency of the ventral subarachnoid space. On the basis of these data, a treatment protocol is presented. MRI has gained prominence as an investigative tool in cases of thoracolumbar trauma.
