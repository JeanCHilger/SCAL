The odontoid process in children--is it hypoplastic? An analysis of the cervical spine of 508 normal children aged between 3 and 18.9 years provided data for the normal development of the odontoid process and its relationship to the anterior arch of the atlas. In normal children under the age of 9 years, the tip of the odontoid may fall well short of the upper margin of the anterior arch of the atlas. This has important implications for the assessment of atlanto-axial instability in children with Down's syndrome.
