Difficulties of differential roentgeno-diagnosis of aneurysmal cysts and tumors of flat bones and the spine. Clinico-roentgenologic data on 33 cases of aneurysmal cyst of the bone (flat bones--12, spinal cord--21) were assessed. Such peculiarities of the aneurysmal cyst of flat bones as large size, cellular--trabecular structure and a peripheral periosteal "shell" were identified. Vertebral cysts involved processes, arches and body resulting in compression fracture. They sometimes extended to adjacent vertebrae and ribs. Vertebral cysts should be differentiated mainly from giant-cell tumors, metastases and myeloma.
