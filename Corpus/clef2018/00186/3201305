Vertebral hemangioma associated with spinal cord compression. We have described a case in which a vertebral hemangioma caused spinal cord compression in a 14-year-old girl. The diagnosis was originally missed for several reasons, one of which was the failure to obtain a plain film of the spine before ordering both CT and MR studies. This case illustrates the importance of basic diagnostic procedures.
