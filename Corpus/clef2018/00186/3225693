Magnetic resonance imaging of acute spinal cord trauma: preliminary report. Forty-three magnetic resonance studies were performed on 28 patients with suspected spinal cord injury using a 1.5 Tesla magnet and surface coils. Imaging was performed between day 1 and day 16 post injury. In several patients, repeat magnetic resonance studies were performed to evaluate the resolution of the cord lesions. Three types of magnetic resonance signal patterns were seen in association with the cord injuries. Patients with intraspinal hemorrhage did not have significant neurological recovery, whereas patients with cord edema/contusion recovered significant neurological function. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be useful in the diagnosis of acute cord injury and also appears to demonstrate the potential for predicting neurological recovery.
