Managing the difficult airway in patients with burns of the head and neck. A five-phase defined protocol for airway security was developed and administered to a consecutive, selected series of surgical patients with burns to the head and neck that limited their mouth opening or neck mobility. The protocol uses fiberoptic light and scope systems to allow the anesthesia team to visually place the endotracheal tube properly before anesthesia is induced. The technique provides safe, efficient airway management for patients with burns to the head and neck and significantly diminishes patient risks.
