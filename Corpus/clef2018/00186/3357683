Idiopathic scoliosis posterior spine fusion with Harrington rod and sublaminar wiring. The Harrington-sublaminar wiring technique has been used to treat idiopathic scoliosis for over 6 years. In all cases, satisfactory correction was obtained. The advantages of this technique include biomechanically stable fixation, elimination of a postoperative support or simple immobilization in removable underarm orthoses, and the ability to correct a two-plane deformity (i.e., lordoscoliosis). The potential disadvantages include increased operating time over Harrington rod alone, possible neural injury, and failure of instrumentation.
