Section II: General orthopaedics. Anterior cervical fusion for trauma. Anterior bone grafts of 24 injured cervical spines were reviewed with respect to early postoperative instability and eventual malunion. Spinal redislocation or graft extrusion occurred in 21% representing failure to attain early stability. In 38%, the late complication of kyphotic malunion occurred, averaging 21%. The Yale instability criteria were fulfilled in 15 cases and mechanical complications developed in 87% of these. When posterior instability was present, the mechanical complication rate rose to 92%. Early stabilization of most neck injuries is not achieved by the anterior bone graft and its use as a means of "stabilization" is unsubstantiated by clinical experience.
