Pott's paraplegia of late onset. The cause of compression and results after anterior decompression. Twenty-two patients with late onset Pott's paraplegia presenting at a mean of 18 years after initial symptoms were reviewed an average of seven years after treatment by anterior decompression and fusion. Fourteen patients had active disease, and in 12 of these, activity at the internal kyphus was the direct cause of the paraplegia. In the other two, a soft healing bony ridge was the cause. The eight patients with healed disease had hard bony ridges compressing the cord. The response to anterior decompression was faster, better and safer in patients with active disease: nine recovered completely and three significantly. In patients with healed disease, the anterior decompression was technically more difficult and the recovery less satisfactory. Significant complications included two cases with neurological deterioration, two with cerebrospinal fluid fistulae and four with neurapraxia of the cord.
