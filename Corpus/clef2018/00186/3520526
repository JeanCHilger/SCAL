Lumbar puncture. Technique, indications, and complications. Lumbar puncture is a safe and simple procedure that can be performed with little risk of major complication if proper technique and indications are followed. As an emergency diagnostic procedure, spinal puncture is indicated when CNS infection is suspected or to establish the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage when results of cranial computed tomography are normal. The major contraindication is elevated intracranial pressure with evidence of a mass lesion.
