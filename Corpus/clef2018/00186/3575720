Hangman's fracture: radiologic assessment in 27 cases. Traumatic spondylolisthesis of C-2, frequently referred to as the hangman's fracture, is typically regarded as a hyperextension injury with rare neurologic sequelae by virtue of decompression of the neural canal. The authors retrospectively evaluated their radiographic experience with this injury in 27 patients over a 24-month period. Lateral cervical spine studies and computed tomography (CT) scans (21 patients) were analyzed. CT studies provided better delineation of the fracture in all 21 patients and significant additional information in five patients (24%). Seven patients (26%) suffered initial neurologic sequelae in association with the C-2 injury. Nine patients had additional sites of fracture, including seven with associated C-1 ring disruption (26%). Extension of the fracture line into the transverse vertebral artery foramen led to vertebral artery injury and cerebellar embolization in one patient. Angiography may be necessary to detect intimal injury to the vertebral arteries when the fracture extends through the transverse foramina and to indicate the need for anticoagulation when clinically feasible.
