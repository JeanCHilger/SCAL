Retropharyngeal mediastinal pneumatocele. Report of a case. We report the case of an infant with penetrating neck trauma followed by an upper respiratory tract obstruction. This case presented a diagnostic and management dilemma because of the development of an unusual retropharyngeal collection of air. In our review of the medical literature, we were unable to find any other case with a similar manifestation and clinical course.
