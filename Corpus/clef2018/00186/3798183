Penetrating neck injuries: experience with selective exploration. Although many authors have stated that surgical exploration should be mandatory for all neck wounds that penetrate the platysma, recent reports from many centers now claim that selective exploration is both safe and reasonable. A policy of selective exploration based on clinical presentation, anatomic location, and results of diagnostic studies has been followed at The Cooper Green Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, for the past 13 years. We report a study of penetrating neck wounds in 136 consecutive patients admitted to The Cooper Green Hospital from 1972 to 1984. Seventy-seven patients (57%) had exploration immediately, with one death, while the remaining 59 (43%) were admitted and observed. Of these 59 patients, ten had arch aortography and nine had esophagography, all of which yielded normal results. The remainder of the patients observed had no clinical signs or symptoms to suggest a major injury. There were no deaths or complications related to the neck wounds in the 59 patients observed. Results of 27 explorations (35%) were negative. We conclude that selective exploration of penetrating neck wounds is both safe and reasonable.
