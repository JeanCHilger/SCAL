Applications of computed tomographic scanning of the cervical spine. Computed tomography is an extremely valuable adjunct to the evaluation of the cervical spine and spinal cord. When combined with intrathecal metrizamide enhancement and with computer reformatted images in sagittal and coronal planes, CT is a thorough diagnostic modality that can be applied to congenital/developmental, degenerative, and trauma-induced abnormalities. Its major deficiency is the potential to miss defects that are oriented in the transverse plane because of partial volume averaging of adjacent surrounding bone. CT scanning of the cervical spine has been used sparingly to date, probably because available scanners are used for higher-priority demands. However, anecdotal information in the literature document the value of CT in evaluations of the cervical spine, intervertebral disks, neural foramina, and spinal cord. In the future, magnetic resonance scanners may shift some of the imaging burden away from x-ray CT. More widespread use of CT for evaluation of cervical radiculopathies and myelopathy may then occur.
