Neck motion in the high school football player. Observations and suggestions for diminishing stresses on the neck. In a group of 40 high school athletes (height: 166.37 to 189.57 cm, average, 174.40 cm neck circumference: 35.56 to 41.91 cm, average, 39.12 cm), the neck motions were studied in flexion and extension, clinically, radiographically, and cineoradiographically. Flexion ranged from 34 to 84 degrees (average 72 degrees) and extension from 21 to 64 degrees (average 45 degrees) without helmet and shoulder pads. In well-fitting equipment flexion ranged from 36 to 86 degrees (average 73 degrees) and extension from 12 to 56 degrees(average 34 degrees). No correlation was determined between the size of the athlete's neck and the range of motion. The size of the athlete's neck was important in the determination of maximum stresses in the neck. The helmets impinged on the shoulder pads or interscapular region
