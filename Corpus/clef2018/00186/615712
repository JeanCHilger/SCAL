The use of hyperbaric oxygenation in the treatment of spinal cord lesions. In 13 patients with compressive spinal cord lesions we performed a trial of treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HO). This therapy was postoperatively administered when neurological deficit persisted. In order to assess the effect of each individual HO session (given daily at an inspiratory oxygen pressure (PO2) of 1.5 atmospheres absolute for 40 min) as well as of the entire HO therapy (consisting of 10-15 single sessions in each case) neurological and electromyographical follow-up examinations were regularly performed. In 6 of the 13 patients we found a marked improvement, particularly in motor functions. The other patients only showed little change in neurological status. Arterial and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PO2 were concurrently measured in 8 patients during HO sessions. The values of both showed a considerable increase. The rise in CSF PO2 may be regarded as indicative for an improved oxygenation of the spinal cord tissue during HO treatment. On the basis of these findings we may assume that repetitive HO treatment can be helpful in the management of compressive spinal cord lesions.
