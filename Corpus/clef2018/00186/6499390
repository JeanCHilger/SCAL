The value of urethrocystography in the investigation of patients with spinal cord injury. In a review of 127 urethrocystograms carried out on 92 males with spinal cord injury the following conclusions were drawn. (1) In the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux or urethral reflux into the male adnexa, bladder outlet obstruction should be suspected. (2) Lesions of the anterior urethra develop easily as the result of indwelling catheterisation in patients lacking sensation. A retrograde urethrogram is necessary to demonstrate these lesions. (3) Severe trabeculation of the bladder wall can be a sign of high-pressure outlet obstruction. (4) Dilatation of the bladder neck in patients with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia may lead to total urinary incontinence after sphincterotomy. (5) Urethrocystography is not a valid investigation to detect bladder stones.
