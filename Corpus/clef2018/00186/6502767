Gunshot injuries in children. Ninety consecutive patients between 2 and 15 years of age sustaining gunshot wounds were analyzed and a management algorithm evolved. Key management steps included fluid resuscitation in the field by trained paramedical personnel and recognition of the severity of the wound when large-caliber or shotgun injuries were encountered. Arteriograms were most helpful in locating vascular injuries venograms were inaccurate. Morbidity was directly related to missile size and impact area, and to the number of organs injured. Any hospitalization beyond 2 weeks' duration should have social service, home-bound school service, psychiatry, and physical therapy in consultation. During a 5-year period only two of the 90 patients died secondary to hemorrhagic shock.
