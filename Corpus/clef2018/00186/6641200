Computerized tomography in diagnosis of pelvic abscess in spinal-cord-injured patients. Twenty-four spinal-cord-injured patients with pressure sores, and suspected of having other complications were studied by CT, gallium scanning, and ultrasonography. CT was found to be by far the modality of choice for evaluation of the extent and depth of the pressure sore, assessment of the thickness of fibrous tissue scar alongside its boundaries and at its base, detection of associated peri-pelvic and intra-pelvic soft tissue abscesses, sinus tracts and osteomyelitis of the pelvic bones.
