Harrington instrumentation for thoracic and lumbar vertebral fractures. Thirty-seven patients with fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine treated with Harrington instrumentation were reviewed. Twenty-seven patients with a follow-up time of more than 2 years were summoned for a clinical and radiographic examination. This report presents the results related to reduction, stabilization, return of neural function, spinal posture and mobility, and residual disability. It is concluded that Harrington instrumentation can be performed without a substantial number of complications. Its major advantages are early mobilization and ambulation. The operative technique is discussed with special reference to the preservation of the normal configuration of the back. The value of computerized tomography in the preoperative assessment is stressed.
