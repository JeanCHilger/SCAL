Treatment of nontraumatic atlantoaxial dislocation and fibrous fusion. Case report. The authors describe a case of nontraumatic atlantoaxial dislocation secondary to acute rheumatic fever, in which there appeared to be fibrous fusion between the axis and the atlas in the subluxed position. The dislocation was reduced by means of combined traction and steroid therapy. Fibrous fusion occurred in the realigned position after immobilization.
