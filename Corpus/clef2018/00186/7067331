Cervical spine changes in goitres. The cervical spine was studied in neck radiographs of 160 unselected patients and in 100 controls. Anterior marginal osteophytes were observed in 37.5% of the goitre patients and in 17% of the controls. Straightening or reversal of cervical lordosis occurred in 29.4% of patients with goitre and only 8% of controls, with none of the control group showing reversal of cervical curvature. The changes are thought to be due to stresses imposed on the cervical spine as a result of a continuous reflex attempt to bend the neck forwards and reduce pressure on the trachea from the enlarged thyroid gland.
