Diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The author suggests own diagnostic criteria of multiple sclerosis based on history data, neurological examination, conventional laboratory investigations and electrophysiological methods. Three sets of data (conditions) make possible the diagnosis of the following multiple sclerosis forms: a) multifocal plurisegmental, b) multifocal monosegmental, c) monofocal. The differential diagnosis of these types is discussed in brief.
