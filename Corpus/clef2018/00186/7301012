Traumatic rupture of the medulla with subarachnoid-pleural fistula (author's transl). A case of total dural and spinal cord disruption at level T2 in a 23 month-old female is presented. The authors emphasized the absence of spinal shock in this young child. Spine X-ray examination failed to reveal any abnormality. X-ray films of the chest demonstrated fluid in the right pleural space and mediastinum associated with a subarachnoid-pleural fistula. The possible mechanisms responsible for the spinal cord disruption and the absence of spinal shock are discussed.
