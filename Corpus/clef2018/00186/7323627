CT imaging of traumatic lesions of the vertebral column (author's transl). The article reports on 30 patients with traumatogenic lesions of the vertebral column examined by computerised tomography. The pros and cons of CT of the spine are discussed. Since, in the authors' opinion, the advantages of CT of the spinal column are greater than the drawbacks, it is claimed that CT is justified especially in polytraumatised patients and in unstable fractures of the vertebrae. As a rule, CT of the vertebral column can replace conventional x-ray tomography and myelography in polytraumatised patients.
