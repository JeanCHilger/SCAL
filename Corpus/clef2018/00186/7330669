Efficacy of CT scanning in a group of 174 patients with orthopedic and musculoskeletal problems. One hundred and seventy-four patients with orthopedic and musculoskeletal problems received computed tomography (CT) scans between January 1979 and July 1980. There were 34 trauma patients, 35 patients with known or suspected primary tumors, 20 patients with metastases, 18 patients with suspected spinal stenosis, 25 patients with disc problems, five patients with infections, 13 children with congenital anomalies, and 24 patients with miscellaneous problems. The CT scans proved useful in all the pediatric cases, 97% of the trauma patients, and in the majority of patients with tumors. It appears that absolute indications for CT scanning in orthopedic patients include acute trauma to the spine, pelvis, hip, and shoulder girdles as well as in children with congenital spinal anomalies. Relative indications include determining the extent of the tumor and also aiding in the correct approach for biopsying a lesion.
