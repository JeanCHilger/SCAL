Cerebral injury in child abuse: a changing profile. This report of 21 patients with cerebral injury resultant from child abuse, identifies a broad profile of central nervous sequelae from such injuries, 6 patients were admitted with whiplash shaken infants syndrome, all with severe signs of CS dysfunction. 3 children presented with acute cerebral confusions, 2 with severe cord injuries with resultant paresis and 10 with skull fractures or miscellaneous injuries. Computer tomography has proved to be of great assistance in precise identification of site and size of subdural/intracerebral hematomas in abused children and in identifying posterior fossa lesions and providing longitudinal assessment of sequelae of cerebral trauma. Also the role of the Child Protection Team in management of such acutely injured children is defined.
