High-grade transverse syndrome caused by echinococcus cysts. In this report we present the case of a 16-year-old patient, born in Macedonia, who complained of abdominal and back pain and developed paraparesis. On admission to hospital, he showed a paraplegic syndrome, the level of sensation being T7, together with high-grade paraparesis of the lower extremities and spasticity and urinary incontinence. The protein content of the CSF was raised to 183 mg/dl. CT and MRI of the thoracic spine showed cystic lesions at the level of the 6th and 7th thoracic vertebrae, in the paravertebral area and in the 7th rib on both sides. The antibody titer of Echinococcus in the serum was positive. To treat this problem, corporectomy of the 6th to 8th thoracic vertebrae was performed, the area being bridged by a corticospongoid pelvic bone graft and with instrumental support of the 5th to 9th thoracic vertebrae. Histological examination revealed multilocular Echinococcus lesions. Under long-term treatment with mebendazole, the neurological deficits decreased in the postoperative phase.
