Vertebral artery compression due to head rotation in thalamic stroke. Vertebral artery compression from head turning has been described in adults, especially in those who have spondylosis of the spine and osteophytes. There are no reports that demonstrate vertebral artery compression due to head turning in children without vertebral abnormalities. A child is reported with thalamic stroke in whom cerebral arteriography revealed vertebral artery compression on head turning. Blood flow in the vertebral artery, however, could be demonstrated by Doppler ultrasonography with the head in the midline. It is concluded that the vertebral artery is vulnerable to mechanical compression in the neck even in the absence of bony abnormalities.
