Surgical management of spinal epidural hematoma: relationship between surgical timing and neurological outcome. Thirty patients were treated surgically for spinal epidural hematoma (SEH). Twelve of these cases resulted from spinal surgery, seven from epidural catheters, four from vascular lesions, three from anticoagulation medications, two from trauma, and two from spontaneous causes. Pain was the predominant initial symptom, and all patients developed neurological deficits. Eight patients had complete motor and sensory loss (Frankel Grade A) six had complete motor loss but some sensation preserved (Frankel Grade B)
