Penetrating trauma of the neck. Two hundred forty-six patients admitted to the Trauma Unit of Cook County Hospital with penetrating neck wounds have been reviewed. A policy of mandatory neck exploration combined with a systematic approach to resuscitation and a diagnostic evaluation including neck and chest X-rays, endoscopy, and arteriography has been employed. The study has revealed a high incidence of negative neck explorations (63%) but minimal morbidity (less than 1%), no mortality, and a brief duration of hospitalization in the negative exploration group. Patients with positive explorations had an 8% morbidity and a 9% mortality rate. In addition, 13 of the patients with positive explorations had clinically negative wounds which might have been overlooked if selective management had been utilized in this series. We conclude that a policy of mandatory neck exploration is justified and advisable for patients sustaining penetrating neck injuries.
