An anterior intradural neurenteric cyst of the cervical spine: complete excision through central corpectomy approach--case report. The case of a cervical intraspinal neurenteric cyst in a 6-year-old boy is reported. The anterior intradural location of the cyst was confirmed by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging.
