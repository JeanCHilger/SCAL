Reconstruction of the hypoplastic posterior arch of the atlas with calvarial bone grafts for posterior atlantoaxial fusion: technical report. Posterior atlantoaxial fusion is a common procedure performed for instability at C1-C2. This operation requires intact posterior elements of both the atlas and the axis. When this is not the case, the incorporation of the occiput and the lower spinal segments is usually required for adequate posterior fusion, but such a procedure limits the mobility of the upper cervical spine. A technique for the reconstruction of the posterior arch of the atlas with calvarial bone is described in this report. This technique allowed the successful fusion of the C1 and C2 vertebrae in a patient with traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation who also had a congenital absence of the posterior arch of the atlas.
