Congenital malformations causing skull base changes. Recent advances in imaging have enabled both the clinician and radiologist to better understand the therapeutic implications of congenital anomalies involving the skull base. Critical to this understanding is a full knowledge of normal embryologic development, anatomic detail, and clinical manifestations in the wide variety of congenital malformations involving the skull base. This review focuses on individual malformations in terms of their pathophysiology and their imaging findings of critical importance.
