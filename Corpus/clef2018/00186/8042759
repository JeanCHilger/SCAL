What's new in cardiopulmonary resuscitation? American Heart Association. A strong consensus was reached for several changes in the guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiac care (ECC) in the 1992 conference on CPR and ECC held by the Emergency Cardiac Care Committee of the American Heart Association. These new recommendations, together with differing recommendations of the European Resuscitation Council, are described. An unresponsive person with spontaneous respirations should be placed in the recovery position if no cervical trauma is suspected. Compared with endotracheal intubation, other airway-protecting devices such as combination esophageal-tracheal tubes are of minor acceptance. During ventilation, the time for filling the lungs is increased to 1.5-2 s to decrease the likelihood of gastric insufflation. Delivery of i.v. drugs can be enhanced by an i.v. flush of sodium chloride. In endotracheal drug administration, higher doses and drug dilution are recommended. In infants and children up to 6 years of age, the value of intraosseous drug administration is emphasized. For pulseless adult victims, the initial dosage of epinephrine of 1 mg i.v. remains unchanged. For repeat doses, high-dose epinephrine up to 0.1 mg/kg is classified as of uncertain but possible efficacy. For lidocaine, the recommended i.v. dosage is 1.5 mg/kg. Sodium bicarbonate and calcium are not routinely recommended for resuscitation. For atropine, the maximum dose is 0.04 mg/kg. If hypomagnesaemia is present in recurrent and refractory ventricular fibrillation, it should be corrected by administration of 1 to 2 g magnesium sulfate i.v. Thrombolytic agents are classified as useful and effective in acute myocardial infarction and should be administered as early as possible. Glucose-containing fluids are discouraged for resuscitative efforts.
