Broadband ultrasound attenuation of the os calcis: preliminary study. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) measurements of the calcaneus were performed in 87 healthy subjects and in 17 patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. In 52 normal subjects, bone mineral densities (BMD) of the lumbar spine were measured by quantitative CT (QCT), and in another group of 15 normal subjects, BMD of the lumbar spine was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BUA showed a negative significant correlation with age (r = 0.44 p < 0.001), and was more pronounced in women. A significant positive correlation of BUA in the os calcis with lumbar BMD using QCT (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) or DXA (r = 0.81
