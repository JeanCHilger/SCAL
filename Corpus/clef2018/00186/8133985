Hemodynamic parameters in patients with acute cervical cord trauma: description, intervention, and prediction of outcome. The cardiovascular response of the patient with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is known to be altered secondary to the cord injury. Our current protocol of managing the acute phase of patients with SCI includes invasive hemodynamic monitoring (with arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter) and support with fluids and dopamine and/or dobutamine, titrated to maintain a hemodynamic profile with adequate cardiac output (to be determined by oxygen consumption and delivery) and a mean blood pressure of > 90 mm Hg. We feel that this protocol provides two benefits: 1) maintaining the mean blood pressure improves the morbidity of these patients by deterring ischemia and accompanying secondary insults 2) aggressive monitoring and hemodynamic intervention help stabilize the hemodynamic status of these patients and make it possible to consider early surgery in selected cases. Our hypothesis is that the pulmonary vascular bed is more sensitive to the sympathectomized effect of acute complete cervical SCI. We analyzed the demographic, neurologic, and hemodynamic data of 50 consecutive patients during their first week postinjury. All had signs of myelopathy
