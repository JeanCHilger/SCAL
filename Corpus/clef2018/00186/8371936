The Functional Independence Measure: a comparative study of clinician and self ratings. In recent years the Functional Independence Measure has emerged as a standard assessment instrument for use in rehabilitation and therapy programmes for disabled persons, including those with spinal cord injury (SCI). This measure was devised to be rated by a clinician familiar with the patient. We studied 40 spinal cord injury patients who were rated on the FIM by a clinician within the 6 weeks prior to discharge, and who then rated themselves on the FIM at one month post discharge. There was a strong correlation between the differently rated scores. This suggests that the FIM can be given to patients as a self-report questionnaire, thus reducing time of assessment and increasing assessment potential.
