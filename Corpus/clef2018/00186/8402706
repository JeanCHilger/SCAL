Childhood intervertebral disc calcification. Two cases of intervertebral disc calcification in children are reported. A 13-year-old boy presented with right subscapular pain radiating into the axilla with radiographic demonstration of multiple calcified intervertebral discs and a herniated fragment of calcified nucleus pulposus at T2-3. His condition improved with conservative therapy, and follow-up radiographic evaluation revealed resolution of the herniated calcified disc material. A second case of multiple intervertebral disc calcifications was observed incidentally in an asymptomatic 6-year-old boy. The clinical presentation of this condition, its incidence, natural history, proposed etiologies, treatment options, and outcome are reviewed.
