Review of 19 cases of dislocation and fracture-dislocation of the cervical spine treated with anterior screw plates without intersomatic graft. In comparison to posterior fixation by Roy-Camille plates which does not require bone grafting, 19 cases of anterior plate fixation, also without bone grafting, are presented (11 dislocations, 2 severe sprains, 4 fracture-dislocations and 2 "tear-drop" fractures of the lower cervical spine). A satisfactory osteoligamentary consolidation was obtained in every patient. The advantages of this technique are discussed.
