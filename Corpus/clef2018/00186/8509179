Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of spinal injuries. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination was carried out on 44 patients who had spinal injuries with neurological involvement. The technique provided valuable information about the nature of the injuries and, in particular, about the state of the spinal cord. The appearances of the cord on MRI ranged from normal, to oedema, to more severe damage such as cord haemorrhage or transection or, in later cases, myelomalacia. The appearance of the cord on MRI correlated strongly with both the severity of the neurological deficit and also the degree of subsequent recovery. In the assessment of the acute spinal injury, MRI has been shown to be a good prognostic indicator it may also help to identify which patients are likely to benefit from early decompression.
