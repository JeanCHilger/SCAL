Management strategies for tumors of the axis vertebra. Primary and metastatic tumors of the axis vertebra pose difficult surgical problems. The authors report 14 cases of patients with axis tumors who underwent surgery between 1970 and 1993. The eight male and six female patients ranged in age from 9 to 70 years (mean 46 years). Presenting symptoms and signs included pain in 12, myelopathy in nine, radiculopathy in four, and cranial nerve deficits in two patients. Preoperative instability of the cervical spine was present in eight patients. The goal of surgery was to achieve diagnosis, decompression, and stabilization the choice of operative intervention was based on tumor location and patient prognosis. Six transoral-transpalatal resections, two lateral extrapharyngeal approaches, four posterolateral decompressions, and 11 dorsal decompressions were performed. Eleven fusion procedures were required to achieve spinal stability. Patients with aggressive tumors requiring concomitant radiotherapy underwent fusion using contoured loop instrumentation or methyl methacrylate, whereas those with benign lesions underwent fusion using traditional techniques. With maximum medical and surgical intervention, 10 patients are alive and their tumors are in remission. In eight of these 10 patients, gross-total resection was achieved. Four patients died from tumor progression, and in three of these cases gross-total resection was not possible. There were no operative deaths and morbidity was minimal. Development of new surgical approaches to the axis has allowed resection of previously inoperable tumors. The extent of resection correlated with the duration of survival. A classification system for axis tumors is proposed to facilitate selection of appropriate surgical approaches that will maximize the extent of resection while achieving or maintaining spinal stability.
