Pott's Paraplegia--67 cases. Sixty-seven patients were treated for Pott's paraplegia: 58 were adults and 9 were children. Sixty-four patients had active disease, and 3 had healed disease. All patients had triple chemotherapy with or without decompression surgery. Thirteen patients, including 9 children, were treated conservatively, whereas 54 patients who met the selection criteria for surgery were treated surgically. Fifty-two patients had anterior radical decompression surgery, and for 14 of them, anterior surgery was preceded by posterior instrumental stabilization surgery. Two patients with healed disease had posterior decompressive corpectomy. There was functional recovery in 60 (89.6%) patients, including 13 who had active disease that was treated conservatively. In 47 of the 54 surgically treated patients there was neurologic recovery, and 2 of these recovered incompletely with some residual spasticity. In the remaining 7 patients, there was no recovery. It took 2 to 6 months for recovery for the patients with conservative treatment, whereas it took <2 months for the patients with anterior decompression. The patients who had the combined 2-stage procedure could be mobilized earlier after neurologic recovery than could the patients having the anterior radical surgery and the conservatively treated patients. It was proven that paraplegia of active disease can be treated successfully by conservative or surgical means and that paraplegia caused by healing of fibrosis in the severely deformed spine was difficult to treat successfully, even with radical surgery.
