Traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation: a case report with survival. We reported a case of a patient who survived anterior atlanto-occipital dislocation. A seven-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital due to disturbed consciousness after being involved in a traffic accident. With gradual improvement of consciousness, she showed bilateral abducens nerve palsy, quadriparesis and cervical instability. Lateral plain film showed anterior atlanto-occipital dislocation. MRI showed severe compression of the cervical cord and disruption of supporting ligaments of the cervicomedullary junction. After 4 months, cervical instability continued and posterior fixation was carried out with bone grafts. Her postoperative course was uneventful.
