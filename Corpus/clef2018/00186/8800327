Typical and atypical fractures of the odontoid process in young children. Report of two cases and a review of the literature. The most common injury to the odontoid process in children under the age of seven years is a fracture through the synchondrosis with or without anterior displacement of the odontoid process, but this is not the only type of fracture of the odontoid process in this age-group. Fractures above and below the synchondrosis and fractures with posterior displacement were described. Typical clinical features of these fractures are: (1) major and blunt trauma, (2) neck pain and resistance to active and passive head movements and (3) no or only slight neurological deficits. Conservative treatment had excellent results in the majority of cases. Nevertheless, there are a few specific indications for surgery.
