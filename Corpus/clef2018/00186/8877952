Treatment protocol for fractures of the odontoid process. Treatment results in 104 patients with odontoid fractures were reviewed. There were 2 type I, 62 type II, 32 type III fractures and eight epiphysiolyses in children <7 years old. Thirty-seven patients were managed nonoperatively using plaster casts, cervical braces, or halo devices. Sixty-seven patients were treated surgically including anterior screw fixation (ASF), posterior fusion (PF), and transoral anterior fusion (TAF). Plaster casts and cervical braces were effective for type I fractures and epiphysiolyses only. Halo devices provided successful results in stable type III fractures. ASF is the treatment of choice for most type II and unstable III fractures including some old cases. PF also provided successful union, although impaired cervical motion remained. It should be reserved for irreducible fractures, established nonunions, and as a salvage procedure. TAF should be limited to exceptional cases requiring anterior spinal cord decompression.
