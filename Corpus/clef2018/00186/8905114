Multifocal extra-abdominal desmoid tumor--diagnostic and therapeutic problems. The case of an 18-year-old girl is described who 1 year after surgical stabilisation of a spine injury developed a multifocal desmoid tumor in the scar region and another at a distance away from the scar in the area of the left scapula. After nononcological resection of both tumors subsequent diagnosis with magnetic resonance imagins (MRI) showed a questionable recurrence only in the scar positron emission tomography failed to elucidate the local situation. Because a radical re-resection would mean mutilation, and local radiation may damage the spinal cord, a 'wait-and-see' strategy was chosen for further follow-up.
