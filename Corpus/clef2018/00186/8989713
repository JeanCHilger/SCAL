Vertebral growth after thoracic or lumbar fracture of the spine in children. We studied vertebral growth after thoracic or lumbar fractures in 52 children followed up from the time of fracture until skeletal maturity. We identified pure anterior compression in 32, combined anterior and lateral compression in 11, and total vertical compression in nine. Six patients had no treatment, 42 had a conservative treatment, and four were operated on. In fractures with anterior compression < 10 degrees, no significant difference could be found between the group without treatment and the group with conservative treatment when the Risser sign was 0 or 1 at the time of injury. In such fractures with angles > 10 degrees, conservative treatment gave better results when the Risser sign at injury was < or = 2. Prolonged conservative treatment was not effective in children with a Risser sign of 3. The evolution of lateral compression seems to be related to the initial injury rather than to treatment. Vertical compression injuries were positively influenced by a conservative treatment when the Risser sign was < or = 2.
