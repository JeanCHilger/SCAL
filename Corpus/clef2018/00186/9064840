Penetrating head and neck gunshot injuries. A 10-year neurological material. 37 patients with penetrating injuries of the head or upper neck caused by gunshot wounds were admitted to the neurosurgical department during the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. There was a marked preponderance of males. 29 of the cases were attempted or successful suicides, four were homicides, and four were presumed to be accidents. The most common weapons used were pistol and rifle. Nine patients were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. There were eight survivors, seven of whom were operated on. Four of the patients suffered reduced vision, two of whom became blind. Two had hemiparesis, one had moderate mental dysfunction, and one recovered completely. None of the patients who were unconscious upon admission to hospital and had bilateral brain injury survived.
