Odontoid fractures in the child with neurological injury. Direct anterior osteosynthesis with a cortico-spongious screw and literature review. Few cases of fracture of the odontoid process in children have been reported in the literature. A case with an associated severe traumatic brain injury and a suspected clinical high cervical spinal cord injury is reported here. This case is of interest because of the surgical treatment selected. A direct surgical approach was used for anterior screwing, with an excellent result. In some precisely defined circumstances, therefore, this treatment can be indicated.
