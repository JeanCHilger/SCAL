One piece cervical device for cervical spine surgery. This study analyzed the use of the one piece cervical device (OPCD) surgically inserted to treat atlanto-axial or subaxial subluxation. Operative results, techniques, and the enhanced correction mechanism were studied.The results were correlated to provide a rationale for posterior cervical spinal fusion.Wiring techniques were generally performed for posterior fusion. Recently, the Luque rod has been used on the cervical spine.One hundred eighty-seven patients were analyzed clinically and radiologically. The operative techniques were detailed and the corrective mechanism explained through biomechanical considerations.The patients were followed from 2 to 13 years. The results were 94% satisfactory. No poor or worsening cases were encountered.Satisfactory operative results showed that the OPCD is safe, convenient, and reliable. It can be used in all areas of the cervical spine. The primary reason for these benefits is the enhanced correction mechanism of the OPCD.
