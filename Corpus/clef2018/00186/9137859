Simple bone cyst of the axis. A 12-year-old girl presented with a 1-month history of posterior neck pain and a large cyst in the second cervical vertebra. She underwent complete curettage of the cyst wall without any kind of bone graft, and the surgical result was good. Microscopic findings in the cyst wall were consistent with simple bone cyst, which is very rare in the spine.
