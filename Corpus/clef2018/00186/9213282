Comparison of neurologic deficits with atlanto-dens intervals in patients with Down syndrome. Eighty-four patients with Down syndrome had flexion-extension lateral roentgenograms of the C1-C2 articulation for the purpose of dividing the group into subluxators (> or = 4 mm atlanto-dens interval and 2 mm translation) and nonsubluxators (those who did not meet these criteria). Neurologic examinations and chart review were carried out on all patients to ascertain those with a positive neurologic finding or history. Seventeen (20%) were defined as subluxators and 67 (80%) as nonsubluxators. Five (29%) of the subluxators were found to have positive neurologic findings and 18 (27%) of the nonsubluxators had similar types of positive neurologic findings. These percentages are not significantly different. This led us to conclude that positive neurologic findings and an abnormal atlanto-dens interval are not alone adequate criteria to judge need for surgical stabilization of the C1-C2 articulation in patients with Down syndrome.
