Chondrosarcoma causing cervical neural foramen widening. Various neoplastic, vascular, and developmental causes may lead to spinal neural foraminal widening, the most common causes of spinal dumbbell lesions being schwannomas and neurofibromas. Occasionally, some other slow-growing tumors may cause neural foraminal widening. We report an exceptional case of a low-grade spinal chondrosarcoma which apparently developed from a pre-existing osteochondroma in the neural arcus of C6. The lesion passed through the C5-C6 foramen, producing a dumbbell mass.
