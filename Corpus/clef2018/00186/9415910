Complications of CT-guided biopsy of the spine and sacrum. This study reviews the results of 94 computed tomography (CT)-guided Craig needle biopsies of the spine and sacrum performed at one center. An indication for biopsy in this study was prompted by abnormal findings identified by one or more of the following diagnostic modalities: radiography, CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or bone scanning. These patients then underwent CT-guided Craig needle biopsy of the spine and sacrum for further evaluation. There were 1 biopsy of the cervical spine, 19 of the thoracic spine, 66 of the lumbar spine, and 8 of the sacrum. Biopsy sensitivity was 94.5% and specificity was 96.8%. This accuracy compared with other diagnostic modalities showed biopsy to be the gold standard for diagnosis of spine or sacral lesions. Of the 94 cases reviewed, 6 complications were noted. All complications were acute in nature and included 1 aortic puncture, 2 psoas punctures with associated psoas hematomas, 1 biopsy of an incorrect level, and 2 aborted procedures secondary to patient discomfort. No infections or neurological sequelae were seen. Although the benefits of CT-guided biopsy over open biopsy have been shown previously, this review demonstrates it is not without significant risk.
