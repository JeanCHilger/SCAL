Spinal fusion using a vascularized fibular bone graft for a patient with cervical kyphosis due to neurofibromatosis. We performed an anterior spinal fusion using a vascularized fibular bone graft combined with posterior fusion for a patient with severe cervical kyphosis due to neurofibromatosis. The kyphosis was corrected from 85 degrees preoperatively to 38 degrees postoperatively. A vascularized fibular bone graft is a useful surgical procedure in selected patients to obtain successful bony union.
