Vertebral sarcoidosis in adolescents. Two cases of vertebral sarcoidosis in pediatric patients are presented. All such patients reported have been black, 13-15 years old, and have a history of back pain. Radiographs of the involved vertebrae show primarily lytic destruction with sclerotic borders in some of the lesions. Fungal infections, tuberculosis, pyogenic osteomyelitis, Hodgkin's disease and metastatic disease must be considered in every patient with vertebral sarcoidosis.
