Cervical spine dysraphism with teratoma exhibiting pulmonary differentiation: case report and review of the literature. Spinal dysraphism and teratomas are well-recognized spinal cord lesions, but both entities are rare in the cervical spinal cord. Rarely, teratomas have been described within dysraphic lesions in the thoracic and lumbosacral regions. To date, teratomas contained within cervical spine dysraphic lesions have not been described. Although mature cystic teratomas are renowned for the array of organoid tissue differentiation they display, mature lung differentiation is a rarity. While pulmonary differentiation has been described in six female genital tract teratomas, it has not been reported in spinal teratomas. The clinicopathologic features of a complex cervical lesion, comprising a combination of cervical spine dysraphism with a mature cystic teratoma that exhibited pulmonary differentiation, is presented, and the literature on teratomas exhibiting pulmonary differentiation is reviewed.
