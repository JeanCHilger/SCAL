Dramatic development of quadriplegia in a young man while engaged in heavy manual labour: a post-traumatic spinal cord injury? A healthy 16-year-old male suddenly developed paraesthesiae in his hands during heavy manual labour. He was able to walk to the nearest doctor's practice himself. The symptoms worsened dramatically, and within a short period of time cardiac arrest occurred. After resuscitation and intensive care, quadriplegia due to a high cervical cord lesion was diagnosed. The patient died 70 days later without any changes in the neurological symptoms. Post mortem revealed severe focal ischaemic lesions in the cervical spinal cord in a mixed arterial/venous distribution, but no evidence of direct traumatic changes in the spinal cord, the spine or the soft tissues. All other possible causes than trauma were excluded. The clinical development of the symptoms suggest that this spinal cord lesion should be classified as a secondary traumatic spinal cord injury caused by a subluxation of the cervical spine. The pathogenesis of post-traumatic ischaemic damage to the spinal cord appears to be related to localized hypercoagulability resulting in the formation of microthrombi. Impaired microcirculation in a limited area and for a limited period of time may have caused the irregularly distributed ischaemic necrosis.
