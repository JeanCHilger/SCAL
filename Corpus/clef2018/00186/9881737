Evolving magnetic resonance spinal cord trauma in child: from hemorrhage to intradural arachnoid cyst. Acquired arachnoid cysts of the spinal cord are uncommon causes of spinal cord compression in the pediatric group. Meningitis, trauma and hemorrhage are considered to be causative or contributing factors. Interestingly, no spinal arachnoid cysts have been reported in patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis, conditions expected to cause arachnoid scarring. We describe a child of 1 year and 10 months with thoracic spine trauma with crural paraplegia and anesthesia at level T5 submitted to serial magnetic resonance imagery at 5 days and 18 months, after trauma showing evolution from subarachnoid hemorrhage and adhesions of the arachnoid space to a posterior hypertensive thoracic intradural arachnoid cyst.
