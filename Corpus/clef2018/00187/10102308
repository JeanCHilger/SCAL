Cervical spine injury in low-impact blunt trauma. Few data are available regarding the incidence of cervical spine injuries following relatively low-impact blunt trauma. This prospective level II trauma center study of low-impact blunt trauma found a 1.30% incidence of cervical spine injury. Impressive differences were found in such parameters as population characteristics, modes of injury, elapsed times to emergency department evaluation, and Revised Trauma Scores between this study group and those reported in prospective level I high-impact blunt trauma series. Cervical spine injury in low-impact blunt trauma is significant and often presents less than dramatically, thus emphasizing a need for maintaining a high index of suspicion at all times.
