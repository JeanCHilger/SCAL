Anterior cervical spinal epidural abscess in an infant. Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is rare in children, especially in newborns and infants, groups in which only very few cases have been reported. Because of the nonspecificity of presenting symptoms in children the diagnosis may be delayed, resulting in major permanent neurological deficits. In this paper, we report a case of cervical SEA in a 6-week-old infant who initially presented with fever and developed quadriparesis 19 days prior to admission. After emergency anterior decompression of the abscess the neurological function was improved immediately. Five months after surgery the neurological status was normal, an MR study showing disappearance of the epidural abscess and spinal cord indentation, and progressive fusion of the C3, C4 and C5 vertebral bodies. Anterior decompression without bone graft can provide an excellent prognosis in case of an anterior cervical SEA in infants.
