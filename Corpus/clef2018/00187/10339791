Neurological manifestations indicative of brucellosis. Eight patients presented neurological signs secondary to Brucella infection. The clinical presentation was a meningoencephalitis in three cases, a meningoencephalomyelitis in one case, an epiduritis with spinal cord compression in one case, an acute polyradiculoneuritis in two cases and a chronic polyradiculoneuritis in one case. Acoustic nerve was impaired in seven cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a lymphocytic meningitis and a high protein concentration in all cases. The agglutination test titers were elevated in the serum and in the CSF of seven patients (> or = 1/80) and two patients respectively. Brucella melitensis culture was disclosed in the blood of one patient and in the CSF of two patients. Three patients were treated by the association cycline and rifampicin whereas a tritherapy including cycline, rifampicin and TMP-SMZ was used in the other cases. Outcome was favorable in seven cases. This study outlines the polymorphism of neurological manifestations due to brucellosis, even in familial cases and this diagnostic must be especially done in Middle East and South Mediterranean countries.
