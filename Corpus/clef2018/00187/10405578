Results after surgical treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures. Seventy-eight patients with unstable, one-level fracture of the thoracolumbar spine and no neurological impairment were treated with short segment fixation, transpedicular autologous bone transplantation and posterolateral fusion. Kyphotic deformity and anterior column height improved significantly. Complications consisted of one case of late deep infection, three cases of seroma, four cases with 5 mm schantz screw breakage and two cases with screw loosening. Mild to moderate pain was present in 79% of the patients at follow-up, median 32 (13-72) months. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had returned to previous activity levels of employment. Short posterior internal fixation, transpedicular transplantation and posterolateral fusion allowed neurologically intact patients to be mobilized early, to spend median 12 days in hospital, and carried no risk of deterioration in neurological function.
