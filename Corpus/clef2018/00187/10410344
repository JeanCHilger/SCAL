Colour Doppler ultrasonography of retropharyngeal abscess. This study was conducted to determine the capability of colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) in evaluating retropharyngeal abscess in children.From July 1996 to February 1998, five children with clinical suspicion of retropharyngeal abscess were evaluated by CDU. The distance from internal carotid artery (ICA) to cervical vertebra (CV) (DICA-CV) at the upper cervical level was measured by longitudinal ultrasonography. Fifty healthy children, aged from 1 to 15 years, were recruited in the study to measure DICA-CV as control. Colour Doppler ultrasonography was used to differentiate abscess from other pathology and to detect carotid sheath invasion. Computed tomography was performed to confirm the sonographic diagnosis. Measurements of the DICA-CV at regular intervals were performed to monitor the progression of retropharyngeal abscess.Retropharyngeal abscess was highly suspected in all cases under sonographic studies. A patient was found to have carotid sheath invasion. Computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of retropharyngeal abscess in all cases. Retropharyngeal abscess can be evaluated by the measured DICA-CV. The DICA-CV decreased as the retropharyngeal abscess gradually resolved.Colour Doppler ultrasonography offers a sensitive method to evaluate retropharyngeal abscess in children. It can also be used to monitor the progression of retropharyngeal abscess and avoid unnecessary radiologic examinations.
