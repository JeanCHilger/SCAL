Fixed rotatory subluxation of the atlanto-axial joint in polytrauma patients. Traumatic atlanto-axial instabilities are rare entities in cervical spine injuries. There may be only subtle abnormal findings by plain radiographs, frequently resulting in a missed or delayed diagnosis. We report a polytraumatized patient with severe maxillofacial injuries, where preliminary radiological studies failed to verify rotatory instability of the atlanto-axial joint. A definite diagnosis was only established by further imaging studies, including CT scan reformations.
