Tracheobronchoscopy in injuries of the thorax and neck. The results of examination and treatment of patients with penetrating wounds of the thorax and the neck are analysed. Diagnostic potential abilities of roentgenography and tracheobronchoscopy are evaluated comparatively. High diagnostic and curative effectiveness of tracheobronchoscopy is detected, which is indicated in diagnosis of the wounds of the larynx and the trachea as well as in cases of technical difficulties during endotracheal intubation. Besides, tracheobronchoscopy is indicated in postoperative period for sanation of the tracheobronchial tree under visual control for prevention of broncho-pulmonary complications.
