Outcome of functional electrical stimulation in the rehabilitation of a child with C-5 tetraplegia. Hand function was provided for a six-year-old child with C-5 American Spinal Injuries Association (ASIA) classification-A tetraplegia through a percutaneous intramuscular (i.m.) functional electrical stimulation (FES) system. In conjunction with implantation of 10 percutaneous i.m. electrodes for provision of grasp and release of her right hand, reconstructive surgery was performed to provide upper extremity positioning to optimize hand use. The subject participated in FES training over a nine-week period for approximately five hours weekly, with an additional five hours each week dedicated to exercise and conditioning of her arm muscles. Physical and functional assessments included range of motion (ROM), manual muscle testing (MMT), activities of daily living (ADL) abilities and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), used to evaluate the effect of stimulated hand function and surgical reconstruction on functional ability. These were conducted prior to FES and surgery and repeated after rehabilitation training. With rehabilitation and training, the child was able to control her FES system. Physical assessments revealed increased strength of both shoulders and more useful range of arm movement. Functional assessments show that the FES system enabled her to perform age-appropriate ADL that previously were achievable only with physical assistance. Her overall level of independence in ADL ability increased, as did self-rated levels of satisfaction and performance on chosen activities. Positive gains demonstrated here suggest the need for further studies of FES systems in young children with SCI.
