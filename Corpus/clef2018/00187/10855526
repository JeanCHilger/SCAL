Malignant triton tumor in the thoracic spine. We present a 15-year-old patient diagnosed with peripheral neurofibromatosis (NF-1), who was admitted with paraparesis caused by a large intrathoracic tumor with an intracanalicular component that affected the spinal cord. After surgery his condition improved, but a year later he suffered a relapse and died. Histologically the tumor was diagnosed as malignant with neurogenic and myogenic differentiation ("malignant triton tumor"). Malignant triton tumors (MTT) are infrequent those found in the head and neck and the upper or lower extremities have a better prognosis than those in the retroperitoneum, buttock, or trunk. It is not clear whether this variation is due to a difference in tumor grade, stage, or resectability, or whether it is a consequence of therapy.
