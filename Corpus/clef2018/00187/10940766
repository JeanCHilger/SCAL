Trampoline injuries of the cervical spine. Trampolines were responsible for over 6,500 pediatric cervical spine injuries in 1998. This represents a five-fold increase in just 10 years. While most have been minor, paraplegia, quadriplegia and death are all reported. We present 2 cases of trampoline-related cervical spine injury and review the relevant literature. Additionally, we examine the efforts made to reduce the incidence of trampoline injuries, and discuss why these have failed. We conclude that safety guidelines and warnings are inadequate. In addition, we support recommendations for a ban on the use of trampolines by children.
