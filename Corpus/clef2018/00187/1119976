Whiplash injuries of the cervical spine. A catamnestic study. Whiplash injuries of the cervical spine are due to the rapid sequence of movements in opposite direction. They are mainly following rear-end collisions where the trunk is pushed rapidly forward. Very important forces act therefore on the different segments of the cervical spine and lead to lesions of the perispinal soft tissues, of the ligaments, of the disks and the bony structures. In 24 tables, the signs and symptoms in 104 personal cases observed for a period which lasted more than 4 years are described. Amongst the clinical signs there are cervical strain, cervico brachial pain, headaches, radicular signs as well as symptoms of concussion and cercial medullar lesion. Radiological findings are discrete functional X-rays sometimes show local diminution of motility in a single segment. The treatments, amongst these immobilisation and local heat, are discussed. The unusually long duration of local disturbance is stressed. Signs of neurasthenia are part of the typical findings and do not at all mean a secondary neurotic development.
