Correlation of cervical vertebra maturation with hand-wrist maturation in children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of cervical vertebra maturation as an indicator of skeletal age during the circumpubertal period. This was determined by correlating cervical vertebra maturation to hand-wrist maturation. The vertebral skeletal age was assessed using lateral cephalometric radiographs according to maturity indicators modified from Lamparski. The hand-wrist skeletal age was evaluated in radiographs with the system developed by Fishman. The sample consisted of 503 subjects (244 boys and 259 girls), aged 8 through 18 years. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients and Wilcoxon sign rank test showed that a statistically significant relationship existed between the two assessments. Both the intra- and inter-judge tests of reliability displayed no significant differences. The results of this study indicate that skeletal age assessment made from the maturational changes of cervical vertebrae were reliable, reproducible and valid.
