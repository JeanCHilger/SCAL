Incidence rates and populations at risk for spinal cord injury: A regional study. A 6 year retrospective study was conducted.The populations at risk for spinal cord injury (SCI) in the northwestern Kentucky (KY) and southern Indiana (IN) regions were identified following examination of the causes and factors associated with SCI.The database included patients primarily from the surrounding KY and IN counties admitted to the University of Louisville (U of L) Hospital.Specification of SCI patient demographics, injury causes and related factors was achieved utilizing the hospital's trauma institute database and an extensive review of patient medical records.An adjusted average incidence rate of 27.1 cases per million per year was obtained for this region. A high rate of SCI was found for the youngest age group, 14-24 year olds, and for African Americans. A high frequency of injuries was also observed for adults between the ages of 25-39 years. Motor vehicle accidents (MVA) were the leading cause of SCI. Contributing factors included alcohol and widespread non-use of vehicle safety precautions.In addition to the high proportion of youth at risk for SCI, a higher proportion of older adults with SCI was observed for this region compared to other studies. Because the primary source of transportation in this area is the use of private vehicles, rather than public transportation, greater effort is warranted in emphasizing the potential risks of combining driving with alcohol consumption and non-use of seatbelts.
