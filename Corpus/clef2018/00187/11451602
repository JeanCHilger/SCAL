Serial tissue expansion for reconstruction of burns of the head and neck. There is little reported on serial tissue expansion for reconstruction of burns of the head and neck. Fourteen children (mean age 7.8 years, range 3-11 years) treated over almost an 11 year period, had a total of 67 expanders used. Fourteen children had expansion performed on the first occasion, 14 again on a second occasion, 10 on a third occasion and one on a fourth occasion. The major complication rate (expander extruded prior to completion of the expansion process) was 21,25 and 14%, respectively. In all cases, the burn scar was completely excised or reduced in size. Serial tissue expansion should be considered as a useful method of reconstruction burns of the head and neck.
