Use of a craniofacial miniplate for internal fixation in a young child with cervical instability. Case report. Commercially available anterior cervical internal fixation devices are designed for placement in adults and older children. Use of these systems in preschool-aged children is precluded due to the small size of their cervical vertebral bodies (VBs). The authors describe a 2-year-old boy who suffered a C3-4 injury, resulting in complete ligamentous disruption. Because of the gross cervical instability, they elected to perform surgery via posterior and anterior approaches, supplemented with internal fixation, during the same operation. The purpose of the anterior internal fixation device is to deliver compressive forces onto the interbody graft and keep it in place, thus optimizing the potential for a successful fusion. Because of the discrepancy in size between the VBs and the plate and screws, however, the authors were unable to use any of the standard anterior cervical fixation devices. Instead, they implanted a craniofacial miniplate, and the patient was required to wear an external halo brace. The miniplate provided enough stability to allow for a solid fusion. The authors believe that this technique is a reasonable option in young children who require anterior cervical fixation.
