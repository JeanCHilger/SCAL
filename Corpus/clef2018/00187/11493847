The Torg--Pavlov ratio in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a comparative study between patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and a nonspondylotic, nonmyelopathic population. A radiologic study to compare the Torg--Pavlov ratios between patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and a nonspondylotic, nonmyelopathic population.To determine and compare the Torg--Pavlov ratios between the two groups of patients.Patients with congenital cervical spinal canal stenosis are more likely to develop cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The Torg--Pavlov ratio eliminates errors related to magnification, a problem with determination of spinal canal stenosis from direct measurements of plain cervical spine radiographs. There has only been one other study that directly compares the Torg--Pavlov ratio between patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and a normal control population.The preoperative plain lateral cervical spine radiographs of 28 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy requiring surgical decompression were compared with radiographs of 88 nonspondylotic, nonmyelopathic patients. The Torg--Pavlov ratio was computed for each level from C3 to C7.The study showed that the Torg--Pavlov ratio is significantly smaller (P < 0.001) in myelopathic patients (mean 0.72 +/- 0.08) compared with the control patients (mean 0.95 +/- 0.14). This was so when individual levels and the mean values were compared. Age was also found to be a significant factor (P = 0.002), although lesser in magnitude when compared with the Torg--Pavlov ratio (P = 0.0001).The Torg--Pavlov ratio is significantly lower in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy compared with a nonspondylotic, nonmyelopathic population. It could possibly be used to predict the likelihood of developing cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
