Effectiveness of the complex therapy using physical factors of patients with spinal cord injuries. It is demonstrated that a trauma of the spine with a damage of the spinal cord in the thoracal area leads to an increase in the tone of the sympathical and parasympathical part of the vegetative nervous system and arterial tone of the affected extremities. In a multiple treatment by physical factors in most of the patients the author found a correlation between the clinical picture and a subsequent increase in the tone of the sympathical part of the vegetative nervous system and arterial tone of the legs.
