Gunshots to the neck: selective angiography as part of conservative management. Trauma units all over the world are faced with an ever-increasing number of gunshot injuries. While the traditional view is that exploration is mandatory for all gunshot wounds to the neck, this issue is now often debated amongst trauma surgeons. The aim of this particular study was to assess the outcome of gunshot wounds to the neck using a selective conservative approach. Haemodynamically stable patients were investigated with angiography. Only when this proved to be positive, the patient was surgically explored. The records of 116 patients presenting with a gunshot to the neck to our trauma unit over a 3-year-period were reviewed. We studied demographics, bullet track, clinical findings, diagnostic investigations, methods of treatment, time in hospital and outcome. Seventy of the 116 patients sustained a direct hit to the neck, in 46 patients the bullet traversed the face or chest first. Eighty-five patients presented with vascular injury, 61 with an injury to the airway, 32 with an injury to the pharynx or oesophagus, and 12 with sustained neurological damage. Angiography was performed in 89 patients and was positive in 12 patients. Lesions occurred in the common carotid artery (seven), the internal carotid artery (three), the external carotid artery (three), the vertebral artery (two) and the subclavian artery (one). Five patients had more than one lesion. In total 18 patients were treated operatively by performing a neck exploration. Four patients had emergency surgery for exsanguinating bleed. Fourteen had surgery after a positive diagnostic study 12 after angiography, 2 after another positive investigation. Ten (8.6%) patients died
