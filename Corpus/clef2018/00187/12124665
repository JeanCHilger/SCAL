Management of immature heterotopic ossification (HO) of the hip. A case of extensive heterotopic ossification involving the left hip in a 16 year old girl who sustained non traumatic spinal paralysis at T4 ASIA scale A. This case demonstrates the practical difficulties facing clinicians involved in the rehabilitation of this paraplegic patient who required intervention before full maturation of her left hip heterotopic ossification (HO). The patient was developing a rapidly progressive fixed scoliosis and severe difficulty in achieving a proper seating posture. In addition there was difficulty with the application of a suitable orthosis to try and limit the progression of scoliosis as a result of the HO. Discussants will comment on heterotopic ossification in general and the course of action in this particular case.
