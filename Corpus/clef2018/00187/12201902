Problems in early diagnosis of bladder cancer in a spinal cord injury patient: report of a case of simultaneous production of granulocyte colony stimulating factor and parathyroid hormone-related protein by squamous cell carcinoma of urinary bladder. Typical symptoms and signs of a clinical condition may be absent in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.A male with paraplegia was passing urine through penile sheath for 35 years, when he developed urinary infections. There was no history of haematuria. Intravenous urography showed bilateral hydronephrosis. The significance of abnormal outline of bladder was not appreciated. As there was large residual urine, he was advised intermittent catheterisation. Serum urea: 3.5 mmol/L creatinine: 77 umol/L. A year later, serum urea: 36.8 mmol/lThis case demonstrates how delay in diagnosis of bladder cancer could occur in a SCI patient due to absence of characteristic symptoms and signs.
