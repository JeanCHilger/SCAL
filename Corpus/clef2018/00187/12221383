Sex-dependent differences in the craniofacial morphology of children with a sleep-related breathing disorder. The purpose of this article was to compare the craniofacial morphology and hyoid bone position of preschool girls and boys with sleep-related breathing disorder (SBD).The control groups consisted of girls and boys without ear, nose, and throat disorders. After lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken, the children were selected on the basis of the head position in relation to the true horizontal. Thirty-eight cephalometric variables were determined. RESULTS The findings indicate that boys with SBD had a larger anterior lower facial height and a more anterior hyoid bone position than girls with SBD. However, the distance between the third cervical vertebra and the hyoid bone was a constant value among girls and boys with SBD. Girls with SBD had a sagittally narrower pharyngeal airway space than boys with SBD.These findings suggest that boys with SBD have a skeletal risk factor, whereas girls with SBD have an airway risk factor. In conclusion, the difference in risk factors may have some bearing on the greater incidence of SBD in both boys and men.
