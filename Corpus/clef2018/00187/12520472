Diagnosis and treatment of foregut duplications. In its broadest sense, the term, foregut duplication encompasses the full spectrum of developmental aberrations of the embryonic foregut (bronchopulmonary and alimentary tract). Evidence is emerging that the notochord may have a pivotal role to play in foregut development through the Shh-GLi signalling pathway. The investigation and management of these lesions depends on the clinical presentation and the level of the foregut affected. The presentation of symptomatic foregut duplications also depends on any space-occupying effect they exert and where specific complications related to the malformation occur, such as when the mucosal lining contains acid-secreting cells. In a minority of cases, (eg, where they cause respiratory compromise or spinal cord compression) urgent intervention is required. In the remainder, precise diagnostic imaging according to the level and location of the foregut duplication provides the necessary information to plan surgical excision of the lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging best shows the relationships of complex bronchopulmonary foregut malformations and associated anomalies of the spine. eg, neurenteric canal. Most lesions can be excised with minimal morbidity. Minimal-access surgical techniques can be applied to the simpler cysts, particularly some bronchogenic cysts. Thoraco-abdominal duplications and neurenteric cysts require careful preoperative delineation and more complex surgery.
