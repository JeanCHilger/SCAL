Ischaemic stroke from dissection of the craniocervical arteries in childhood: report of 12 patients. Dissection of craniocervical arteries is the most common non-atherosclerotic cause of stroke in young adults. During childhood, it is described primarily as isolated reports. Among 59 patients with arterial ischaemic stroke seen consecutively in the same institution, 12 had a dissection of a cervical or cerebral artery. The diagnosis was established through imaging features. The dissection involved the cervical arteries in five patients and intracranial arteries in seven. A cervical or facial trauma preceded the onset of cerebral ischaemic symptoms in four patients with extracranial dissection by a few minutes to 10 days. For another six patients, the stroke occurred during physical exertion. The neurological deficit was preceded or associated with an intense headache or neck pain in nine patients. Initial treatment consisted of anticoagulation therapy in two patients with extracranial dissection, and aspirin in nine. There was only one recurrence of stroke after a mean follow-up of 3 years and 6 months. Four patients had persistent disabling neurological deficit. Dissection of cervical or cerebral arteries appears to be a common cause of stroke in childhood.
