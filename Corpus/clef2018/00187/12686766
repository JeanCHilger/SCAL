Craniocervical anomalies in Dubowitz syndrome. Three cases and a literature review. Dubowitz syndrome is a disorder involving craniofacial abnormalities, growth retardation and mental retardation. Approximately 142 cases have been reported, with various associated other anomalies. These include cardiovascular, urogenital and endocrine abnormalities, as well as a predisposition to infections and hematological malignancies. Scoliosis has been described in association with this syndrome, as have isolated vertebral abnormalities. There has, however, been no description of craniocervical abnormalities. We describe three Dubowitz patients with significant craniocervical abnormalities.
