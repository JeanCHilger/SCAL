The neurogenic bladder: anatomy and neurophysiology. Micturition disorders secondary to alterations of complex neural controls do not represent a separate, typified condition but frequently they are symptoms of more complex diseases. Unfortunately, they are often misunderstood leading to severe damages to the patient. In diagnostic imaging of neural alterations of micturition, a major role is played by voiding cystourethrography for its contribution to both the morphologic and functional aspects. The dynamics of micturition is documented by voiding cystourethrography and with the integration between radiologic morphofunctional imaging and urodynamic pressure values the type and level of the neural lesion can be better defined. Therefore, subsequent neuroradiologic study can be specifically planned. Modern diagnostic imaging allows ready detection of the frequent complications of neurogenic bladder as diverticula, lithiasis, inflammation, that, especially in some patients, if misunderstood, can be particularly severe.
