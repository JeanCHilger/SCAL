Solitary eosinophilic granuloma of the cervicothoracic junction causing neurological deficit. We report a case of spinal eosinophilic granuloma with aggressive course. Initially, a conservative management was decided upon, but neurological deterioration of the patient prompted us to undertake a more aggressive attitude, with surgical excision and postoperative radiotherapy. The clinical and radiological features, and the different options of treatment are discussed, and the literature is reviewed.
