Hydatid disease of the spine in South African children. We present three patients with neurologic complications of the spine from hydatid disease. The first was a 6-year-old girl with lower limb paralysis evolving over 2 weeks. Neuroimaging revealed a cystic mass compressing the spinal cord at the level of T8 and extending from the vertebral body. She underwent surgical decompression. Histopathologic examination confirmed hydatid disease. At 6-month follow-up, functional improvement had occurred with full ambulation. She continues on long-term albendazole therapy. Two other patients are described, one with primary spinal disease and the other with cerebral disease and secondary seeding to the spine. Spinal hydatid disease is a rarity, even more so in children. Although secondary disease, primarily affecting bone, carries a poorer long-term outlook, the first patient made a dramatic recovery and has raised therapeutic dilemmas as to the total duration of continuing albendazole therapy. The literature documents some 37 reports, mostly in adults. Considering the frequency of hydatid disease in South Africa, the incidence in our population could be under-recorded. Unless the clinician includes spinal hydatid disease, in endemic areas, as part of the differential list for paralysis and considers performing neuroimaging, this potentially treatable diagnosis will be missed.
