Old spinal cord injury treated by pulsed electric stimulation. From March 1989 to May 1990, 80 cases of old spinal cord injury were treated with pulsed electric stimulation. The pulsed electric field was formed by utilizing paradural needle electrodes positioned cephalad and caudad to the site of spinal cord injury, with the stimulator connected with the electrodes being turned on. This stimulation was given 30 minutes once daily. 13 cases were treated for 3-6 months, 57 for 6-12 months, and 10 for 12-18 months. The nerve functions recovered in 78.5% of the cases (63/80), with the rate of useful recovery of 47.5% (38/80). The rate of EMG and gait improvement were 75.5% and 77.7%, respectively. The effect of pulsed electric stimulations was related to the extent of spinal cord injury, the depth and position of needle electrodes, the frequency and intensity of pulsed current and whether the spinal cord was compressed.
