Anesthesia management for spine surgery using spinal navigation in combination with computed tomography. The development of a spine surgery using neuronavigation with intraoperative computed tomography (CT) is of benefit to the patient. However, the procedure also has a major impact on anesthesia management. During the procedure, the patient remains in the prone position on the CT examination table and is moved extensively during CT scans. Furthermore, there is inadequate separation between operating field and anesthetic area. Problems encountered during the procedure were patient positioning, limited patient access, long tubing, and therefore the need for adequate monitoring. We report our experience using this approach in 35 patients with spinal fracture, spinal degeneration, and tumor and describe a step-by-step anesthetic management protocol that has been developed as a guideline for use in spinal neuronavigation with intraoperative CT at our center.
