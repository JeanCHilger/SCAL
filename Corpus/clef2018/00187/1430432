Midline anterior atlas clefts: CT findings. Anterior atlas clefts (AACs) are rare developmental variants that may mimic fractures. Due to the potential severe implications of craniocervical junction trauma, expeditious differentiation between a Jefferson burst fracture and a congenital cleft is essential in trauma patients. Three cases of AAC are presented. Two cases demonstrated incidental AACs the third case was associated with a Jefferson burst injury. Computed tomography is most helpful in evaluating the integrity of the atlas
