A comparison between M.R.I. and C.T. in acute spinal trauma. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 0.3T and Computed Tomography (CT) were compared in the retrospective evaluation of 34 patients with acute spinal cord injury. MRI was highly accurate in the imaging of vertebral body fracture, and spondylitic changes, and is the method of choice for imaging ligament injury, traumatic disc protrusion and spinal cord compression. It was also useful for the identification of subtle subluxations in the sagittal plane. CT remains the method of choice for imaging neural arch fractures. MRI at 0.3T is a valid technique for assessing patients with acute spinal trauma.
