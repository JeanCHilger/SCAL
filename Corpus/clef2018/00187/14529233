Epidemiology of trauma deaths. This study was done to highlight the pattern and distribution of trauma deaths in a Nigerian teaching hospital in order to enhance trauma research, improve treatment strategies and prevent trauma deaths.a prospective data collection was done for 24 months beginning September 1999 detailing the age, sex, occupation, diagnosis, mechanism of trauma, injury-arrival time, and circumstances of death and determining retrospectively the severity of trauma using Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS).There were 129 deaths but 84 (65.1%) had sufficient data for trauma scoring. Male:Female ratio was 60:24 = 2.5:1. The age range was 2.95 years, mean 36.8 +/- 15.2 years for males and 45.5 +/- 23.0 years for females. Two thirds (66.7%) of the deaths occurred among traders/business 27.4%, artisans 20.2%, drivers and students 9.5% each. Three quarters of the deaths (75.0%, 63) were in patients involved in road traffic accidents (RTA) followed by violent trauma (10.7%), falls 9.5% and burns 4.8%. The trauma deaths include head injury (26 deaths, 31.0%), multiple injuries (30.0%), fractures (13.1%), cervical spine injury (10.7), gunshot injuries (8.3%), burns (4.8%) and others (5.0%). Sixty-two patients (73.8%) reached the hospital within 6 hours of the injury. The patients were brought by the Police, Good Samaritans or relatives in nearly equal proportions. The mean RTS, ISS and TRISS probability of survival scores were 5.16, 25 and 67% for males but 6.0, 22 and 75% for females, respectively.The pattern and distribution of trauma revealed a typical trauma death is a male aged below 40 years, who is a trader/businessman involved in RTA or violent trauma. Despite a probability of survival above 60% and majority of the patients getting to hospital within 6 hours, the inadequate A and E care has thrown up possibilities for prevention of trauma death, improving treatment strategies and enhancing trauma research.
