Spinal tumors: clinical aspects, classification and surgical treatment. Spinal tumors are classified in intradural and extradural tumors. Most extradural spinal tumors are metastasis. The other spinal tumors are rare and mostly benign. Only about 5% of tumors of the nervous system are spinal tumors. Their symptomatology is often insidious and the diagnosis can be difficult. Magnetic resonance imaging has revolutionized their diagnosis. The lesions within the spinal cord can now be directly visualized. The treatment of these tumors mostly require surgery. It has been proven that surgical results are better if these tumors are operated as soon as neurological symptoms have appeared. In our series of 39 operated intradural tumors we noted a functional improvement in 46.5% of the cases, a stabilisation in 43.5% and a deterioration in 10%.
