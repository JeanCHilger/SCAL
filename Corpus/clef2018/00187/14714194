Intramedullary spinal cord cavernous malformations: report of ten new cases. Spinal cord cavernous malformations (SCCM), once thought to be extremely rare, have been diagnosed more frequently since the advent of MRI. In addition to the six personal cases surgically treated between 1992 and 1993 and already described in the literature, the authors report here a further ten cases operated on between April 1993 and January 2001. These involved five males and five females whose ages at operation ranged from 12 to 69 years. The SCCM were thoracic in five patients and cervical in five. In seven cases, the malformations bulged on the surface of the pia mater, while in the other three there was subpial discoloration due to the presence of hemosiderin. Removal was total in all cases. After surgery, two patients presented transient worsening of preoperative paraparesis. At follow-up ranging from 2.2 to 9.2 years (mean 5.7), nine patients had made complete motor recovery while one, in whom preoperative paraparesis had been severe, remained stationary. At least one follow-up MRI investigation was performed in each patient 6 to 12 months after operation. As previously reported, the authors confirm that the treatment of choice for symptomatic SCCM is total surgical excision in order to avoid recurrences and the possibility of further hemorrhage. Surgical outcome combines low mortality with a high probability of functional recovery, especially when paraparesis is not severe and of relatively recent onset.
