Intramedullary hemorrhage in a neonate after lumbar puncture resulting in paraplegia: a case report. We present the case of a premature infant with decreased spontaneous movement of the lower extremities. Imaging was demonstrative of a lesion of the conus medullaris. Operatively and with histologic confirmation, the mass was determined to be a blood clot originating from the conus. Retrospectively, the patient had a known lumbar puncture. There were no clotting abnormalities in this patient. At long-term follow-up, the child continues to have lower extremity paresis and incontinence of bowel and bladder. Clinicians should consider the lower termination of the conus medullaris in the infant, especially in the preterm infant.
