Association between vertical development of the cervical spine and the face in subjects with varying vertical facial patterns. The upper cervical spine and face were compared longitudinally from 6 to 15 years of age in 2 groups of children with low (n = 16) and high (n = 14) MP-SN angles. The purpose of the study was to assess morphological and incremental associations between the vertical development of the cervical spine and the face in subjects with varying vertical facial patterns. Morphological associations were not detected during the observation period. Long faces were found on children with short necks, and short, square faces on those with long necks. Vertical growth of the upper cervical spine and face were weakly correlated in the 6-to-12-year period but strongly correlated later during puberty. The vertical distance between gonion and the body of the second cervical vertebra was remarkable for its constancy during childhood and puberty, indicating that gonion and the second cervical vertebra body were anatomically interrelated. This anatomical relationship strongly suggests that a mutual relationship also exists between vertical growth of the upper cervical spine and the face, especially the lower face. In addition, the lower face had the ability for independent vertical growth that was not coordinated with vertical cervical growth. This was the case in the 6-to-12-year period, but not later.
