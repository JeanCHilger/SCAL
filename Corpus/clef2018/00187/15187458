Cervical spine injuries in children. Cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents are rare. Common mechanisms include motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, fall from height, and gunshot injuries. Cervical spine injuries are classified by Allen and Ferguson according to the period they occur, as infantile, early juvenile, and late juvenile. Anatomically, two main types are defined as occipitoatlantal (upper cervical) and subaxial injuries. The purpose of this paper is to review cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents with respect to epidemiology, injury mechanisms, diagnosis, clinical and radiologic aspects, and treatment in the light of the current literature.
