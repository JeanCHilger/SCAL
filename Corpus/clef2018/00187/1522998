Return to work after spinal cord injury: the potential contribution of physical fitness. The history, physical characteristics and fitness status of 60 persons who had sustained a spinal cord injury at least 3 years previously were considered in relation to current occupation. All subjects had completed their education, 39 being gainfully employed and 21 unemployed. The general characteristics of the sample, mainly beneficiaries of the Quebec Automobile Insurance Plan, were typical of spinal cord injured individuals in North America. The working group had a significantly higher current level of education than those who were unemployed (p less than .01). In terms of physical fitness, the workers were lighter, with a lower body mass index and a higher aerobic power (p less than .05). Isokinetic testing suggested a trend toward a higher peak torque in the workers. The total work performed (Nm.kg-1) during an isokinetic endurance test (25 biphasic contraction at 180 degrees.sec-1) was significantly higher in the workers, suggesting that such muscular endurance might be even more useful than greater peak isokinetic strength during vocational activities. However, the likelihood of employment was unrelated to habitual patterns of either aerobic exercise or overall physical activity. No significant differences of physical fitness or physical activity habits were found between workers holding sedentary versus physically demanding jobs. The results verified the positive relationship between physical fitness (body composition, aerobic power, muscular endurance) and the gainful employment of paraplegics, but failed to show any significant relationship between physical fitness and the acceptance of physically demanding work by such individuals.
