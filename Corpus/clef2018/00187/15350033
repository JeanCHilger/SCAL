Imaging of sacral tumors. Sacral tumors are somewhat unique to the skeletal system in that the prevalence of various neoplasms is different from that at other osseous sites. There are also unique imaging-related considerations, related in part to diagnosis, but particularly to the evaluation site for tumor biopsy sampling and resection. In this report, the authors describe imaging features of the most common sacral lesions, provide numerous radiological examples, and give suggestions for optimal imaging of this region of the body.
