Anterior approach in low cervical fractures prodited by hyperflexion or tear drop. Hyperflexion or teardrop fracture of low cervical vertebrae is characterised by ligament affectation of the entire intervertebral segment, the vertebral body, primarily its anteroinferior third and, frequently, spinal medullar affectation. This series presents the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, surgical approach, and post surgical evolution in 30 patients with tear drop fractures. Over the last 30 years, thirty patients with tear drop fractures at the low cervical spine (C3-C7) were admitted to our Neurosurgical Service. Diagnostic studies included simple radiographs, computerised axial tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), all of which evidenced the instability of the damaged segment due to osteoligamentous affectation, and a primarily vertebral body fracture. Patients' neurological status was according to the Frankel' scale adapted to the American Spinal Injury Association scale (ASIA). 11 patients were included in grade A, 5 in B, 3 in grade C, 2 in grade D and 9 grade E of neurological affectation. Surgery through an anterior approach was performed, an average of 5 days after placement of halo traction, which had been placed on admission to the hospital. Surgery consisted in vertebral corporectomy and placement of a plate and a graft from the iliac crest. The patients' neurological evolution was favourable in all cases with incomplete medullar lesions. There were 11 patients with complete lesions, or Frankel grade A affectation two died due to other associated lesions and the other nine showed no neurological improvement after surgery. The degree of arthrodesis was good and only one patient required an a combined anterior-posterior approach. We conclude that teardrop fractures were associated with severe neurological affectation in more than 50% of our patients, and that these fractures provoke instability requiring arthrodesis, generally via an anterior approach.
