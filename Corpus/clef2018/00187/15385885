Surgical excision of symptomatic lumbar spinous process pseudoarthrosis. Isolated spinous process fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine are not well described in the literature. Initial conservative treatment of these fractures can result in resolution of symptoms without lasting effect. However, in cases where localized pain persists despite appropriate treatment, pseudoarthrosis should be suspected.The diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcome of one patient with isolated pseudoarthrosis of the lumbar spine that failed conservative treatment and was surgically excised are reviewed.Following excision of the spinous process pseudoarthrosis, the patient's pain resolved, allowing return to competitive sports without limitation.In certain cases, excision of an isolated spinous process pseudoarthrosis can improve patients' back pain. However, prior to surgery, conservative treatment must be exhausted and other causes of back pain must be ruled out.
