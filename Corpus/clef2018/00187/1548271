Biterminal tenotomy for the treatment of congenital muscular torticollis. Long-term results. Fifty-five patients who, in a twenty-eight-year period, had been managed with a biterminal open release because of congenital muscular torticollis, were re-examined at an average of fifteen years and a minimum of five years after the operation. Forty-eight patients reported no functional or cosmetic impairment. Palpable soft-tissue strands remained in twenty-nine patients, but bending toward the untreated side was limited more than 10 degrees in only one patient. The rate of recurrence was 2 per cent. Facial asymmetry improved or resolved in more than one-half of the patients. We recommend that biterminal release be performed at the age of three to five years in all patients who do not respond to non-operative treatment.
