Pasteurella multocida meningitis and cervical spine osteomyelitis in a neonate. A 20-day-old male infant presented with fever, decreased alertness and quadriparesis as a result of Pasteurella multocida meningitis and C1-2 vertebral osteomyelitis. Although his household contained 2 pet cats, there was no history of bites, scratches or licks. We speculate that colonization of the nasopharynx was followed by contiguous spread to the retropharyngeal soft tissue, cervical vertebrae and meninges.
