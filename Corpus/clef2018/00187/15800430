Tectorial membrane injuries in children. We report three cases of tectorial membrane injury in children. An increased interspinous ratio was identified on cervical spine radiographs. The tectorial membrane injuries were diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. The three children were restrained passengers in high-speed motor vehicle accidents, and all sustained polytrauma. Two children with partial tears of the tectorial membrane were immobilized in a halo, and one with a longitudinal tear of the tectorial membrane had an occiput-to-C2 fusion.
