Extensive cervical spinal cord lesion with late foetal presentation. Neonatal cervical spinal cord injury occurring in the perinatal period is rare but has been described after both traumatic and atraumatic birth. Recently, a case of atraumatic, late third trimester, pre-labour presentation has been described. We report a second such case, but with important diagnostic differences and outcome. This case showed loss of foetal movements late in the third trimester. This was secondary to an extensive cervical lesion with no history of trauma. This emphasizes the need to consider cervical cord lesions when foetal or postnatal movements are reduced, even in the absence of trauma.
