Klippel-Feil syndrome. Klippel-Feil syndrome is characterized by congenital fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae and may be associated with other organ system anomalies. Although many congenital anomalies are of little clinical importance to the emergency physician, Klippel-Feil syndrome is associated with both spontaneous and progressive neurologic sequelae as well as a predisposition for serious neurologic injury after relatively minor neck trauma. Such patterns of skeletal abnormalities as an unstable fusion pattern, craniocervical anomalies, and associated spinal stenosis are associated with a higher risk of neurologic sequelae. We report the case of a patient with a previously undiagnosed type II Klippel-Feil syndrome who presented after neck trauma to illustrate how further diagnostic imaging modalities may be required to elucidate the presence or absence of acute injury. Key considerations in the emergency management of such patients include radiographic evaluation for hypermobile cervical segments, the anticipation of difficult tracheal intubation, and proper follow-up and referral because of the associated other organ system anomalies and progression of the skeletal pathology.
