Functional electric stimulation: its efficacy and safety in improving pulmonary function and musculoskeletal fitness. The efficacy and safety of functional electric stimulation (FES) in improving cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness in individuals with spinal cord injury was evaluated. Ten males and two females aged 16 to 46 years began an FES program from three months to 22 years after injury. Seven patients had paraplegia and five had quadriplegia. The FES protocol consisted of three phases: (1) leg extension, the stimulation of the quadriceps muscle group only, first without and then with weights (2) ergometry, the stimulation of quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteal muscles to produce a bicycling motion
