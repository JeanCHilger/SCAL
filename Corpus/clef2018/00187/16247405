Local plastic surgeries in the treatment of total burn cicatrical contractures of the neck. Results of treatment of 44 patients with total burn cicatrical contractures of the neck were analyzed. In all the cases deformation of the neck was corrected by plasty with contradirectional myofascial flaps from cicatrical tissues. Clinical characteristics of burn cicatrices helped determine criteria for their using in plastic surgery. The method may be used both as a final variant of neck plastic repair and as a preparatory stage before other methods of surgical reconstructions.
