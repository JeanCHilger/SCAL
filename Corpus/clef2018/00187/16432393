Reasons for rehospitalization in patients with spinal cord injury: 5 years' experience. The aim of this study was to determine the causes of rehospitalization in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) treated in Istanbul Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Centre and to compare the data with previous studies. Patients who were rehospitalized after an initial phase of rehabilitation between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2001 were enrolled into the study. SCI patients aged 17 years or over at the time of injury were included. This retrospective study was designed using our medical records. In 5 years, 733 SCI patients were treated and 56 of them experienced rehospitalization. We examined the demographic and injury characteristics of rehospitalized patients with SCI. The SPSS computer programme was used for statistical analysis. We found that the rate of rehospitalization was 7.6%, the length of stay (LOS) was 72.21 days and the average age was 34.25 years. The reasons for rehospitalization were, in descending order, spasticity 25%, additional rehabilitation 21.4%, pressure sores 17.9%, urinary infection 16.1%, spinal surgery 8.9%, urinary system surgery 5.4% and pain 5.4%. Statistical significance was found between mean age and causes. The patients who were rehospitalized because of spinal surgery had a lower mean age than those rehospitalized because of pain (P=0.04, F=2.4). The most frequent reasons for rehospitalization of patients over 25 years old were spasticity and pressure sores. In conclusion, SCI patients' LOS was longer than found in previous studies because of a lack of efficient home rehabilitation. The most frequent cause of rehospitalization was spasticity, because of uncontrolled medical therapy. The study demonstrates how education of the patients and their families is important, and that home-based rehabilitation services must be established and supported by government.
