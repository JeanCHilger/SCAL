Imaging for evaluation of suspected cervical spine trauma: a 2-year analysis. To examine the role of radiography in screening trauma patients with suspected injury to the cervical spine.Over a period of 2 years, 5172 people were admitted to our trauma service and 297 (5.4%) were found to have cervical fractures. The radiographic and CT films and reports of 245 of these 297 patients were reviewed.The 245 subjects had sustained 309 distinct individual injuries. Radiography detected injuries in 108 cases (44.1%) and CT detected injuries in 243 cases (99.2%). The two fractures missed by CT occurred at C2 one fracture was obscured by dental artefacts and the other was in the horizontal plane of the scan. Both fractures were detected on lateral radiographs of the region.CT is superior to radiography for identification of cervical spine fractures. The fractures most likely to be missed by CT occur at C2. We recommend that CT be used as the primary screening method for people with suspected cervical injury, together with a single lateral view of the cervical spine to include the C2 region.
