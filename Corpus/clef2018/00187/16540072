Injury potential of a three-year-old Hybrid III dummy in forward and rearward facing positions under CMVSS 208 testing conditions. This research focuses on the injury potential of children in forward and rearward facing child restraint seats in frontal collisions. Vehicle crash tests were completed following the guidelines outlined in the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 using a Hybrid III three-year-old dummy in a convertible forward/rearward facing child restraint seat. The seat was equipped with a five-point restraining system and the experimental test was completed in the forward facing configuration. A numerical model employing a similar set-up as the experimental crash test was developed and numerically simulated using LS-DYNA. To verify the numerical simulations, the head and chest accelerations as well as neck loads and moments were compared to the experimental findings and it was observed that a reasonable correlation between the experimental and numerical observations existed. Further numerical simulations were completed to investigate the influence of positioning the three-year-old dummy in the rearward configuration on the head and neck injury potential during frontal crash. Through an analysis of injury criteria, using neck loads and head accelerations, it was observed that the rearward facing child dummy sustained significantly lower levels of neck injury criteria while exhibiting similar levels of the head injury criteria as the forward facing child dummy.
