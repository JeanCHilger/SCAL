Ultrasound-guided spinal fracture repositioning, ligamentotaxis, and remodeling after thoracolumbar burst fractures. Computed tomography aided evaluation of spinal decompression by ultrasound-guided spinal fracture repositioning, ligamentotaxis, and remodeling after thoracolumbar burst fractures.To determine the necessity of spinal canal widening by ultrasound-guided fracture repositioning for fractures with and without neurologic deficit.Ultrasound-guided spinal fracture repositioning is an alternative new approach. Reports have varied concerning ligamentotaxis and remodeling.Computed tomography aided planimetry of the spinal canal (64 consecutive burst fractures) and neurologic evaluation by Frankel grades.Ultrasound-guided spinal fracture repositioning (n = 37) reduced the stenosis of the spinal canal area from 45% before surgery to 20% after surgery of the estimated original area. Fifteen patients had a primary neurologic deficit, which improved markedly in 11 cases after treatment. Patients with neurologic symptoms had a greater preoperative spinal stenosis than those without. No correlation was seen between the degree of pretreatment spinal stenosis, fracture type, and severity of the neurologic deficit. Ligamentotaxis (n = 27) reduced the stenosis from 30% before surgery to 18% after surgery and remodeling (n = 11) from 25% after surgery to 13% after metal removal.Ultrasound-guided fracture repositioning is an efficient method for spinal canal decompression of burst fractures with neurologic symptoms. The marked degree of widening of the spinal canal due to the effects of ligamentotaxis and remodeling may render the reposition of retropulsed fragments unnecessary in cases of fractures without a neurologic deficit.
