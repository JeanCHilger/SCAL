Multiple spinal extradural arachnoid cysts occurring in a child. Case report. Symptomatic multiple extradural arachnoid cysts of the spine are extremely uncommon in children and have only rarely been reported. The authors report a case of multiple extradural spinal arachnoid cysts in a 14-year-old child who presented with signs of spinal cord compression. The disease affected the thoracic spine and extended from T-5 to T-10 with an underlying defect in the dura of the spinal canal that was predisposed to the formation of cysts. The authors describe the imaging examination, surgical planning, and surgical technique, and they review the literature. They also discuss the possible mechanisms of cyst formation.
