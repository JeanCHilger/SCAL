Symptomatic Chiari type I malformation after radiation therapy in an infant: case report. One previous case report has described the development of a Chiari I malformation in a child after fractionated radiation therapy to the anterior cranial base. The authors present an additional case of a 17-month-old girl treated for an isolated, malignant, rhabdoid tumor of the right neck with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical exploration, and radiation therapy.The patient developed a Chiari I malformation and cervical syringomyelia 1.5 years after the treatment. The patient experienced two episodes of unresponsiveness before diagnosis, and the malformation was then identified on magnetic resonance imaging scans.Suboccipital decompressive craniectomy, and C1 laminectomy with autologous duraplasty were performed.Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed reconstitution of cerebrospinal fluid at the foramen magnum and ascent of the cerebellar tonsils. The patient remains asymptomatic 5.5 years after treatment.The importance of this association is discussed in the context of the increasing use of radiation therapy in young children and infants.
