Computed tomographic evaluation of the odontoid process for two-screw fixation in type-II fracture: a Malaysian perspective. To measure the diameter of the odontoid process in a Malaysian population using computed tomographic (CT) scan and determine the feasibility of treating type-II odontoid fractures using 2 cortical screws.CT images of the odontoid process of 85 patients aged 18 to 80 years were analysed 69 (81%) were male (mean age, 44 years) and 16 (19%) were female (mean age, 48 years). Both anteroposterior (AP) and transverse diameters of the odontoid process were measured via axial CT images at 3 different levels: the base of the odontoid process and 1.2 mm and 2.4 mm above the base.The mean AP and transverse diameters of the odontoid process in men were 11.3 (range, 10.0-12.6 standard deviation [SD], 0.7) mm and 10.2 (range, 8.5-12.3Two 3.5-mm cortical screws appear too big for fixation in one third of our sample presenting with type-II odontoid fracture. Fixation by two 2.7-mm screws is recommended for Malaysians and other Asian populations.
