Use of capsaicin in the treatment of radicular pain in spinal cord injury. Pain following spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common problem and can interfere with functional recovery. Radicular pain (pain at the level of injury) is one type of SCI pain. Traditional analgesic agents are sometimes ineffective and can have significant systemic side effects.A retrospective review of 8 patients with radicular pain secondary to SCI who responded to topical capsaicin therapy.Improvement was noted in 1-2 weeks, including 1 patient with a 12-year history of intractable pain. Long-term efficacy was seen in 2 patients treated for >2 years.Based on these favorable results and minimal side effects, topical capsaicin should be considered in the treatment of localized radicular pain secondary to SCI.
