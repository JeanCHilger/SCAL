Cervical spine tuberculosis in children. The presentation and outcome of pediatric cervical spine tuberculosis are different from those of adult cervical spine tuberculosis. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiographic outcome of 58 children with cervical spine tuberculosis treated nonoperatively and operatively between 1996 and 2004. The mean age was 3.7 years (range, 1.9-14 years). The cervicodorsal junction was affected in 27 children, the atlantoaxial complex in 19 children, and the mid-cervical spine in 12 children. Multifocal noncontiguous spinal lesions were observed in 21 patients. Surgery was performed in 25 children for: neurologic deficit (14) drainage of retropharyngeal abscesses (four)
