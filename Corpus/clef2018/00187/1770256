Posterolateral approach to the atlas and the axis. We have developed a new surgical approach to the atlas and the axis including the odontoid process, in which the vertebral artery is transposed and an access to their lateral aspects without exposing the anterior structures of the neck is achieved. A case of successful excision of a bone tumor of the lateral mass of the atlas and a hypertrophic odontoid process by this approach is described.
