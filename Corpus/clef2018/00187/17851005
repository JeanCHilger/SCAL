Penetrating air gun wound in the neck. Injuries from air weapons can be serious and potentially fatal. It has been estimated that up to four million such weapons exist in UK households.We present the case of an 8-year-old boy who sustained a penetrating neck wound from an air gun. Use of the flexible laryngoscope in the resuscitation room allowed localization of the gun pellet in the airway.This approach, combined with careful clinical assessment led to immediate removal by direct laryngoscopy, thus avoiding the morbidity of unnecessary surgical exploration.
