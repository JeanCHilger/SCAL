Psychosocial adjustment patterns of persons with spinal cord injury in Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychosocial adjustment patterns of a community sample of persons with spinal cord injury in Taiwan.A total of 102 participants were recruited from the Association of People with Spinal Cord Injury in Taipei City. Mean age of participants was 30.8 years (SD=11.39 years), and 77% were men. The participants were asked to complete a research packet containing a demographic questionnaire, the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self Report Questionnaire, and the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire.Four distinct groups were found, representing different levels of psychosocial adjustment: (i) Well adjusted, (ii) Moderately adjusted, (iii) Moderately adjusted and sexually inexperienced, and (iv) Poorly adjusted. Employment status, age at the time of onset, injury level, and current age, as well as the motivational and behavioural aspects of coping, were identified as the functions discriminating the groups based on the demographic characteristics and sense of coherence, respectively.Vocational, sexual, and leisure areas of adjustment were found to be the most problematic for individuals with SCI in Taiwan. Counseling and other rehabilitation intervention efforts should focus on these identified needs of people with SCI in Taiwan.
