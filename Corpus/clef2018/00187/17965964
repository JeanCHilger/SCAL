Effect of gonadal status on bone mineral density and radiological spinal deformities in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adult patients is associated with marked decrease in bone turnover, low bone mass and high risk of clinical and subclinical fractures. We investigated whether the prevalence of spinal deformities in adults with GHD was related to the gonadal status of patients. A total of 89 adult hypopituitary patients with severe GHD were evaluated for bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral deformities (quantitative morphometric analysis). At the study entry, 54 patients were eugonadic whereas 35 patients were hypogonadic without replacement treatment. Radiological spinal deformities were found in 55 patients (61.8%) with higher prevalence in untreated (56 cases) versus treated (33 cases) GHD patients. Eugonadic and hypogonadic patients showed no significant difference in spinal deformities although T-score was significantly lower in hypogonadic as compared with eugonadic patients. Gonadal function was not correlated with the occurrence of spinal deformities which was instead inversely correlated with rhGH treatment. In conclusion, gonadal status may influence BMD in adult patients with GHD without affecting the risk to develop vertebral deformities. Conversely, rhGH replacement treatment seems to be the only factor influencing the risk to develop vertebral deformities in adult GHD patients.
