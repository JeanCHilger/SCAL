Post-traumatic atlantoaxial rotatory fixation in an adult: a case report. A case report.To describe an interesting patient who underwent open reduction and C1-C2 transpedicular screw fixation with interspinous wiring due to high-riding vertebral artery.Atlantoaxial rotatory fixation (AARF) is a rare complication found most frequently after trauma in children and young adults the clinical diagnosis is difficult and often made late.We report a case of post-traumatic AARF associated with a facet fracture in an adult. Reduction proved difficult to obtain by skull traction and gentle manipulation. Therefore, after open reduction under general anesthesia, we performed C1-C2 transpedicular screw fixation with posterior wiring to avoid vertebral artery injury due to high-riding transverse foramen at the C2 vertebra.The normal atlantoaxial relation was restored and the torticollis resolved. The patient remains neurologically intact and has radiographic documentation of fusion.Although technically demanding, C1-C2 transpedicular screw fixation combined with interspinous bone graft wiring after open reduction may be an alternative treatment option if conservative treatment fails to reduce AARF.
