Transverse sacral fractures with anterior displacement. Transverse fractures of the sacrum with anterior displacement are the rarest type of transverse sacral fractures. They usually occur at the S1-S2 region in suicide jumpers. A clinical study was performed to evaluate the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of transverse sacral fractures with anterior displacement. We present six patients with a transverse fracture of the sacrum with anterior displacement. All patients presented with bowel and bladder dysfunction, perineal anesthesia, sensory and motor deficits at the lower extremities. Prompt diagnosis of the sacral fracture was obtained in five of the six patients. Operative treatment including lumbosacral laminectomies, spine instrumentation and fusion was done in all patients. Neurological recovery was almost complete in one patient, incomplete in four patients, and none in one patient. Although reduction of the fracture was not ideal in many of these patients, long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up, and neurological improvement were rewarding.
