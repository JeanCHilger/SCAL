Occipitocervical contoured rod stabilization: does it still have a role amidst the modern stabilization techniques? The occipitocervical contoured rod (CR) stabilization for use in craniovertebral junction (CVJ) pathologies is an effective and economical technique of posterior fusion (PF).The various indications for CR in CVJ pathologies are discussed.Retrospective analysis.Fifty-four patients (mean age: 31.02+/-13.44 years male: female ratio=5.75:1) who underwent CR stabilization are included. The majority had congenital atlantoaxial dislocation (AADTwenty-four patients improved, 18 stabilized and six deteriorated at a mean follow-up (FU) of 17.78+/-19.75 (2-84) months. Six patients were lost to FU. In 37 patients with a FU of at least three months, stability and bony union could be assessed. Thirty-one of them achieved a bony fusion/stable construct.Contoured rod is especially useful for PF in cases of congenital AAD with coexisting CIM, cervical scoliosis, sub-axial instability and/or asymmetrical facet joints. In acquired pathologies with three-column instability, inclusion of joints one level above the affected one by using CR, especially enhances stability.
