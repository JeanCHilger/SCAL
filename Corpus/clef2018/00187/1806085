Atlantoaxial mobility after screw fixation of the odontoid: a computed tomographic study. Between 1979 and 1989, anterior screw fixation of the odontoid process was performed in 16 patients with fractures of the odontoid. One patient died suddenly 2 days after the operation. Postmortem examination could not disclose the cause of death. No other complication was noted. We followed 13 patients. At examinations 7 to 82 months after injury, all fractures were consolidated in reduced position. In all patients, a functional computed tomographic (CT) examination of the atlantoaxial rotation was performed. Atlantoaxial rotation measurement ranged from 7 to 38 degrees to the right (average: 25.2 degrees) and 7 to 41 degrees (average: 24.1 degrees) to the left side. Five patients presented a normal range of atlantoaxial rotation, 29 to 41 degrees 3 had a rotation of 20 to 28 degrees
