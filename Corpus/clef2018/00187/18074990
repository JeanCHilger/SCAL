Stress fractures in the adolescent athlete. Consider stress fracture as a diagnosis in adolescent athletes complaining of worsening vague pain without a clear mechanism of injury. Remember that initial radiographs may be normal, especially early in the clinical course. If the fracture is of low risk for delayed or non-union, conservative management is indicated, with repeat radiographs 2 weeks after initiation of treatment. If a high-risk fracture is suspected, early diagnosis with MRI, bone scan, and, in some cases, CT is important for surgical decision making.
