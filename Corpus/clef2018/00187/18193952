Oral breathing and head posture. To determine the head posture and cephalometric characteristics in oral breathing children.Lateral cephalograms taken in natural head posture of 35 oral breathing patients (OB) (mean age 8.8 +/- 2.2 years SD range 5-13 years) and of 35 patients with varied malocclusions and physiological breathing (PB) (mean age 9.7 +/- 1.6 years SDA Student's t-test showed that an increase in angles NSL/OPT (P = .000), NSL/CVT (P = .001), FH/OPT (P = .000), FH/CVT (P = .005), and NSL/VER (P = .000) a decrease in the distance MGP-CV1p (P = .0001)Our data suggest that OB children show greater extension of the head related to the cervical spine, reduced cervical lordosis, and more skeletal divergence, compared with PB subjects.
