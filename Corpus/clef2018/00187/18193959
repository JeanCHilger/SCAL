Cervical vertebrae anomalies-incidental findings on lateral cephalograms. Three cases of abnormal incidental findings on lateral cephalogram are presented. These patients reported for orthodontic consultation in their adolescence. While studying the patients' cephalograms, abnormal radiographic findings were discovered in their cervical vertebrae. Because the patients were asymptomatic, early diagnosis based on these radiographic findings made the patients aware of the situations. Lifestyle changes were instituted with specialist consultation in two patients to prevent or delay the onset of symptoms of an underlying pathology. Patients were educated about the likely future course of these findings. Specialist follow-up was advised to all the patients.
