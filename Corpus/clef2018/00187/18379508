Arterial and venous blood flow disturbances in children with vertebral basilar insufficiency. Two hundred and sixty-two patients aged from 1 month to 18 years with vertebral basilar insufficiency syndrome have been studied. This pathology is caused by the natal trauma of cervical spine and related structures, connective tissue dysplasias, anomalies of the spine, the cranial vertebral transition and spinal vessels. Basic clinical, X-ray and dopplerographic indices of vertebral basilar insufficiency (VBI) in children of different age groups have been specified. Statistically significant correlation between VBI, spinal arterial blood flow asymmetry and disturbance of the deep venous drainage were revealed. Reactivity coefficients for the functional loading in children of school age were calculated and their correlations with the autoregulation system and vessel reactivity were shown. These peculiarities of hemodynamics in children of different age should be taken into account in the choice of therapeutic and rehabilitative measures.
