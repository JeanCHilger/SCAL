A case of back pain associated with neurology in a young man. We present the case of a 14-year-old with a 3-month history of back pain, who on presentation, was demonstrated to have neurological signs.Investigation with radiographs and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which demonstrated an expansile lesion in the tenth thoracic vertebra with posterior extension causing spinal cord compression. This was treated with surgical resection and spinal cord decompression.Diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst was made following histopathological examination of the resected lesion.Back pain in childhood is a significant and often sinister symptom, which requires careful evaluation.
