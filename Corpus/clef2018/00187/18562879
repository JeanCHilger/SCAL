Blunt laryngeal trauma in children: case report and review of initial airway management. Blunt neck trauma is not common in children, but these injuries can be potentially life-threatening. Presenting symptoms and signs of laryngeal injuries are often subtle, and poor outcomes in regard to voice and airway function are associated with delayed diagnosis. The purpose of this report was to present a pediatric case that illustrates the subtle symptoms and signs of a laryngeal laceration. In this case, the appearance of the laryngeal laceration was similar to the glottis, highlighting the importance of developing airway management guidelines for blunt laryngeal injuries in children.
