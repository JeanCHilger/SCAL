Pelvic teratoma with extensive spinal involvement in a neonate: an important differential diagnosis. A 6-week-old girl presented with an abdominal mass and spinal cord compression. Clinical and radiological features indicated a diagnosis of congenital neuroblastoma. Histology revealed a diagnosis of germ cell tumour after therapy for neuroblastoma had been commenced. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first reported case of paediatric dumbbell retroperitoneal teratoma.
