Kyphoplasty : method for minimally invasive treatment of painful vertebral fractures. Painful osteoporotic and malignant vertebral fractures are frequent causes of chronic back pain with negative consequences regarding immobility, quality of life, morbidity, mortality, and fracture incidence. The best currently available evidence-based treatment reduces vertebral fracture risk but does not totally prevent follow-up fractures. Kyphoplasty is a causal treatment of pain by internal stabilization that prevents the ongoing pain of constant vertebral (micro-)fracture. The indication for this minimally invasive procedure requires interdisciplinary discussion of the individual case to guarantee technical feasibility, increase the likelihood that kyphoplasty will indeed reduce pain, and embed this procedure in the individual patient's long-term therapeutic concept or treatment of painful vertebral metastases. In addition to internal stabilization of painful vertebral fractures, kyphoplasty seeks to restore lost vertebral height, which appears promising in acute and painful vertebral fractures. Available controlled prospective studies demonstrate long-term patient benefits in terms of pain reduction, mobility, and improved quality of life.
