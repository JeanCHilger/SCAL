Aneurysmal bone cyst at C2: imaging evaluation after intralesional injection of calcitonin and methylprednisolone. To demonstrate imaging findings during the follow-up of patients with aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) of C2 treated with intralesional injection of calcitonin and methylprednisolone.Three patients with ABC of C2 were treated percutaneously with intralesional injection of calcitonin and methylprednisolone. All the patients were females, with ages varying from 6 to 13 years. All of them presented with cervical masses, but without neurological symptoms.Imaging follow-up with CT and plain films showed progressive ossification and reduction of the blood-filled cavities with volume reduction of all lesions. No recurrence was noted during the follow-up.Intralesional injection of calcitonin and methylprednisolone is a safe treatment option for cervical ABC. The CT scan is especially valuable as a guide of injection site and for the follow-up of ossification of the treated ABCs.
