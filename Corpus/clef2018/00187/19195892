Anterior C1-2 osteochondroma presenting with dysphagia and sleep apnea. Spinal osteochondromas are rare, benign tumors of the bone. These tumors can manifest as solitary lesions or as part of a hereditary syndrome. Most spinal osteochondromas occur in the posterior cervical spine and can cause myelopathy or radiculopathy. Osteochondromas of the anterior cervical spine that cause respiratory or swallowing symptoms are rare. We present the unique case of a solitary osteochondroma of the anterior C1 vertebral arch causing obstructive sleep apnea and dysphagia in a 16-year-old female. The patient underwent resection of the tumor via a left anterior transcervical approach to the spine. The patient's symptoms resolved completely after surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a sporadic osteochondroma arising from the anterior arch of the C1 vertebra causing dysphagia and obstructive apnea in a pediatric patient.
