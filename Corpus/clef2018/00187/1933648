Computed tomography of congenital spondylolisthesis of the sixth cervical vertebra. Congenital anomalies of the cervical spine occur relatively commonly. An interesting anomaly is congenital spondylolisthesis of the sixth cervical vertebra. We are presenting a case of this anomaly as imaged with plain radiography and computed tomography. We have also reviewed the previous literature and attempted to clarify distinctions between bilateral cervical spondylolysis with spondylolisthesis and other cervical spine lesions.
