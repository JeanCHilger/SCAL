Shoulder pain and functional disability in spinal cord injury patients. Sixty spinal cord injured patients were examined to determine the incidence of nontraumatic shoulder pain and associated functional disability during the first 18 months after spinal cord injury (SCI). Seventy-eight percent of quadriplegics and 35% of paraplegics had pain in the first six months. When reexamined six to 18 months after SCI, 33% of the quadriplegics and 35% of the paraplegics continued to have pain. The functional disability resulting from shoulder pain was not a significant problem for the paraplegics however, 84% of the quadriplegics having pain had either moderate or severe functional disability during the first six months after SCI, and this impairment persisted in patients with shoulder spasticity at follow-up evaluation between six and 18 months postinjury.
