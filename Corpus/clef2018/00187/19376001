Fracture of the odontoid process in children: a case report. The authors report a case of apophysial fracture of the odontoid process in association with paresis of the upper extremities in a 5-year-old child. The fracture was treated by gradual guided self-reduction without anaesthesia, followed by a Minerva jacket cast immobilisation. Reduction was anatomical, and the neurological problems regressed within 48 hours.
