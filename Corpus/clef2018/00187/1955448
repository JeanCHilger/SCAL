Unilateral facet dislocations and fracture-dislocations of the cervical spine. We treated 36 patients with unilateral facet dislocations or fracture-dislocations of the cervical spine at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1986. Adequate records were available for 34: ten patients were treated by open reduction and posterior fusion, and 24 by nonoperative management. Of these, 19 had halo traction followed by halo-thoracic immobilisation, four had a simple cervicothoracic orthosis, and one received no active treatment. Anatomical reduction was achieved more frequently in the operative group (60% compared with 25%). Nonoperative treatment was more likely to result in cervical translation on flexion/extension lateral radiographs, and in significant symptoms. Only 36% of the patients treated by halo traction achieved anatomical alignment in 25% halo traction failed to achieve or maintain any degree of reduction. During halo-thoracic immobilisation, half of the patients lost some degree of reduction and patient satisfaction with the appliance was low. Open reduction and internal fixation of unilateral facet injuries gave better results. 6
