Complete traumatic laryngotracheal disruption--a case report and review. Blunt neck trauma is an infrequent cause of injury in the pediatric population however, significant injury is possible even with minor trauma to the neck. The authors present the previously unreported case of a combined laryngotracheal and esophageal disruption as well as a severe laryngeal crush injury in a pediatric patient following a blunt, clothesline neck injury. Immediate management of laryngotracheal or esophageal separation is frequently discussed, but little information exists concerning long-term treatment and management of total laryngotracheal disruption and crush injuries in pediatric patients. A review of the literature is presented to address these concerns.
