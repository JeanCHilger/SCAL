Thoracic intervertebral disc herniation. Twelve men and 8 women, aged 15-73 years, were operated upon for herniated thoracic intervertebral disc during the years 1946 to 1972. The average duration of the symptoms was 14-15 months (range 4 days to 5 years). The most common symptom was back pain, with disturbances of sensibility or loss of power in one or both legs. On admission 13 patients had paraparesis. Laminectomy was carried out in all cases, and in two patients costotransversectomy was also performed. In six cases there was a transient exacerbation of the paraparesis after operation. 17 patients were followed up 2-25 years after operation. 13 had no neurological symptoms or signs, and two had slight loss of power in the legs. Of two patients who had paraparalysis before operation, one still suffered from paraparalysis, while the other had a moderately severe paraparesis.
