Migration of rod through skull, into brain following C1-C2 instrumental fusion for os odontoideum: a case report. Case report and brief literature review.To describe a unique complication following C1/2 fusion in a pediatric patient.Os odontoideum, if symptomatic or unstable, should be treated by internal fixation. Posterior instrumented fusion of the cervical spine is not an uncommon surgical procedure.Direct observation and management of the patient during representation with postoperative complication.This case report details the previously unrecorded and unusual migration of a fixation device through the skull into the brain and outlines its subsequent removal.Failure of bony fusion can result in micromotion and subsequent migration of fixation device components. This can occur even if the screw fixation is apparently sound. Extended routine radiographic follow-up would identify migration earlier.
