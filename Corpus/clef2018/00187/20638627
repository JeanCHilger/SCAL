Incidence of symptomatic vertebral fractures in women of childbearing age newly treated with high-dose glucocorticoid. The treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis have been controversial in premenopausal women during their childbearing years.This study assessed the incidence and risk factors for symptomatic vertebral fracture in women of childbearing age newly treated with high-dose GC.An observational cohort study was conducted at the rheumatic center of Shimoshizu National Hospital in Chiba, Japan, from 1986 to 2006. The prevalence of symptomatic vertebral fractures, as determined by x-rays, was assessed in premenopausal (aged <50 years) women with collagen vascular disease newly treated with high-dose GC (> or =20 mg/d prednisolone equivalent) compared with their counterparts who did not receive GC. Differences in the incidences of vertebral fractures were compared between groups by the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated by the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.A total of 373 women were assessed: 292 patients in the high-dose GC treatment group (mean [SD] initial age, 32.4 [8.2] years initial dose, 43.8 [14.9] mg/dIn this study, high-dose GC use was associated with a significantly high prevalence of symptomatic vertebral fractures in premenopausal women with collagen vascular disease during their childbearing years. However, the fracture risk was relatively low in women of childbearing age, especially those in their twenties and thirties during the early years of treatment.
