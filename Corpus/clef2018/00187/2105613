Age-related changes in the cervical facet joints: studies with cryomicrotomy, MR, and CT. The cervical facet joints of 20 cadavers were studied systematically with MR, CT, cryomicrotomy, and histologic sections to determine the anatomic changes that occur with age. Uniform layers of cartilage and subarticular cortical bone characterize the cervical facet joints in cadavers under 20 years of age. Most adult cervical facet joints have only a discolored or microscopically thin layer of cartilage and have irregularly thickened subarticular cortical bone. The appearance of the cervical facet joints changes significantly with aging.
