A study to narrow down the time when a hyoid bone fracture was sustained. An unstable hyoid bone that can be loosely moved during autopsy is initial reason to suspect trauma to the neck. The question to be answered is whether the increased mobility is due to incomplete ossification of the hyoid, a postmortem injury (damage), or an ante-mortem injury, possibly related to the cause of death. This is the first study to systematically assess whether stereomicroscopic examinations and flat-panel CT-scans of isolated, unstable hyoid bones can add information to the macroscopic examination by helping to determine when the instability arose. Sixteen isolated hyoid bones (8 female, 8 male 4-87 years-old) were examined after being macerated. Four of the hyoid bones were already classified as unstable during autopsy. Of the other 12, 7 were fractured immediately after autopsy before being macerated, and 5 were fractured after being macerated. There were, in total, six different diagnostic constellations. Stereo-microscopic examination did not yield additional information compared with the macroscopic examination. Flat-panel CT allowed distinction between an incomplete ossification of the hyoid and a fracture, but did not help in determining whether the fracture had been sustained peri- or postmortem.
