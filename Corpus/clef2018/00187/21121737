Transpharyngeal bone grafting for a dens delayed union in a toddler. The authors report a case of dens fracture and complete quadriplegia in a 14-month-old child. Three months after reduction with a halo vest, there was no evidence of callus formation, so transoral transpharyngeal bone grafting and Minerva immobilization was performed, resulting in prompt healing without complications after 2 months, and a full neurological recovery and normal cervical spine motion at the 4-year follow-up.
