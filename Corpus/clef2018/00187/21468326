Cervico-thoracic kyphosis in a girl with Pierre Robin sequence. Congenital cervico-thoracic kyphosis has been encountered in a girl with Pierre Robin sequence. The constellation of the spine malformation complex such as incomplete development of the vertebral bodies associated with defective ossification of the cervico-thoracic pedicles causing effectively the development of complete spinal cord injury at the kyphotic level of C7/T1 were present. Congenital kyphosis secondary to vertebral body hypoplasia has not been reported in connection with Pierre Robin sequence.
