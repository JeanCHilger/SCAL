Multiple vertebral compression fractures associated with post partum osteoporosis. This report is to present the results of treatment of women suffering from postpartum osteoporosis and eight-level thoracolumbar compression fractures, and how they improved through clinical manifestation and bone mineral density (BMD).Radiological evaluation revealed eight-level compression fractures over the thoracolumbar vertebrae of the 31-year-old women that were suffering with back pains and radiating pains for 4 months after child-birth. Bone mineral densitometry showed significantly decreased lumbar T score, while other laboratory findings related to calcium metabolism were within normal range. The treatments administered on the women include risedronate and calcium with vitamin D, transforaminal epidural injection and rehabilitation treatment such as physical therapy and exercise.BMD improved and the back and radiating pains were significantly reduced after one year of treatment.Conservative management including medication, epidural injection, and a rehabilitation program was effective in treating patients with post partum osteoporosis and associated multiple compression fractures.
