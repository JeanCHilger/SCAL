Myxopapillary ependymoma: correlation of clinical and imaging features with surgical resectability in a series with long-term follow-up. Retrospective case series.The objective of this study is to identify imaging and intraoperative characteristics that may predict surgical resection for myxopapillary ependymoma (MPE). The diffuse involvement in the conus-filum region makes complete resection challenging. The preoperative characteristics that may estimate the extent of resection has not been reported.Toronto, Canada.All MPE cases between 1972 and 2005 at a single institution were identified and reexamined by a neuropathologist. Neurological outcomes (Frankel scale), clinical features, operative findings, pre and postoperative imaging results were reviewed.A total of 18 operations were performed on 15 MPE patients (8 females/7 males age range: 18-71 years). Median postoperative follow-up was 56 months. Three patients (17%) developed tumor regrowth requiring reoperations. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRIOur series is the first to correlate MPE involvement to conus medullaris on preoperative MRI with intraoperative findings, and examine its significance on surgical resectability. This information could guide clinicians in preoperative planning and advising patients on treatment options and potential risks/benefits. MRI is very sensitive (100%) and moderately specific (67%) in detecting direct anatomical contact between conus and MPE tumors.
