Delay in operative stabilization of spine fractures in multitrauma patients without neurologic injuries: effects on outcomes. Optimal timing for surgical stabilization of the fractured spine is controversial. Early stabilization facilitates mobilization and theoretically reduces associated complications.We identified consecutive patients without neurologic injury requiring stabilization surgery for a spinal fracture at an academic tertiary-care hospital over a 12-year period. Incidences of postoperative complications were prospectively evaluated. We analyzed results based on the time elapsed before the final surgical stabilization procedure. Multivariate analyses were performed to explore the effects of potential confounders.A total of 83 patients (60 men, 23 women mean age 39.4 yr) met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 27.1 (range 12.0-57.0)This study demonstrates a strong relation between timing of surgical stabilization of spinal fractures in multitrauma patients without neurologic injuries and complications. Further studies with larger samples may allow for better adjustment of potentially confounding factors and identify subgroups in which this effect is most pronounced.
