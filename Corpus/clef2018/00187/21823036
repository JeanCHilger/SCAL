Modified technique for C1-2 screw-rod fixation and fusion using autogenous bicortical iliac crest graft. Various techniques have been described for posterior atlantoaxial fusion. Sublaminar passage of the wire/cable is cumbersome with a risk of spinal cord injury. Packing morselized bone grafts into the C1-2 facet joints may be difficult and it may cause massive bleeding and neuropathic pain or posterior scalp numbness postoperatively. We introduce a modified method by using C1-2 screw-rod fixation (SRF) to compress a structural iliac bone graft between the posterior elements of C1 and C2 without supplemental wiring construct.From December 2006 to May 2009, 35 consecutive patients with atlantoaxial instability treated by this method were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical and radiographic history was recorded. Patients with neck pain had relieved significantly after surgery and the neurologic status was also improved greatly. Thirty-three (94.3%) patients gained bony fusion at 3Â months postoperatively. No vertebral artery and spinal cord injuries were noted. There was no instrumentation failure during the observation period.We conclude that the C1-2 SRF with construct-compression structural bone grafting can be used for C1-2 fusion with relatively simple performance and less time-consuming in selected cases.
