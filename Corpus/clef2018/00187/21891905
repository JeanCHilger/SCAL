Evaluation of skeletal maturation by comparing the hand wrist radiograph and cervical vertebrae as seen in lateral cephalogram. Aim of this study was to determine the validity of cervical vertebrae radiographic assessment to predict skeletal maturation.Left-hand wrist and lateral cephalometric radiographs of 100 Bangalore children aged 8-18 years, divided into 10 groups of 10 subjects each with equal distribution of males and females, were measured. On left-hand wrist radiograph, the classification of Fishman was used to assess skeletal maturation. Cervical vertebrae maturation was evaluated with lateral cephalometric radiograph, using the stages developed by Hassel and Farman. The changes in hand wrist and cervical vertebrae were correlated.Significant association was observed between skeletal maturation indicator stages and cervical vertebrae maturation indicator stages. Correlation coefficient was found to be significant (P<0.0001).The results of the study indicated that the cervical vertebrae maturation and hand wrist skeletal maturation was significantly related.
