Acute symptomatic intervertebral disk calcification in a child with retropharyngeal edema: computed tomography and magnetic resonance findings. Intervertebral disk calcification in children is an uncommon self-limiting disease, which can cause symptoms like neck pain or torticollis, and can be treated with conservative management. The calcified disk material can herniate anteriorly, inducing dysphagia, or herniate posteriorly, causing neurologic symptoms secondary to spinal cord compression. We report computed tomography and magnetic resonance findings of a symptomatic intervertebral disk calcification at the C2-3 level with retropharyngeal edema caused by anterior herniation of calcified material in a 7-year-old boy.
