Ganglioglioma of the thoracolumbar spinal cord in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1: a case report and literature review. Gangliogliomas of the spinal cord are rare, and the conus medullaris is an extremely rare site for their occurrence. The authors present a case in which a ganglioglioma was found in the thoracolumbar spinal cord, including the conus medullaris, of a 5-year-old female patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who presented with paraparesis and urinary disturbance. MRI revealed an intramedullary lesion within the thoracolumbar spinal cord, including the conus medullaris, which was surgically removed. Pathological investigation showed a ganglioglioma consisting of glioneuronal tumor cells. This is the first report to provide a pathological description of a spinal cord ganglioglioma in a patient with NF1. Because gangliogliomas usually have a good prognosis following resection, it is important to clearly distinguish them from other NF1-associated lesions, even though ganglioglioma of the thoracolumbar spinal cord, including the conus medullaris, is an extremely rare condition.
