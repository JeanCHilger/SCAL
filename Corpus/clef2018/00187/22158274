Lumbar vertebral fractures in children: four cases and review of the literature. Vertebral fractures and severe injuries to the spine cord in children are rare and account for a small proportion of all childhood injuries. Pediatric vertebral and spinal cord injuries have unique characteristics depending on their age. Young children sustain upper cervical spine injuries, which are more serious injuries and have a higher mortality rate. Older children have lower spine injuries and thoracoabdominal injuries.This study aimed to present the epidemiology and potential complications from lumbar spine fractures.There were 4 cases of older children who sustained lumbar vertebral fractures.Fractures of the lumbar spine in children, although relatively rare, are important to understand. Patterns of injury with vertebral and spinal cord injuries in children vary from those of adults. The biologic differences of children make differences in fracture patterns and alter the management necessary for successful treatment. Errors in management can have adverse effects on these injuries.
