Upper extremity wheelchair kinematics in children with spinal cord injury. Current methods for the evaluation of upper extremity dynamics during wheelchair mobility in children are limited. The goal of this study was to characterize upper extremity joint kinematics during wheelchair mobility. A 3-D biomechanical model of the upper extremities is presented for kinematic assessment of manual wheelchair propulsion in children with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). The bilateral upper extremity model consists of the thorax, upper arms, forearms, and hands. The model was applied to thirteen (13) children with SCI. Joint angles and joint ranges of motion of the shoulders, elbows, and wrists were quantified. Peak joint motions during the stroke cycle were compared between right and left sides for further insight to mobility patterns. This work will provide insight to be used in future kinetic studies of wheelchair mobility.
