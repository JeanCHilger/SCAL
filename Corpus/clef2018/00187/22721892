Intra-operative cone-beam CT (O-arm) and stereotactic navigation in acute spinal trauma surgery. The purpose of this ambispective cohort study is to describe the emerging role of intra-operative cone-beam CT (O-arm®, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), frequently coupled with stereotactic navigation (StealthStation®, Medtronic), in the surgical management of acute spinal trauma. All patients with acute spinal trauma between May 2009 and May 2011 who were treated with the use of the O-arm were identified from a prospectively collected spine database and retrospectively analyzed to characterize indications and outcomes. Over the two-year period, the O-arm was used in 183 spinal operations 27 of these (15%) involved acute spinal trauma. Within the trauma cohort, 14 injuries were in the cervical spine, nine at the cervicothoracic junction, and four were in the thoracolumbar spine. In 12 patients (44%) pre-existing aberrant and challenging anatomy, commonly ankylosing conditions, were present. Surgical techniques included transarticular atlantoaxial fixation and direct osteosynthesis of a Hangman's fracture performed entirely percutaneously (via two stab incisions) using O-arm assisted stereotactic navigation. No trauma cases using O-arm assisted navigation had iatrogenic neurovascular injury and none required subsequent revision surgery for implant malposition, compared with a revision rate of 1.2% of patients with non-navigated acute spinal trauma during the same interval. Technical factors associated with successful application of this technology in the setting of acute spinal trauma were detailed. O-arm assisted navigation can overcome anatomical challenges and broaden the available stabilization options in the management of acute spinal trauma. Other advantages include protecting the surgical team from cumulative fluoroscopic radiation exposure and patients from repeat surgery due to implant malposition.
