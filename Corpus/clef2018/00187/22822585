Pediatric odontoid fracture causing Brown-Sequard syndrome: a case report. An odontoid fracture leading to Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS) is an uncommon condition with only seven cases reported to date. To our knowledge, there are no reports of occurrence in paediatric patients. We report a paediatric odontoid fracture leading to Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS) with satisfactory recovery following surgical treatment. Odontoid fractures may lead to Brown-Sequard syndrome in cases of high-energy trauma in paediatric patients. Direct anterior screw fixation may be a treatment of choice in paediatric odontoid fractures of the comminuted, displaced type when occurring in conjunction with neurologic injuries.
