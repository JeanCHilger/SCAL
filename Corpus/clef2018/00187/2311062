Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression. Results of treatment and survival. All medical records of patients treated for metastatic compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina in the eastern part of Denmark from 1979 through 1985 were reviewed. With regard to treatment response and survival, 345 patients could be evaluated. Carcinoma of the lung (19%), prostate (18%), breast (13%), and kidney (10%) were the most frequent primary malignancies causing spinal compression. The outcome of treatment depended primarily on the patients' condition at the time of diagnosis: 79% of the patients who were able to walk before the treatment remained ambulatory, whereas only 21% of the nonambulatory paraplegic patients and 6% of the paralytic patients regained walking ability. Patients treated with laminectomy followed by radiotherapy seemed to respond better than patients treated with radiotherapy or laminectomy alone, but when the patients' pretreatment motor function was taken into account no significant difference was found between the three forms of treatment. In the subgroup of nonambulatory patients, however, a significantly better restoration of gait was observed in patients treated with the combination of laminectomy and radiotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy alone. A longer survival in the group treated with the combination of laminectomy and radiotherapy may reflect that these patients were in a lower stage of disease and thus had a better potential of regaining motor function. The results call for prospective randomized studies.
