Intraspinal, extradural hemorrhage in a 7-year-old boy with hemophilia B. A 7-year-old boy with severe hemophilia B suffered an intraspinal extradural hemorrhage without preceding trauma. Since the age of 3 years the patient is HIV-1 positive. The actual hemorrhage caused a strong pain in the thoracolumbar area without signs of spinal cord compression. It was diagnosed by CT-scan. By early high dose factor-IX substitution the hemorrhage was stopped and no neurological complications occurred. The further substitution regime is described.
