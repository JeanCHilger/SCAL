A pilot study on changes in passive range of motion in the cervical spine, for children aged 0-5 years. The aim of this study was to investigate the values for passive range of motion (PROM) in rotation and lateral flexion of the neck, for children aged 3.5-5 years, and to compare the results with the measurements carried out on the same group of children as infants.Twenty-three children (10 females) were assessed in PROM in rotation and lateral flexion of the neck. Both measurements were performed with the children in a lying position using a large protractor. The dependent t-test was used to compare PROM with the PROM from an earlier study when the children were infants.PROM of the neck was found to be a mean 100° in rotation and 70° in lateral flexion at the age of 3.5-5 years. There was a significant decrease in rotation when comparing the measurements with values from infancy.These data suggest that there is a decrease in PROM in rotation during the first 5 years of life, and that PROM in lateral flexion remains unchanged.
