Evaluation of vertebral stability after cervical injuries. This study is the proposal of a possible algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of unstable cervical spine injuries. It also describes the results of implementation of different mechanisms of injury with the formation of specific posttraumatic conditions it indicates in which direction to move on. Thereby, it is of particular importance to recognize stable and unstable entity of cervical spine with a recommendation for a specific access to any of them.
