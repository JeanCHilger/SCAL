Analysis of changing paradigms of management in 179 patients with spinal tuberculosis over a 12-year period and proposal of a new management algorithm. To describe management and outcome in a large cohort of patients with spinal tuberculosis (TB).Of 212 patients with spinal TB treated between January 1999 and June 2011, 179 patients were included in the study (≥6 months follow-up mean age, 34.8 yearsThe study cohort comprised 93 male patients. Mean age was 34.8 years ± 7.2 (range, 10-75 years). Mean duration of symptoms was 2.4 months. Sensorimotor deficits were present in 167 patients (93.5% 74 patients were paraplegic), pain was present in 156 patients (87%), bladder involvement was present in 127 patients (71.7%), and extraspinal TB was present in 36 patients (22.3%). Of patients, 92% were receiving prior chemotherapyMedical treatment of spinal TB is the mainstay however, radical, instrumented surgeries should be offered when indicated. The presence of paraplegia should not preclude surgery. A practical management paradigm is also suggested.
