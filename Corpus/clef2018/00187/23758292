Assessing the state of chronic spinal cord injury using diffusion tensor imaging. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of the cervical spinal cord and neurological disability in patients with chronic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). A cervical spinal cord 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with DTI sequences was performed on 28 patients with chronic traumatic SCI and 40 healthy control subjects. DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), were calculated within the normal-appearing spinal cord area at levels C2 or C3. Clinical assessment of the patients was performed according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) and the motor subscale of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The FA values of the patients with SCI were significantly lower than those of healthy control subjects (p<0.000001). In contrast, the ADC and RD values of these patients were significantly higher than those of control subjects (ADC p<0.0001, RD p<0.00001). In patients with SCI, the FA values were positively correlated with the motor (pr=0.56, p<0.01) and sensory (pr=0.66, p<0.001) scores of ISNCSCI and with the motor subscale of FIM (pr=0.51, p<0.01). DTI revealed spinal cord pathology, which was undetectable using conventional MRI. DTI changes in regions that were remote from the site of primary injury were most likely the result of secondary degeneration of white matter tracts. Decreased FA values were correlated with poorer motor and sensory function, as well as a lack of independence in daily living. DTI is a promising quantitative and objective tool that may be used in the clinical assessment of patients with SCI.
