Carotid artery trauma: management based on mechanism of injury. Fifty-six patients with carotid injuries were reviewed (35 penetrating and 21 blunt). Shock correlated with a profound neurologic deficit on admission (p less than 0.03) in those with penetrating wounds. Thirty-one percent had primary repair, 25% had interposition grafting, 17% were ligated, and 17% were anticoagulated. Two graft failures resulted in death. Three blunt common carotid injuries followed direct cervical soft-tissue trauma 18 internal carotid (ICA) dissections followed apparent extreme neck extension or flexion. Seven had bilateral ICA dissections (39%)
