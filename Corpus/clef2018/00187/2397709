Sudden onset of velopharyngeal insufficiency in Klippel-Feil syndrome. A 17-year-old girl with Klippel-Feil vertebral anomalies presented with sudden onset of VPI and hoarseness after a minor neck torsion injury. Her symptoms were felt to be due to compression of the brain stem by the odontoid process (through basilar invagination). The VPI and hoarseness responded to conservative management with oral steroids.
