Spinal injuries in children and adolescents. Pediatric cervical spine injuries are rare. Knowledge of possible types of injury, physiological development and anomalies is necessary in order to not overlook the injury and to initiate suitable therapy. Description of the clinical assessment, Management of diagnostics and therapy of specific injuries. Based on a selective literature search and taking into consideration our own experience, typical injuries at the upper and lower cervical spine in pediatric patients are depicted. In the presence of neurological deficits, identification of the cause is crucial. Odontoid fractures and injuries to the second cervical vertebra are common in upper cervical spine injuries, compression fractures and facet joint dislocation injuries are common in lower cervical spine injuries. Depending on the location of the injury and on the grade of instability, specific therapy, including conservative treatment (orthosis, halo fixation) and operative treatment (internal fixation, fusion) might be necessary.
