Paediatric acquired pathological vertebral collapse. Vertebral collapse is a significant event in the paediatric patient with a real potential for associated deformity and morbidity. While in adults the causes tend towards the malignant, particularly metastatic and metabolic disease, the paediatric population demonstrates a different range of diagnoses. This article reviews the typical imaging findings of the more common underlying acquired pathological causes of vertebral collapse in children, including Langerhans cell histiocytosis, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, osteogenesis imperfecta. Other causes include pyogenic osteomyelitis and tuberculosis and neoplastic lesions, either primary, metastatic or of haematological origin.
