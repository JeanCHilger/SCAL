Magnetic resonance imaging of posttraumatic spinal ligament injury. We evaluated the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of ligament injury in 37 patients after acute traumatic spinal injury. Thirty-five patients had fractures, one had neurologic deficit with normal x-rays, and one had evidence of cervical instability on flexion/extension plain films. MRI examinations were performed acutely (average 10.8 d after injury) using T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar imaging. Two radiologists blindly evaluated all MRI examinations. Subsequently, 35 plain films, 16 tomograms, and 30 computed tomography (CT) scans were also evaluated. Nineteen patients were considered to have torn posterior ligaments on the basis of their clinical, radiographic and surgical findings. MRI detected ligament damage in 17. All patients considered to have intact posterior ligament complexes clinically and radiographically had no evidence of ligament damage on MRI. T2-weighted sequences were essential for detection of ligament injury. We conclude that MRI is an accurate method for assessment of the integrity of spinal ligaments after acute trauma.
