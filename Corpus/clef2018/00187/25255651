A case of blunt common carotid artery injury following minor trauma. Cervical major blood vessel injuries often produce acute ingravescence of the circulatory dynamics. Therefore, if immediate treatment is not given, fatal complications can occur, resulting in death. Common carotid artery (CCA) injuries in particular are often associated with fatal outcomes. Moreover, most CCA injuries with hemorrhage producing hematoma are the result penetrating trauma, and there are few reports of blunt injuries. We report herein on a case of blunt CCA injury producing acute hematoma due to minor trauma. A 35-year-old man who was gently punched on his jaw when he was training with his child visited emergency room in our hospital complaining of swelling and pain of his neck soon after that. When we examined his neck, the larynx was displaced to the left by right neck swelling. Flexible transnasal laryngoscopic examination revealed constriction of the suffocating airway by a hematoma, so an emergency tracheotomy was performed. Enhanced CT of the neck showed active bleeding, so emergency surgical removal of the hematoma and hemostasis was carried out. We found a laceration (approximately 2 cm) of the CCA, and arrested hemorrhage with sutures. No postoperative neurologic deficit occurred. His postoperative course was good, and discharged 22 days after the operation.
