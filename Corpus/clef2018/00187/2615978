Cervical vertebral and spinal cord injury in intensive therapy. 24 of 184 patients with vertebro-medullary trauma admitted to the Neurosurgery Clinic of Milan University in the years 1976-1988 have been examined. A common feature of these was a myelic lesion (transverse, complete or incomplete) at cervical level in which respiratory problems had made a period of intensive care indispensable. The purpose of the research was to assess the reliability of certain parameters in establishing patient prognosis. The following parameters were compared: clinical, objective and instrumental examination for a strictly neurological evaluation and for an evaluation of general condition, quantification of the same clinical examination through two scales, the Sunnybrook Cord Injury Scale (SCIS) for the neurological factor and the APACHE II for general condition, the type of treatment, with the same basic medical-resuscitation treatment. The result of the surgery or non-surgery was considered a posteriori. It is concluded that, in the case of the patients considered (high myelic lesion) the prognosis must be split into two different moments that the patient goes through in succession: the acute phase and the stabilisation phase. In the first phase, in which the vital functions are involved, the SCIS and APACHE II scales (with their sum) have great prognostic value in the second phase, certain values, already considered on the APACHE II scale, are comparable in all patients and the prognostic problem is based on the other scale (SCIS) and on the adjuvant neurophysiological techniques. The very distinction between the two different phases that the patient traverses appears important also for the purposes of surgical indication.2
