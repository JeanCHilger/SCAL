Compressive vertebral hemangioma. The contribution of imaging technics to diagnosis and pretherapeutic evaluation. From a serie of ten cases of compressive vertebral hemangiomas (H.V.C.), the interest of different imaging methods was evaluated. CT scan and M.R.I. were the best imaging modalities in most cases. A CT guided biopsy was necessary in three cases to differentiate from metastasis. Angiography permitted to establish the vascular patterns and to evaluate the usefulness of embolization performed in six cases.
