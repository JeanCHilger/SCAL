Diaphragmatic pacing by electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve--a case report. A four-year-old boy had traffic accident and was transferred to our hospital with cardiorespiratory arrest, on March 24, 1986. After resuscitation, quadriplegia and apnea were sustained. Computed tomography (CT) scan on the day of admission only demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage and plain roentgenograms of the skull and cervical spine showed no abnormalities. He opened his eyes to verbal order one week later, but apnea and quadriplegia sustained. CT scan obtained on that day demonstrated no abnormalities but roentgenogram of the cervical spine showed atlanto-axial dislocation. On May 26, 1986, he was treated with densectomy through transoral approach. Furthermore, on June 19, he underwent laminectomy of the atlas, partial craniectomy of the occipital bone, and posterior fusion with iliac bone graft. However, apnea continued, and bilateral diaphragmatic pacemaker (Avery Laboratory Inc.) was planed: On Sept. 18, platinum and silicone rubber electrodes were surgically implanted on the both phrenic nerves at the cervical portion. Each electrode was connected by lead wire and connector to a radio-frequency receiver which was implanted in a subcutaneous abdominal pocket. An external transmitter supplied electrical power and information of the stimulation to the implanted receiver by radiofrequency across the skin. Pacing time was gradually prolonged and continuous pacing for four hours could be successfully gained by March, 1987. Pneumonia once occurred in the course of gradual prolongation of the pacing time. The ideal candidates for diaphragmatic pacing are patients with normal phrenic nerves, diaphragm, and lungs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
