Spondylodesis of the cervical spine using a metal-polymer construction. The method of spondylodesis of the cervical spine by a metal-polymer design was used in operations on 54 patients with cerebrospinal trauma. The control group was formed of 15 patients in whom spondylodesis was performed by an autograft. Double fixation of the vertebral bodies by a metal design and protacryl ensures reliable stabilization and supporting function of the damaged spinal segment, requires no skeletal traction or additional external immobilization in the postoperative period, allows conduction of early rehabilitation therapy with activation of the patient himself, and is conducive to reduction of the terms of the restorative period of treatment.
