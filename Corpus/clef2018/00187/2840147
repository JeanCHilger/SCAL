A preliminary review of the use of Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation for spinal injuries. Twenty-seven patients with unstable spinal injuries underwent posterior reduction and internal fixation with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. Anterior decompression and fusion was performed as well when the injury was a burst fracture. Neurologic status was assessed at the time of injury and one year later, using both the Frankel classification as well as the Motor Index Score. The study suggests that good fracture reduction, secure internal fixation with CD instrumentation, and satisfactory decompression of neural elements provide a favorable environment to maintain three-dimensional stability and to facilitate neurologic recovery.
