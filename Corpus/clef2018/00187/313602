Clinical and radiological aspects of maxillo-nasal dysostosis: "naso-maxillo-vertebral syndrome". A study of 34 new cases (author's transl). Maxillo-nasal dysostosis is not uncommon as we have noted 34 new cases in eight years. The most characteristic anomalies, well described by Binder, are nasal hypoplasia both of bone and cartilage with agenesis of the nasal spine, as well as a characteristic rearrangement of the naso-labial muscles. On first seeing the patient the disease is generally recognized by the very typical aspect of the nose. There very often exists however other dental, mandibular and cervical spine anomolies. It is indispensable to look for these anomalies in the work up of patients with this malformation syndrome "the naso-maxillo-vertebral syndrome", in order to better understand the disease and better treat the patients.
