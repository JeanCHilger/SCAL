Physical ability in relation to anthropometric measurements in persons with complete spinal cord lesion below the sixth cervical segment. A study was undertaken to determine the ability of patients with complete tetraplegia below cervical sixth segment to transfer in relation to their anthropometric characteristics. Thirty-six chronic patients were assessed and spasticity was measured. A discriminant function analysis was carried out to assess the extent to which a number of anthropometric and anatomical variables could predict the patients' final ability to effect a transfer. Using nine of the original 23 predictor variables it is possible to correctly classify a patient's eventual ability to transfer in 92% of cases.
