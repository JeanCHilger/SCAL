Magnetic resonance imaging in amateur boxers. Nine amateur boxers who participated in the 1985 and 1986 New York City Golden Gloves competition underwent detailed neurologic examinations and magnetic resonance (MR) scanning. All nine boxers were medically suspended secondary to a knockout or excessive head blows. Neurologic examination results and MR scans were normal in all nine boxers. Failure to detect abnormalities on the MR scan, by neurologic examination, or both in these amateur boxers may reflect several factors, including a small sample size, the duration between their last bout and neurologic evaluation, and the lower exposure to head trauma among amateur boxers compared with professionals.
