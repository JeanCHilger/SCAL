Traumatic epidural hematoma of the cervical spine: diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging. Case report. A traumatic epidural hematoma of the cervical spine is reported in a 13-year-old girl. The patient recovered spontaneously over several days without surgical intervention. The diagnosis was made on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which also demonstrated subsequent resolution of the hematoma. The etiological factors of spinal epidural hematomas are reviewed and the utility of MR imaging in differentiating other causes of acute spinal cord injury is emphasized.
