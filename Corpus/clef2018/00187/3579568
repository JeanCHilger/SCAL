Mandatory vs selective exploration for penetrating neck trauma. A prospective assessment. To determine the optimal management of patients with penetrating wounds to zone II of the neck, we performed a prospective evaluation of 120 consecutive patients with such injuries, correlating the results of clinical and diagnostic examinations with operative findings. Seven patients presenting with life-threatening hemorrhage from the neck wound were operated on immediately the remaining 113 patients underwent arteriography, laryngotracheoscopy, esophagoscopy, and esophagography, followed by neck exploration. Forty-eight major injuries were identified in 35 neck explorations. Five patients were identified with clinical and diagnostic findings that were considered normal preoperatively
