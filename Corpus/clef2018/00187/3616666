Thoracic fractures and dislocations in motorcyclists. Motorcyclists who are involved in accidents generally suffer severe multiple injuries, some of which are not readily apparent on initial examination. One such subtle injury is fracture, with or without dislocation, in the upper thoracic spine. The severe spinal cord damage produced by the injury is often overshadowed by cerebral or cervical injury. Proper diagnosis is further hampered by the fact that the upper thoracic region is difficult to examine radiographically on plain films, particularly when using portable equipment. Of a group of 14 motorcyclists having 26 fractures and/or dislocations in the thoracic region, 12 had 24 injuries between T3 and T8. These 24 injuries represented 56% of the fractures and/or dislocations encountered in a larger study of trauma to the thoracic vertebral column. All of these were flexion injuries, suffered when the individual was thrown from the motorcycle and struck a large, solid object. In three cases, the diagnosis was delayed as much as 48 h because proper films were not obtained initially. Because of the serious consequences of delayed treatment, we recommend that all motorcyclists who have sustained severe trauma be examined by overpenetrated film of the upper thoracic region.
