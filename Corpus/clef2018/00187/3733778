Bilateral fracture of the pedicle of the second cervical vertebra in the young child. We report the cases of five children, six to eighteen months old, who had bilateral fracture of the pedicles of the second cervical vertebra. The children were treated with gentle cervical traction in mild extension or were maintained in near-anatomical reduction in a Minerva jacket or halo cast. The fractures united in four patients. One patient underwent fusion to stabilize the spine.
