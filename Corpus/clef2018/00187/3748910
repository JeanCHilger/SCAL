Osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine. Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor of bone that occurs in children and adolescents, particularly in the femur and tibia. Osteoid osteoma of the spine accounts for approximately 10% of these lesions. There frequently is a delay in diagnosis because of its difficult visual appearance. Pain in the spine occurring at night that is relieved by aspirin, or painful scoliosis, should alert the physician to the possibility of its presence. Bone scan and tomograms are essential in making the diagnosis. Complete surgical excision of the lesion is the procedure of choice for immediate, lasting pain relief.
