Brain abscess complicating the use of a halo orthosis. We report a case of brain abscess complicating the use of a halo orthosis in the treatment of a cervical spine injury suffered during wrestling. Four previous brain abscesses complicating the use of halo orthoses have been reported. All cases of abscess have been associated with overlying infection at the site of pin insertion. Our case and at least one of those previously reported may have been related to tightening of the halo pins after placement. Serious spine injuries occur rarely in wrestlers and are associated with the use of illegal holds and maneuvers in which one athlete is thrown to the mat. The pathophysiology and radiographic appearance of a unilateral facet dislocation are reviewed.
