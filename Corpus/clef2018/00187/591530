Spinal injury at the level of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae from football. Acute traumatic lesions of the spine at the third and fourth cervical levels without associated fracture are not common. The eight lesions in this report occurred as a result of injuries sustained during tackle football. They included acute intervertebral disc herniation, anterior subluxation of the third cervical vertebra on the fourth, unilateral dislocation of the joint between the articular processes, and bilateral dislocation of the joints between the articular processes. The mechanism of injury was the use of the top or crown of the helmet as the primary point of contact in a high-impact collision when blocking, tackling, or head-butting. To avoid a seemingly inevitable increase in the incidence of these lesions occurring from tackle football, coaches and officials will have to modify the current techniques of blocking tackling, and head-butting.
