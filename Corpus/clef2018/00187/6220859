Radiographic examination of the lumbosacral spine: an 'age-stratified' study. Of a total of 99 922 radiological requests, 3.3% were for examinations of the lumbosacral spine. An 'age-stratified' study of 657 females aged 15-44 years referred for lumbosacral examination was carried out. 17.3% were referred because of trauma, with a total fracture incidence of 4.1% as compared with 9.5% in the other age-sex groups. Analysis of the other reasons for referral and the radiological diagnoses showed that 80% of all referrals were for more or less non-specific reasons, summarised as lower-back pain an equal percentage of the radiological diagnoses indicated that there was either no lesion or a lesion which did not influence management.
