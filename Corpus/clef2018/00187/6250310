Local anomalies and secondary degenerative-dystrophic damage in the craniovertebral region. Clinical and x-ray studies of patients with focal anomalies of the osteoarticular apparatus of the craniovertebral area demonstrated that half of the cases showed early complications in the form of secondary degenerative-dystrophic lesions. This process is aggravated proportionally to the degree of pronounced interrelation disturbances and overstrain in the craniovertebral area. The secondary degenerative-dystrophic lesions indicate disordered compensation and significantly aggravate the clinical state and working capacity of the patients.
