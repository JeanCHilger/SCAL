Computed tomography in orthopedic radiology. CT offers specific advantages in the evaluation of complex spine trauma and pelvic injuries, particularly to evaluate fractures of the acetabulum. Spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation are conclusively demonstrated by CT and lumbar myelography thus becomes superfluous. Femoral and tibial torsion may be estimated with high accuracy by CT. CT is of definite value in the evaluation of bone neoplasms, and chronic inflammatory diseases of the spine and pelvic bones, especially for the determination of the tumor extent and soft-tissue pathology.
