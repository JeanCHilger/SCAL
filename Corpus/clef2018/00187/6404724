Contribution of computed tomography to the radiological clarification of a chondroma of the cervicothoracic spinal column. On the basis of a chondroma which, as is well known, is very rarely found in the cervicothoracic spinal canal, the contribution made by computed tomography to the radiological identification of such benign tumours in explained. Morphology, localisation and incidence of chondromas and their differentiation against other tumours localised in the vertebral column, are discussed. The possibilities offered by the available diagnostic tools are compared with each other, also with regard to indication of operation and surgical planning.
