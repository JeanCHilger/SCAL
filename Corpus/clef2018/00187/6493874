Trampoline-related quadriplegia: review of the literature and reflections on the American Academy of Pediatrics' position statement. A review of the world's literature documenting cervical spine injuries has been made in an attempt to determine common factors regarding patient characteristics, environment, injury mechanisms, and pathology. The policy statements and safety guidelines of both the American Academy of Pediatrics and athletic administrative bodies have been reviewed in order to evaluate what effect, if any, these policies and guidelines have had on documented injuries. On the basis of this review, it is believed that the AAP was ill-advised in altering its position on the use of trampolines. The opinion is presented that both the trampoline and minitrampoline are dangerous devices when used in the best of circumstances, and their use has no place in recreational, educational, or competitive gymnastics.
