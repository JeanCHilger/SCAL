Evaluation of Pott's disease with computed tomography. The CT appearance of eight cases of culture-positive spinal tuberculosis is reviewed. Three patients had single level vertebral involvement, while five others showed multilevel involvement. In seven of eight cases, paraspinal soft tissue involvement was seen. In two, the process caused neurologic symptoms by extending into the epidural space. In three patients the paraspinal extension was not only local, but spread along multiple levels. The CT appearance can be highly suggestive of TB in cases where the diagnosis has not been suspected. In cases where the diagnosis is suspected by plain films, CT can display unsuspected extension of the disease and be helpful in needle localization for aspiration.
