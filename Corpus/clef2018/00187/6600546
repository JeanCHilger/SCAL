Renal positional changes in spinal-cord-injured patients. Spinal-cord injured patients can have urinary tract changes related to their conditions. Altered renal position and vertical axis have not previously been identified. The urograms of 55 paralyzed patients were reviewed and compared with normal controls. Statistically significant differences (p less than 0.001) were noted in the position of the kidneys with respect to the renal angle and distance of the lower poles to the midline. No significant difference was noted between patients who were paraplegic vs. those who were quadriplegic. The more medial and vertical positioning of the kidneys was believed to be due to the psoas muscle atrophy in the spinal-cord-injured patients.
