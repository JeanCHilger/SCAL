Pseudosubluxation of the cervical spine in adolescents: a case report. Anterior displacement of the second cervical vertebral body over that of the third in the adolescent occurs because of the hypermobility of these segments. This pseudosubluxation may be confused with true subluxation or dislocation of the cervical spine in a youthful patient. Failure to recognize this normal variation may lead to unnecessary treatment.
