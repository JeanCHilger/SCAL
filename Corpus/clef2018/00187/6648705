The crush-cleavage fracture. A "new" thoracolumbar unstable fracture. Among 14 patients with unstable thoracolumbar fractures examined by both conventional radiography and CT, we found seven patients with a "new" common fracture pattern. This fracture pattern consisted of (1) superior disc injury, (2) crush fracture of the upper half of the vertebral body, (3) sagittal fracture (cleavage fracture) of the lower half of the vertebral body, (4) bone fragments in the spinal canal, and (5) laminar fracture. Five of the seven patients had sustained their injuries in vertical falls all five had primary neurological deficit symptoms. We consider this fracture to be unstable.
