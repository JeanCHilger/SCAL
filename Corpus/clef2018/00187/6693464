Tuberculosis of the lower cervical spine (C2 to C7). A report on 40 cases. Forty patients with tuberculosis of the lower cervical spine (second to seventh cervical vertebrae) have been reviewed. Pain and stiffness were important and dominant symptoms. Two types of disease were recognised. In children under 10 years old involvement was extensive and diffuse with the formation of large abscesses. In patients over 10 the disease was localised and produced less pus, but was associated with a much higher incidence of Pott's paraplegia. The overall incidence of cord compression was 42.5 per cent (17 out of 40) 13 of the 16 patients with the "adult" type of disease had this complication. The commonest method of treatment was with antituberculous drugs, anterior excision of diseased bone and grafting. This regime rapidly relieved pain, compressive respiratory symptoms due to abscesses and Pott's paraplegia. It also corrected kyphotic deformities from an average of 25.5 degrees to 5.4 degrees.
