Operation or observation for penetrating neck wounds? A retrospective analysis. A review of 83 patients with penetrating neck wounds was performed to assess the relative merits of operation versus observation. Fifty patients (60 percent) underwent immediate surgery, 28 of whom (56 percent) had no significant neck injury. There were no deaths and only two complications (4 percent). Thirty-three patients (40 percent) were treated with initial observation, one of whom required subsequent surgery. In the latter group, there were also no deaths and two complications (6 percent). Length of hospital stay did not differ between patients with negative findings on exploration and those observed. When clinical signs as indications for surgery were present, management was more often correct than when signs were absent (82 and 52 percent, respectively), but the presence or absence of signs correctly predicted injury or lack of injury in over 80 percent of the patients. These data demonstrate the safety and efficacy of selective observation of patients with penetrating neck trauma, and confirm that clinical signs are a reliable indicator of significant injury.
