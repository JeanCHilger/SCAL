Giant cell tumor of the cervicothoracic spine. Four cases of giant cell tumor of the cervicothoracic spine are reported. All involved women aged 17-20. Current treatment consists of surgical extirpation and radiation therapy however, carefully monitored cryotherapy of this lesion may be a feasible new therapeutic method. Due to their relatively inaccessible location, giant cell tumors of the spine will be difficult to treat adequately, and can be expected to recur and cause neurologic compromise in a significant proportion of cases. Computed tomography is the imaging method of choice for defining the extent of tumor because it can show bone involvement, spinal canal encroachment, and soft-tissue extension.
