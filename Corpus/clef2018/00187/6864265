Spinal metastases with neurological manifestations. Review of 600 cases. The authors have studied 600 cases of spinal metastasis causing a neurological syndrome. The most significant statistical data are reviewed. The cases are examined according to clinical characteristics, type of primary tumor, site of lesion, and survival. Each of these factors influenced the choice and results of treatment. As a general rule, combined treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) was used. Preliminary surgery was performed as an emergency, designed to halt progression of the neurological syndrome and to prevent its more serious manifestations. The technique and usefulness of surgery are discussed for different situations and the short-term results of treatment are related to the various factors involved.
