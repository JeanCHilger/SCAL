Value of anterior arthrodesis in the treatment of fractures of the pedicles of the axis (author's transl). Many authors consider that satisfactory consolidation of fractures of the pedicles of the axis can be regularly obtained by conservative procedures. These lesions appear to be benign as far as their neurological complications are concerned, and yet a review of the world literature shows that 30 p. cent are treated surgically. In the limited number of cases where operation is justified, anterior arthrodesis through the sternomastoid with fixation by a plate appears to be less dangerous and more reliable than applying screws to the pedicles. Excellent functional results can be expected. Posterior arthrodesis appears to be less reliable, and gives poor functional results, and should be reserved for cases in which there is a combined fracture of both the odontoid and the pedicles. Anterior arthrodesis appears to be a logical choice, requiring no special surgical skills, as confirmed by the review of 257 cases reported in the published literature.
