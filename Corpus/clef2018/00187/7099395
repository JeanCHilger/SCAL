Hemangiopericytomas of the spine. Four cases of hemangiopericytoma of the spine are reported. These are rare tumors that arise from the pericytes. Due to their invasive nature and marked vascularity, and detailed radiological work-up including computed tomography and spinal angiography should be obtained before a direct surgical attack is performed. Embolization of the tumor may also be quite helpful before surgical excision and has allowed a gross total removal of the tumor in two of the cases.
