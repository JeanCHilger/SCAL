Osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine: case reports and literature review. Osteoid osteoma, a benign osteoid-forming tumour, may be found in any bone in the body. Approximately 10% of cases involve the most common site and the cervical region the second commonest site for spinal osteoid osteomas. Two new cases of cervical spine osteoid osteoma are presented and the 21 previously reported cases are reviewed. This cervical spine tumour should be considered as a possible diagnosis in any young person complaining of neck or upper back pain, especially if the pain is worse at night, is relieved by salicylates and is accompanied by tenderness, neck stiffness and scoliosis of rapid onset. Detailed radiologic investigation aids in the diagnosis and accurately locates the lesion. Surgery is the definitive treatment and complete resection of the tumour results in rapid and permanent relief of pain.
