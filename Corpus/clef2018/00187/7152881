Diagnosis and treatment of cervical instability. Instability of the cervical spine gives rise to vertebral and neurological symptoms which may be progressive. The principal causes of instability are: trauma, sequelae of laminectomy, malformations, vertebral infections, rheumatoid arthritis, primary tumours (benign and malignant), metastases, and chronic degenerative disease of the discs. Each of these forms of instability must be identified and, depending on the symptoms and pathogenesis, is capable of responding to the appropriate treatment.
