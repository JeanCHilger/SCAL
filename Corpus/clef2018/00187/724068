Diagnosis of abnormal spine motion with cineradiography (author's transl). For the past one year, 13 patients were studied 20 times with cineradiography to diagnose abnormal spine motion, which was quite informative compared to usual plain spine X-ray pictures. The direct radiation dosis was only 2.35 rem/min on taking cineradiography at the speed of 60 frames/sec. The camera used was Cardoskop-U and the X-ray generator was Pandoros Optimatic, both of which were of Siemens make. It was keenly recognized that cineradiography was useful to diagnose 1) solidity of spine fusion, 2) effect of spinal traction, 3) efficacy of immobilizing apparatus for spine and 4) abnormal spine motion on dynamic way.
