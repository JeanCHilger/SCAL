Double or multiple level fractures of the spine. Over a period of 5 years, 231 patients with nonpathological fractures of the spine were admitted to the Orthopaedic Department of Athens University. Eighteen (7.79 per cent) were found to have double or multiple level fractures of the spine which means that these injuries are not so uncommon. We define double level fracture as those which are separated by an intact spinal unit, not related at least at one end to a fractured vertebra. These fractures, if overlooked, may cause serious complications.
