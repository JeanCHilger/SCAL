Interhemispheric acute subdural hematoma: a computed tomographic manifestation of child abuse by shaking. Parieto-occipital interhemispheric acute subdural hematomas (IASH) were found in 17 (61%) of 28 abused children examined by computed tomography, presenting with neurologic symptoms. CT demonstration of IASH correlated with injury due to severe shaking, the presence of retinal hemorrhages, and the absence of the stigmata of battering. Subsequent computed tomographic examination in these patients demonstrated infarction in 50%, and cerebral atrophy in 100%.
