Anterior stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures using the Kaneda device: a preliminary report. Anterior decompression and fusion is a valuable technique in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Anterior instrumentation has evolved to correct deformity and stabilize the spinal segments during decompression and bone grafting as a single-stage procedure. One anterior device developed by Kaneda has been used in our institution since 1989. This study is an initial review of our experience with this instrumentation. Anterior decompression and fusion augmented with the Kaneda device was performed in 20 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. Timing of surgery was early (< 15 days) in 13 patients, intermediate (16 to 120 days) in 2, and delayed (> 121 days) in 5. Sixteen patients were neurologically intact (Eismont grade D), 3 with distal weakness (Eismont grade B or C) and 1 with complete paraplegia (Eismont grade A). All patients with deficits recovered one Eismont grade after anterior decompression and fusion. Complications included pulmonary problems in 2 patients, a thoracic duct laceration requiring ligation, and a sympathectomy effect of the lower extremity. One patient had a pulmonary embolus and developed a hematoma at the graft harvest site while on anticoagulants with resultant meralgia paresthetica. There have been three screw failures and one definite pseudarthrosis. Anterior decompression and fusion supplemented by the Kaneda device was performed on 20 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. The average correction of kyphosis was approximately 50% acutely, with loss of approximately 50% of correction at follow up. In some patients, coronal plane deformity was created by the device. No effect on neurologic recovery could be shown with this small series. Perioperative complication rate was 30%, and 1 patient developed pseudarthrosis.
