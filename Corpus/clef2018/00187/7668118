Magnetic resonance imaging in spinal emergency. We studied the diagnostic value of MRI in spinal emergency. One hundred patients were analyzed retrospectively and the MR-findings were compared with operative results or autopsy whenever available. The advantages of MRI compared to CT and conventional myelography are discussed. The limitations of MRI are addressed and the important features of appropriate diagnostic procedure are outlined with special attention to neurosurgical requirements.
