Conservative management of posttraumatic cervical intersegmental hypermobility and anterior subluxation. To discuss the case of a young male football player who sustained a hyperflexion cervical injury, including radiographic evidence of intersegmental hypermobility and translational displacement with cervical hypolordosis and anterior subluxation.The patient suffered from neck pain, spasm, limited range of motion and mild sclerogenous referred arm pain. The results of neurological exams were normal. Radiographs of the cervical spine revealed cervical hypolordosis, intersegmental hypermobility and anterior subluxation. MRI was normal, with no evidence of disk herniation.The patient was immobilized for the first 10 days with a cervical collar and was administered adjunctive physiotherapy. Light cervical manipulative techniques were added in the subacute stage, as were isometric and tubing exercises. The patient responded quickly and favorably to care. Subsequent radiographs revealed a reversal and resolution of the abnormal findings of the cervical hypolordosis, anterior subluxation and intersegmental hypermobility that were initially seen.Conservative chiropractic management of hyperflexion injuries may be useful in reducing clinical symptoms, cervical hypolordosis, anterior subluxation and intersegmental hypermobility, as seen in follow-up radiographs. Chiropractic sports physicians have the diagnostic and therapeutic expertise to manage these types of athletic injuries.
