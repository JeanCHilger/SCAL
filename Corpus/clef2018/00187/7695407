Noniatrogenic esophageal trauma. Few guidelines are available with which to facilitate treatment in patients with noniatrogenic injuries of the esophagus. Early diagnosis and proper management are essential if a good outcome is to be expected. In an effort to define better the treatment of patients with penetrating and blunt injuries of the esophagus, we report our recent 5-year experience at an urban trauma center. From July 1988 to June 1993, nineteen patients with esophageal perforations from penetrating (18) and blunt (1) trauma were identified by our trauma registry. There was no mortality in this group of patients and morbidity was mostly due to associated injuries. Eleven cervical esophageal injuries were repaired. One cervical injury was treated by stopping oral intake and giving intravenous antibiotics. The neck was not drained in 10 of the surgical cases. In 1 patient a tracheoesophageal fistula developed, which later was repaired with a pectoralis muscle flap. Seven perforations were identified in the thoracic (2) and abdominal (5) portions of the esophagus. All were due to gunshot wounds. In 4 cases, a fundal wrap was used to reinforce the repairs. Postoperative contrast studies confirmed that all repairs were intact. We conclude that penetrating and blunt tears of the esophagus can be repaired safely with minimal mortality. Morbidity is usually from associated injuries such as to the spinal cord and trachea. When identified early, cervical esophageal injuries do not need to be drained routinely.
