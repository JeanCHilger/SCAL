Tuberculosis of the lower cervical spine (C3-C7) in adults: diagnostic and surgical aspects. From 1976 to 1992, 160 cases of tuberculosis of the spine were treated at Jeanne Ebori Medical Center (Gabon) among whom 10 were localized to the lower cervical spine (C3-C7). From those 10 cases, 5 concerned children and had a medical treatment, whereas the remaining 5 cases concerned adults and underwent surgery (anterior approach), following an initial three-weeks course of antituberculous therapy. Prominent features of the disease in the 5 adult cases included neck pain and stiffness, neurological deficits and osteolytic erosions with myelographic block. The mean length of follow-up was 32 months (range: 8 to 96 months). All five patients improved their cord function and had a satisfactory bony consolidation. Socio-economic difficulties explain the necessity of reducing the treatment length by favoring surgical intervention in relatively advanced lesions.
