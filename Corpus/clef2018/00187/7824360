Gorham's disease or vanishing bone disease: plain film, CT, and MRI findings of two cases. Gorham's disease may develop in any region of the skeleton, but shows a predilection for the bones of the shoulders and pelvic girdles. Less frequently, the disease may involve the spine, and it is the proximity to the spinal cord which may worsen the patient's outcome. We report the clinical outcomes of two children with typical, yet differently localized involvement, and also review the plain film, CT and MRI findings.
