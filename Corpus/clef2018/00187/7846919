Results of mandatory exploration for penetrating neck trauma. Management of penetrating wounds to the neck remains controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature. We assessed 393 consecutive stab wounds penetrating the platysma operated at our trauma service between January 14, 1991 and September 30, 1992 to evaluate our policy of mandatory neck exploration (NE). Injury to the common (n = 19 cases), external (n = 7), internal carotid (n = 5), innominate (n = 2), subclavian (n = 20), vertebral (n = 12), facial (n = 2), and intercostal (n = 2) arteries the external (n = 36), internal (n = 65), subclavian (n = 20), and innominate (n = 4) veins
