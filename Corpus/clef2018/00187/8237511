Disappearance of syringomyelia following resection of extramedullary lesion. A contribution to the aetiological enigma of syringomyelia. A case of platybasia associated with syringomyelia is presented where the syrinx regressed nearly completely after transoral resection of the dens. This course seems to be of considerable interest because it is hardly explainable by the common theories which try to elucidate the pathogenesis of syringomyelic cysts.
