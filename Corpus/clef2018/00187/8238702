Spear tackler's spine. An entity precluding participation in tackle football and collision activities that expose the cervical spine to axial energy inputs. We describe spear tackler's spine, a clinical entity that constitutes an absolute contraindication to participation in tackle football and other collision activities that expose the cervical spine to axial energy inputs. A subset of football players were identified who demonstrated: 1) developmental narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical canal 2) persistent straightening or reversal of the normal cervical lordotic curve on erect lateral roentgenograms obtained in the neutral position
