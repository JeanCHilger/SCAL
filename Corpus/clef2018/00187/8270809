Ventilator-assisted youth: appraisal and nursing care. An interdisciplinary review of 16 ventilator-assisted, cervical-cord injured youth, aged 3-19 years, was completed to explore long-term outcomes and develop recommendations for care. Ten youths were younger than 12 years 6 were adolescents. The mean initial hospital length of stay was 192 days. Discharged youths were followed for 1-73 months after hospitalization. Nursing implications were developed using a systems approach with North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) approved diagnoses. Nursing case management was used to coordinate discharge planning and continuity of care. At the time of data collection 13 youths had been successfully reintegrated to home, school and community, the least restrictive environments for all.
