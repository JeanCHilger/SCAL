Fractures of C1 and C2 in an infant gazelle: a model of the human fracture pattern. Spontaneously occurring fractures of the anterior and posterior synchondroses of C1 and the superior facet of C2 of an immature mammal were analyzed. The posterior C1 injury showed comminution, with involvement of both sides of the synchondrosis. Just below the anterior C1 fracture was an incomplete, comminuted fracture of the C2 superior facet. These fractures, especially the C1 injury, appear similar to the radiographic injury patterns in skeletally immature humans. Presumably the histologic failure patterns in the child would also be similar.
