Acute injuries of the upper dorsal spine. In an effort to define better diagnostic and treatment criteria, we reviewed the cases of 50 patients with injuries of the upper dorsal spine from T2-T9, seen between January 1983 and July 1988. The majority of injuries were caused by road traffic accidents, followed by falls from a height, and train accidents. More than 50 per cent had associated injuries, of which four were missed 50 per cent had neurological deficits, and the majority of these cases had burst fractures and fracture-dislocations. Treatment was non-operative in the majority of cases, with only four cases undergoing anterior spinal decompression and fusion, and one had posterior instrumentation and fusion. At follow-up (1-3 years), only one patient, a child, had significant deformity. All patients with partial neurological deficit improved, whereas none of those with complete neurological lesions recovered. Five patients had significant back pain requiring analgesics but not significant enough to interfere with their activities. We concluded that most of these injuries are stable and should be treated non-operatively. Surgery is only indicated in cases with partial neurological deficit and significant spinal canal compromise or significant instability. Children should be followed up until maturity to look for late deformity.
