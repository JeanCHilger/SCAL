Dose-related effect of moxisylyte on maximal urethral closing pressure in patients with spinal cord injuries. The effects of single intravenous doses of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mg/kg moxisylyte on maximum urethral closure pressure were evaluated in a placebo-controlled double-blind experiment in 20 patients with spinal cord injuries. Pharmacodynamic testing was performed until 30 minutes, and blood pressure was assessed until 60 minutes. Our findings showed a dose-dependent decrease in maximum urethral closure pressure. At each individual time point, the three doses differed significantly from placebo. Ten minutes after dose administration the maximum effect (48% decrease) was obtained with 0.75 mg/kg. A significant difference in favor of the highest dose was shown from 15 to 20 minutes after administration. According to these findings and because 0.75 mg/kg was as well tolerated as the two other doses, such a drop in pressure indicates that the alpha-blocking agent moxisylyte may be an effective means of decreasing urethral resistance, with obvious implications for the management of urinary obstruction.
