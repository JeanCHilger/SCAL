Bilateral musculocutaneous nerve palsy. A case report. A case of bilateral, isolated, proximal musculocutaneous nerve palsy is reported. Initial physical and electromyographic examinations demonstrated complete denervation of the biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis muscles bilaterally. Nerve conduction studies of the musculocutaneous nerves initially revealed no evoked potentials. The patient underwent resection with end-to-end anastomosis on the left and neurolysis without resection on the right. Significant functional recovery was noted bilaterally but was more rapid and complete on the side that underwent neurolysis without resection.
