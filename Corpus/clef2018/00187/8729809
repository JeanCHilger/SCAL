Cervical spondylolysis in children. Apropos of 4 cases. Review of the literature. A clinical and radiological study of four cases of spondylolysis in children. Literature review shows the congenital origin of the disorder and how it is to be treated.We report on four children with cervical spondylolysis. One of the children presented a two-level spondylolysis C5C6. One case was totally asymptomatic and was hazardly discovered. Standard radiographs were used for diagnosis. Conservative treatment was administered in all cases and all patients were immobilized for a few days.It has been clearly established that cervical spondylolysis is a congenital disorder often associated with other anomalies: spina bifida, dysplasia of the posterior articular processes. In the child, cervical spondylolysis is only discovered in fifty per cent of Post traumatic cases. The most frequent finding is at C6. A diagnosis can be made based on the radiographs and the CT scan. MRI will only be indicated in spondylolisthesis in order to analyze the disc statement and the degree of canal narrowing. When possible conservative treatment should be adopted. Arthrodesis is reserved for unstable and painful lesions.Cervical spondylolysis in the child is a rare congenital disorder. It must be distinguished from the congenital absence of a pedicle and from a pedicle or isthmic fracture. It is a lesion which is normally discovered once the patient has turned adult and is very well long term tolerated.
