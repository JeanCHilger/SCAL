Asymptomatic cervical haemangioma treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. We report a 17-year-old asymptomatic patient with a partially collapsed seventh cervical vertebra due to a haemangioma revealed by conventional radiographs performed for army enrollment. Given radiological evidence of aggressiveness, percutaneous vertebroplasty by injection of methyl methacrylate cement was performed to prevent complications. CT a year later showed no progression of the lesion. The patient remains asymptomatic.
