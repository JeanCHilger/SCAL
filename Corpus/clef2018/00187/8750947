Imaging of childhood torticollis due to atlanto-axial rotatory fixation. Atlanto-axial rotatory fixation is a rare cause of childhood torticollis. It may occur spontaneously or may be associated with trauma, upper respiratory tract infection or congenital abnormality of the cervical spine. Presentation is usually with persistent torticollis and "cock robin" deformity of the neck. In this paper the radiological experience in three patients is presented. Investigations included plain radiographs, plain anteroposterior tomography, CT and MRI. Displacement of the lateral mass of the atlas and the eccentric position of the odontoid peg can be seen in the plain films. CT scan can exclude fractures and confirm atlanto-axial rotation. The superimposition of CT images is demonstrated as a way of diagnosing subluxation. MRI offers better soft tissue differentiation and allows assessment of the integrity of the transverse ligament. This has an important bearing on the prognosis and may influence surgical treatment. It is important to recognise the plain film features of this uncommon condition and confirm the diagnosis with CT or MRI. The treatment options are discussed with particular reference to long term outcome.
