Trauma in the last trimester of pregnancy. Although accidents during pregnancy are fairly rare, besides endangering the mother, they nearly always mean a vital threat to the fetus: lethality rates are up to 8% for the mother and up to 34% for the fetus. Besides depression of the circulatory system in the mother, coupled with fetal hypoxy, injury to the placenta and uterus is also possible. Moreover, the unborn child may be injured by direct trauma. If the fetus sustains a direct injury, the head of the child is affected in the majority of instances. In addition, the risk of an intrauterine death is very high. If the injured baby survives after a section, permanent damage must be taken into account. Pregnant women who are injured in an accident should quickly be checked by sonography and cardiotocography. If no danger is expected for the child, the usual therapeutic rules that apply for traumatology should be followed. If the mother and child are endangered, a cesarean section must be undertaken along with simultaneous accident-related surgery on the mother. Case reports are presented on three cases in our clinic last year, and the current literature is discussed. All three mothers and newborns survived because of the cooperation between surgeons, gynecologists and pediatricians.
