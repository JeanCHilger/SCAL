Thoracoscapular fusion in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy: clinical review of a new surgical method. A new method of scapulothoracic fusion is described for patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. To improve upper limb function by abolishing scapula winging, bilateral procedures were performed in six patients with an average age of 30 years (range 17 to 44 years). The average follow-up was 49 months (range 1 to 7 years). A good functional and cosmetic result was obtained in all patients. An average postoperative increase in shoulder abduction of 28 degrees and flexion of 40 degrees was seen. Only a small diminution in respiratory function occurred (mean decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 14% and forced vital capacity of 21%).
