Orthopedic aspects of child abuse. Fractures are one of the most common manifestations of child abuse. Pediatricians and other physicians caring for children must have a clear understanding of the injury patterns sustained by children in abusive situations and be able to recognize those injuries. A thorough history and physical examination and accurate radiographic interpretation are essential. Early identification of nonaccidental trauma is imperative because proper intervention has been shown to be effective.
