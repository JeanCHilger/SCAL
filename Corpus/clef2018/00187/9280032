Fracture-dislocation at the thoracolumbar junction in an infant with locked vertebrae. A case report. A retrospective, single-patient case report.To report on a 9-month-old infant with fracture-dislocation at the thoracolumbar junction with locking of vertebral bodies, probably with incomplete neurologic injury and partial postoperative recovery.Fracture-dislocation at the thoracolumbar junction is rare in infants, the upper cervical spine being the level usually affected. Incomplete neurologic injury is uncommon after such a severe shear injury.The patient was followed through personal examination and chart review from initial presentation to 6 months after the injury.Open reduction with posterior spinal fusion was followed by partial neurologic recovery and a stable spine over 6-month follow-up.Fracture-dislocation at the thoracolumbar junction is rare in infancy. This is probably due to unique anatomic and biomechanical features of the spine in infancy.
