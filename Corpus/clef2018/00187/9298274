Spinal cord compression by secondary epi- and intradural metastases in childhood. Over a 9-year period, 35 out of 614 children with malignant tumours who were treated at the Centre Léon Bérard developed spinal metastases. Of these, 18 with known malignancies before the development of spinal cord compression are reviewed. The most common tumours causing spinal metastases were Ewing's sarcoma, neuroblastoma and renal tumours. Cord compression occurred 5-88 months after the diagnosis of systemic cancer. The median interval from first symptoms to the diagnosis of compression was 17 days. There were 16 patients with neurological deficit, including 5 with paraplegia. Specific imaging procedures were performed in 16 patients. Treatment included operation in 8 patients, followed by chemotherapy (6 patients) and/or radiotherapy (4 patients) 9 of the 10 non-operated patients received radiotherapy. Only 6 patients had a significant neurological improvement. All patients but 1 died within a median time of 2 months. Early diagnosis might prevent permanent disability in these children with a short survival expectancy.
