Cavernous angiomas of the spinal district: surgical treatment of 11 patients. Cavernous angiomas, also called cavernous malformations or cavernomas, are vascular hamartomas accounting for 3-16% of all angiomatous lesions of the spinal district. Although histologically identical, these vascular anomalies may exhibit different clinical behavior and radiological features, depending on their location, hinting at different managements and therapeutic approaches. The authors report 11 cases of symptomatic spinal cavernous angiomas diagnosed and surgically treated over the past 18 years. Age of patients ranged from 15-75 years males outnumbered females. Three patients had vertebral cavernous malformations, secondarily invading the epidural space
