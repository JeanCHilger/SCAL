Giant intrasacral schwannomas: report of six cases. Only 4 of the 30 previously reported cases of giant sacral schwannomas have been studied with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We are reporting 6 more cases, 5 of which had MRI studies. There were 5 women and 1 man (average age 45 years) with long lasting symptoms consisting of lumbosacral and radicular pain accompanied by urinary disturbances and dysaesthetic sensations in the lower limbs. CT clearly defined sacral bone involvement but poorly demonstrated intraspinal tumour extension which was more evident in MRI studies. MRI also clearly showed the intrapelvic extension of the tumour, its relationship with the neighbouring structures and the dumbbell growth pattern due to tumour extension through sacral foramina which are important data for making a pro-operative diagnosis and surgical planning. Surgical treatment consisted of piecemeal tumour resection through a posterior approach in four cases. Two patients underwent operation through an abdominal transperitoneal approach followed by a sacral laminectomy. Total intracapsular resection was apparently achieved in 5 cases. Through an average follow-up period of 9.2 years and despite a rather conservative approach, the recurrence rate has been very low in our series and only one patient had to be re-operated on for tumour recurrence.
