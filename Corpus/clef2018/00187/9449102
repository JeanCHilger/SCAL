Injuries caused by water tubing. Water tubing (the pulling of an inner tube behind a power boat) is growing in popularity and unfortunately is becoming an increasing source of pediatric trauma. This is related to the lack of control of either the driver or the rider in directing the inner tube away from objects in the water or along the shore. Because of the severe trauma from this increasingly popular sport, we thought it appropriate to review our experience at a major pediatric trauma center to draw attention to this increasing cause of injury in children and to develop guidelines to reduce such injuries. A retrospective review of children admitted over a 10-year period revealed eight children who required admission to hospital for injuries sustained in water tubing. Five patients sustained fractures, one a splenic contusion, and two atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation. A set of safety guidelines for water tubing has been developed in an attempt to minimize the dangers to children who wish to pursue this sport.
