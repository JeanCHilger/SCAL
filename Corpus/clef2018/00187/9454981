Successful conservative management of Gorham disease of the skull base and cervical spine. Gorham's disease, also called massive osteolysis or vanishing bone disease, is an enigmatic condition caused by endothelial proliferation occurring in bone and soft tissue. Death is frequent when there is spinal or visceral involvement. We present a case of spinal and skull base Gorham's disease that was reversed by radiation therapy administered while the spine was supported by a halo vest. The literature is reviewed.
