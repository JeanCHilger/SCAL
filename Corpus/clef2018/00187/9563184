Protrusion of a calcified cervical intervertebral disk in a 5-year-old boy. Herniation of the calcified nucleus pulposus is a complication of intervertebral disc calcification. The herniated nucleus pulposus may assume an intraspinal location which may lead to cord compression and produce alarming neurological symptoms and radiographic images. Surgical intervention is, however, rarely necessary as complete resorption of the calcified disc material will generally occur. We report the case of a five years old boy with the symptoms of an acute tortcollis, radiographs of the cervical spine revealed calcification of C5/C6 intervertebral disc and MRI narrowing of the spinal canal. With conservative treatment his symptoms resolved within three weeks, three months later X-rays and MRI showed complete resolution of the calcification and herniation.
