Efficacy of ultrasound controlled direct reposition of fragments of the posterior vertebral body facet. To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system). Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases. We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55%, postop. 80%) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop. 58%, postop. 78%). 10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occurred. Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52%) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51%) than those without (40% or 39%). There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit. Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated. In case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis: an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded. In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.
