Reference structures for assessment of frontal head posture. The aim of the study was to test (a) the validity of the supra-orbital line as a substitute for the interpupillary line, and (b) the reproducibility of two different approaches of assessing cranio- and cervico-vertical relationships on frontal cephalograms. The material consisted of natural head position frontal cephalograms of 21 healthy Finnish students and 11 Danish young adults prepared according to a method described previously, modified in the Danish sample by addition of spectacles with a wire to indicate the interpupillary line. The cephalograms were analysed manually twice by two investigators with an interval of one week. The following reference lines were selected: (1) orbital line (ORB): a tangent to the extreme cranial point on the supra-orbital margins (2) cranial line (CR): the line drawn through crista galli and anterior nasal spine
