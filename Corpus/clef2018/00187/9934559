The helical three-dimensional CT in the diagnosis of torticollis with occipitocondylar hypoplasia. Congenital anomalies of the atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial joints are rare. Those most commonly reported are atlantoaxial instability, basilar impression, anomalies of the odontoid process, laxity of the transverse atlantal ligament and atlanto-occipital fusion. Occipital condylar hypoplasia is infrequent and difficult to recognise. We recently diagnosed it using helical 3D CT in association with torticollis in two patients. The first patient had a several year history of torticollis. The second patient had acute cervical lymphadenitis associated with post-operative torticollis. 3D CT distinctly revealed atlantoaxial subluxation with hypoplasia of the occipital condyles in both cases.
