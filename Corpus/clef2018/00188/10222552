The morphofunctional characteristics of the duodenum in an osteopenic syndrome in children and adolescents. The study of duodenal morphology in children and adolescents with skeletal deformity.Clinical, hormonal examinations, x-ray investigation of the skeleton with spinal NMR-tomography, gastroduodenoscopy with target biopsy were performed in 41 patients aged 7 to 18 on after treatment for broken spine.Atrophic duodenitis found in most of the patients presented without dyspepsia, with symptoms of duodenitis in 8 patients, osteoporosis in 36% of patients. NMR-tomography rejected compression-broken spine in 22 patients.Disturbed absorption of calcium and atrophic alterations in the duodenal mucosa are thought responsible for disturbance of calcium metabolism and formation of bone tissue.
