Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts located anterior to the cervical spinal cord. Report of two cases and review of the literature. The authors describe two rare occurrences of radiographically, surgically, and pathologically confirmed spinal intradural arachnoid cysts (not associated with additional pathological entities) that were located anterior to the cervical spinal cord. These lesions have been reported previously in only eight patients. The patients described in this report were young adults who presented with progressive spastic tetraparesis shortly after sustaining mild cervical trauma and in whom no neurological deficit or bone fracture was demonstrated. The presence of an intradural arachnoid cyst was detected on postcontrast computerized tomography (CT) myelography and on magnetic resonance imaging both diagnostic tools correctly characterized the cystic nature of the lesion. Plain radiography, plain tomography, and contrast-enhanced CT scans were not diagnostic. In both cases a laminectomy was performed, and the wall of the cyst was excised and fenestrated with subarachnoid space. Postoperatively, the patients made complete neurological recoveries. Based on a review of the literature, arachnoid cysts of the spinal canal may be classified as either extra- or intradural. Intradural arachnoid cysts usually arise posterior to the spinal cord in the thoracic spine region
