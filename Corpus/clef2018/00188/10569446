Employment after spinal cord injury: an analysis of cases from the Model Spinal Cord Injury Systems. To describe the relationship of multiple biographic, injury-related, and educational factors with employment outcomes after spinal cord injury (SCI).Cross-sectional.Data were collected through 18 model SCI systems, a nationwide network of hospitals that treat approximately 14% of all SCIs in the United States.A total of 3,756 persons with traumatic SCI who completed the Form II data collection during their annual follow-up at years 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 years (the most recent Form II was accepted).The Model Systems Forms I and II were used to identify biographic, injury-related status, employment at injury, and productivity status upon follow-up (Form I is used to elicit basic demographic and discharge information, whereas Form II is used to track multiple outcomes during annual follow-ups). The Craig Handicap Assessment Reporting Technique (CHART) was used to assess hours spent in gainful employment and other productive activities.CHART data revealed only a modestly higher Employment rate (24.8%) than that of the traditional single Form II item (22%). Being Caucasian, younger at injury, having lived more years with SCI, having a less severe injury, and having more years of education were all predictive of being employed. Violence at injury was associated with lower employment rates (only 12.9% employed), especially among Caucasians (only 24% employed). Being employed at injury was associated with a greater probability of postinjury employment, but only in the first few years after injury. Among employed participants, women and those who had been injured fewer years averaged fewer hours spent at work.Findings were consistent with those in previous studies. Interventions to improve employability should focus on education and the needs of individuals from minority backgrounds.
