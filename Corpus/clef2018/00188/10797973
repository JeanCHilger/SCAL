Spinal cord injuries in Senegal: 16 cases. Penetrating spinal cord injuries (P.S.C.I.) are rarely described in Sub Saharian countries in spite of an increasing number of wars. To study epidemiology management and prognosis of P.S.C.I. in Senegal, population of 16 patients collected from Fann Hospital in Dakar has been studied. 9 cases were related on gunshot or shrapnel injuries and 6 were stab-wounded. 8 came from war practice and 7 from civilian practice. The point of entry was at the posterior or lateral part of the body and continuous leaking of cerebral spinal fluid from this point was founded only in one patient. Patients showed a clinical picture of a complete spinal cord section syndrome, 3 spinal cord hemisection Brown Sequard syndromes, 3 cauda equina syndromes and 1 monoradicular syndrome. Spinal X-rays or myelography may lead to an accurate evaluation of the extent of bone tissue destruction. Anatomical evaluation of roots and spinal cord lesions were more difficult when C.T. scan or R.M.I. is not available. Penetrating spinal cord injury with foreign body included or myelography stop or showing cauda equina syndrome should be operated on. 9 of our patients has benefited of spine surgical posterior approach (laminectomy). Immediate vital prognosis is good regarding the fact that visceral associated lesions were rare (2 cases). Functional recovery is fair only 46.6% of patients expressed partial or complete recovery. Prognosis factors such as injuring agent and initial neurological status has been discussed. Prognosis of penetrating spinal cord injuries could be improved by immediate and multidisciplinary management.
