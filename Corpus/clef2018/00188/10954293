MR line-scan diffusion imaging of the spinal cord in children. Diffusion imaging has been widely used in the brain, but its application in the spinal cord has been limited. Using line-scan diffusion imaging (LSDI), a technique that is less sensitive to magnetic susceptibility and motion artifacts than are other diffusion techniques, we have successfully imaged the spinal cord in children. The apparent diffusion coefficient and relative diffusion anisotropy of the normal spinal cord were measured. LSDI was compared with echo-planar diffusion imaging of the spine in three patients.
