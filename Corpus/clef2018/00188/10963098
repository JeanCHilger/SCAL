Abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials indicate compressive cervical myelopathy in mucopolysaccharidoses. Compressive myelopathy at the cranio-cervical junction is a complication of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). To detect cervical myelopathy we recorded median and posterior tibial nerve SEPs in 15 patients aged 2.4-33.4 years (median 8.8 years) with MPS I-S (n = 3), MPS IVA (n = 8) and MPS VI (n = 4). In addition to the cortical waveforms we recorded the subcortical median nerve SEPs N13b and P13 generated near the cranio-cervical junction and the lemniscal P30 after posterior tibial nerve stimulation. MRI studies in 13 subjects revealed spinal cord compression at the cranio-cervical junction in 10 patients 5 patients had an increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted initial MRI indicating high cervical myelomalacia and 4 patients had clinical signs of cervical myelopathy. We did not find a relationship between the SEPs and spinal cord compression. Abnormal SEPs were found in the patients with MRI evidence of myelomalacia (sensitivity 1.0, specificity 1.0) and correspondingly in the patients with clinical signs (sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.91). The SEPs consequently deteriorated in 2 subjects of 7.3 and 10.3 years of age. Abnormal SEPs indicated subclinical cervical myelopathy in 3 subjects. Cervical cord compression may be present before occurrence of clinical or electrophysiological evidence of myelopathy. However, we feel that the SEP analysis is useful to detect functional impairment of the cervical cord in patients with MPS.
