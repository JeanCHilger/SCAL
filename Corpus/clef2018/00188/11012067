Eosinophilic granuloma of the spine: early spontaneous disappearance of tumor detected on magnetic resonance imaging. Case report. Two cases of eosinophilic granuloma (EG) of the spine associated with neurological deficits are presented. The patients were treated conservatively by using external fixation with a brace as well as bed rest. Neurological deficits and pain diminished and finally disappeared as the tumor mass decreased in size, as seen on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. During the 5-year follow-up period no recurrence of the tumors was detected on MR images. Surgical treatment for spinal EG in children presenting with typical vertebra plana is not recommended except for those with severe or progressive palsy and for those in whom the disease requires differential diagnosis.
