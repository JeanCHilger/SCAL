Is suprapubic cystostomy an optimal urinary management in high quadriplegics?. A comparative study of suprapubic cystostomy and clean intermittent catheterization. Long-term outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients was compared between those managed by suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) and clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) with particular emphasis on an incidence of urinary tract complications and patients perception for urinary management.The study comprised 61 SCI patients 34 patients managed with SPC (group A), while 27 with CIC (group B). After stabilization of their condition, all were followed annually on an outpatient basis with clinical history, urinalysis, urinary imaging and renal function studies. Mean follow-up periods were 8.6 and 9.9 years for groups A and B, respectively. Between groups, a comparative study was performed on the incidence of urinary complications such as renal dysfunction, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux, symptomatic genitourinary infection and urinary stone. Satisfaction with urinary management was also estimated using the questionnaires during follow-up.Renal dysfunction, hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux were not found in either group. Symptomatic genitourinary infection was seen in 4 (12%) of group A and 7 (26%) of group B, respectively. The incidence of renal stone was 3 (9%) in group A and 1 (4%) in group B. A significant difference was not found between two groups in these urinary complications. On the contrary, bladder stone was seen more frequently in group A (65%) than in group B (30%) with a significant difference (p<0.001). The degrees of incontinence, bother score of daily activities, and overall satisfaction showed no significant difference between the two groups.Except for bladder stones, SPC is a valuable option of urinary management for quadriplegic patients, the results of which were comparable to paraplegic SCI patients managed with CIC.
