Cervical spine abnormalities in neurofibromatosis. Fifty-six patients with neurofibromatosis were examined for abnormalities of the cervical spine and seventeen of them had demonstrated lesions there. Of the thirty-four patients who had scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis, fifteen (44 per cent) had cervical lesions. Many of the patients with those lesions were asymptomatic. To avoid the complications attributable to the cervical spine, we recommend roentgenographic examination in all neurofibromatosis patients who are about to have general anesthesia or skull traction for treatment of scoliosis.
