Traumatic invagination of the fourth and fifth cervical laminae with acute hemiparesis. We describe a patient with traumatic right-sided invagination of two consecutive laminae into the spinal canal. The injury resembled a greenstick fracture and resulted in an acute Brown-Sequard syndrome. There was also an undisplaced hangman's fracture of the axis vertebra. These injuries were caused by an acute hyperextension and axial compression of the cervical spine. Open reduction and internal fixation of the laminar fractures without fusion was followed by full neurological recovery within six weeks.
