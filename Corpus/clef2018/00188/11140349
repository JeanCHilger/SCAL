Confidence of graduating family practice residents in their management of musculoskeletal conditions. A study was undertaken to determine the confidence of graduating family practice residents in the management of musculoskeletal conditions and to determine the level of exposure of graduating family practice residents to fracture care. A 2-page questionnaire consisting of 50 items was sent to 680 graduating family practice residents at 100 randomly selected residency training programs throughout the United States. Family practice residents were questioned about their fracture care experience, including the number of fractures diagnosed, the number of fractures reduced, the number of fractures treated to healing, and the number of casts and splints applied. Residents were also asked about their training experience on an orthopedic surgery service. Residents were asked to rate their confidence on a scale of 1 (least confident) to 10 (most confident) in the physical examination, radiographic evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including physical examination of the knee, lower back, ankle, wrist, cervical spine, shoulder, hand, and foot radiographic evaluation of the lumbosacral spine, traumatic cervical spine, hand injuries, adult shoulder trauma, osteomyelitis, and pediatric elbow injuries
