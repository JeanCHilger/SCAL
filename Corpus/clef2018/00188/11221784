Assessment of intraspinal and intracranial conduction by P30 and P39 tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials in cervical cord, brainstem, and hemispheric lesions. In routine recordings of tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), a global central conduction time is evaluated by measuring the interval between the segmental spinal N22 potential, recorded in the lumbar region, and the cortical P39 potential. In this study, we tested the reliability of the scalp far-field P30 potential, which originates in the vicinity of the cervico-medullary junction, in order to evaluate separately intraspinal and intracranial conduction in normal subjects and patients with cervical cord and intracranial lesions. P30 and cortical P39 potentials were studied in 23 healthy subjects and in 70 patients with cervical cord (n = 47), brainstem (n = 11) or hemispheric lesions (n = 12) selected on the basis of neuroimaging--computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR)--findings. Median nerve SEPs were also recorded in all patients. Of the several montages tested to obtain the P30 potential, the Fpz-Cv6 derivation gave the highest signal-to-noise ratio it permitted to obtain a P30 potential that peaked at 29.2 +/- 1.6 ms in all normal subjects. P30 abnormalities were observed only in patients with cervical or cervico-medullary lesions
