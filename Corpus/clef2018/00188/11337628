The use of traction methods to correct severe cervical deformity in rheumatoid arthritis patients: a report of five cases. A case series is presented.To describe the methods of correction used in this study for flexible severe cervical deformity, and to report the results in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Long-standing rheumatoid arthritis can lead to severe cervical deformity, causing significant functional deficits and poor cosmesis. Information on the use of traction combined with surgical stabilization to achieve correction of flexible deformity in rheumatoid patients is sparse in the English literature.A review of five cases, including pertinent history, physical examination, radiographic evaluation, traction techniques, surgical stabilization, and outcomes, was conducted.Excellent correction of deformity and radiographic union were achieved in all the patients. One patient had minimal loss of correction after surgery and thereafter remained stable. Pin tract infections were the only significant complication.Severe cervical flexible deformity in rheumatoid patients can cause significant disability and can be treated successfully with a combination of traction techniques and surgical stabilization.
