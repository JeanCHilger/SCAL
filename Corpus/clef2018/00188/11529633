Radiologic changes of cervical spine in ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is characterised by its effects on the axial skeleton. The cervical spine is also vulnerable to the disease process. Our aim was to determine the frequency of radiologic changes to the cervical spine and their correlation with clinical variables. We also used the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Index (BASRI) system, which is one of the reliable scoring systems of radiography, to score the global radiologic changes to the cervical and lumbar spine and the hip joints in our AS cohort. There were 181 patients with anteroposterior and lateral full-flexion views on radiography of the cervical spine here included in the study. A radiologist examined the radiologic changes to all anatomical compartments of the cervical spine in detail and graded them according to the BASRI system. We used the clinical and demographic data of our AS cohort to determine their relation to the radiographic changes. Eighty-eight patients (48.6%) showed radiological changes to the cervical spine to the discovertebral joint 35.9%
