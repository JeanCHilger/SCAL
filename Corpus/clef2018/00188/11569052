Our experience in 33 cases of thoracolumbar fracture treated by transpedicle instrument. Unstable thoracolumbar fracture (vertebromedullary traumatic lesion) is often the cause of poor sequelae, in lumbar pain caused by changes in the physiological sagittal profile, and sequelae of a neurologic nature. Thus, the concept of instability is further defined. The authors presents 33 cases of burst type thoracolumbar fractures treated by transpedicle instrumentation using the following systems: Malaga vertebral fixator 1,2 (MVF), Omega 21. Follow-up was obtained after rom 1 to 9 years. Results were: clinical-radiographic criteria (1. fusion, 2. deformity, 3. pain, 4. neurologic function). There was remodeling of the spinal cord canal in cases operated on. The authors conclude that a correct evaluation of instability of burst fractures and the consequent treatment of choice (transpedicle fixation) allows for a high favorable index of the functional capacity in these patients.
