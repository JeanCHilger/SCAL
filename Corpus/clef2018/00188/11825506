Clinical application of TMS-MEP in spinal cord injury. To evaluate transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potential (TMS-MEP) in the diagnosis of spinal cord injury.56 patients with injury of the spinal cord and cauda equina were examined using TMS-MEP and followed up.In 21 patients with complete paralysis, TMS-MEP of bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius disappeared and paralysis did not recover. Abnormal was noted TMS-MEP and paralysis not recovered in 2 patients with injury of conus medullaris and cauda equina. Incomplete paralysis occurred in 35 patients. TMS-MEPs of more than one muscle in every patient were recorded. Paralysis and TMS-MEPs recovered in different degree in the 33 patients, in which the strength was 0 class and TMS-MEPs were abnormal in 25 target muscles before operation whereas their strength obviously recovered or even normalized after operation except two muscles.TMS-MEP is an effective method for diagnosis and prognosis of spinal cord injury.
