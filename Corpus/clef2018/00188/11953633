Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma of the spine: experiences with 22 patients. Osteoblastomas and osteoid osteomas of the spine are relatively rare bone-forming tumors. Between 1980 and 1999, nine patients with osteoid osteoma and 13 patients with osteoblastoma had surgery for their tumors. Four tumors were in the cervical spine, six tumors were in thoracic spine, 10 tumors were in the lumbar spine, and two tumors were in the sacrum. The average duration between onset of pain and surgery was 16.6 months in 12 patients treated in the 1980s and 8.6 months in 10 patients treated in the 1990s. Seventeen patients had scoliosis. In nine of 10 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans, high signal intensity areas in the muscles and bone around the lesion were seen. Two of nine patients with osteoid osteoma and nine of 13 patients with osteoblastoma had neurologic disorders before treatment. All patients had open resection of the lesions. Two patients with osteoid osteoma had relapse because of incomplete resection, necessitating a second excision. In 16 of 17 patients with preoperative spinal deformity, the deformity improved during followup. With development of modern imaging techniques, exact surgical planning may become possible however, in some cases, intraoperative complete resection of the lesion still is difficult.
