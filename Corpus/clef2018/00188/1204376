Advantages of the prone position for neurosurgical procedures on the upper cervical spine and posterior cranial fossa in children. The authors have reviewed the charts of 107 patients undergoing 119 surgical procedures in the prone position for posterior fossa or upper cervical lesions. The intraoperative complications encountered include cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory complications, cardiac arrest, hypothermia, air embolus and technical difficulties. In all but three children the problems were minor and easily remedied. The use of controlled ventilation appears to reduce blood loss, permits excellent relaxation of the exposed tissues and had some anesthetic advantages.
