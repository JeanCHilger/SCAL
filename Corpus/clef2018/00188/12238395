Surgical treatment of advanced congenital scoliosis with the C-D method. The paper presents the results of surgical treatment of 15 cases of congenital scolisios with CD instrumentation. Progression of the deformity was most often seen in cases with combined deformities (according to the McMaster classification). Indications for surgical treatment were progression of the curvature and trunk and thorax deformity progression, particularly during the growth spurt. The age at the time of surgery ranged from 10.3 to 16 years (average: 13.8 years). Follow-up period ranged from 2 to 8 years (average: 4 years). Intraoperative deformity correction ranged from 0 to 60% (average 32%). Loss of correction during follow up ranged from 0 to 3%. The overall silhouette improvement was a result of correction of the spine curvature, correction of thoracic hyperkiphosis and a decrease of trunk decompensation. The only complications noted were 3 cases of transient neurological symptoms from the lower extremities. Preoperative MRI allows detection of congenital deformities of the spinal canal, a contraindication for surgical correction of the deformity with spinal implants.
