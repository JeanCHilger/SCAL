Primary intradural extramedullary hydatidosis. Case report and review of the literature. The authors report a case of cauda equina compression by intradural hydatid cyst. An 18-year-old man presented with paraparesis and sphincter dysfunction. MRI showed an intradural cystic lesion extending from L1 to L2 with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2. The cyst was removed after laminectomy and opening of the dural sac. Histological and parasitic examinations confirmed a diagnosis of hydatid cyst. The patient improved progressively after surgery. The similar 22 cases of intradural extramedullary hydatid disease reported in the literature were reviewed. All spinal areas were involved, with a predilection for the thoracic region. Neurological complications were usual with rapid spinal cord compression in this rare form of hydatid disease. The treatment was by surgery with a favourable outcome compared to the classic hydatid cyst of the spine.
