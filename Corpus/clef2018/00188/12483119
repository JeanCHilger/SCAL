Imaging findings in 122 cases of Pott's disease. Spinal tuberculosis is a frequent skeletal involvement in tuberculosis. We report 122 cases between 1983 and 1998 of Pott's disease explored by plain radiographies in all cases, CT-scan in 22 cases and MRI in 6 cases. The lesion involved one localization in 98 cases, two localizations in 9 cases and multiple localizations in 15 cases. The usual form associating the discal and vertebral involvement was noted in 70%. Unusual forms were seen in 30% of the cases The localizations were: posterior arch (20 cases), centrosomatic (10 cases), suboccipital (4 cases) and subligamentar (2 cases). In addition, the CT scan noted vertebral lesion with soft tissue abscess in all cases and epidural lesion in 9 cases. MRI performed in 6 cases showed epidural lesions in 4 cases: epiduritis (2 cases) and abscess (2 cases). The disco-vertebral puncture-biopsy, performed in 12 cases, confirmed the diagnosis in 7 cases. The diagnosis of Pott's disease was confirmed biologically in 30 cases. Radiographic exploration of Pott's disease is improved by the contributions of CT and MRI which can identify sequestra, perilesional sclerosis and epidural or soft tissue abscesses. Discovertebral aspiration biopsy provides the key to diagnosis.
