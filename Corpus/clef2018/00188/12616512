One-fascicle median nerve transfer to biceps muscle in C5 and C6 root avulsions of brachial plexus injury. Five male patients with avulsions of the C5 and C6 roots of the brachial plexus underwent transfer of one fascicle of the median nerve to the motor branch of the biceps muscle. The mean period of follow-up was 32 months. The average reinnervation time of the biceps was 3.4 months. Four patients achieved biceps strength of Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4, and one patient had strength of the biceps of MRC grade 3. The mean period of time from surgery to MRC grade 3 was 9 months. At the last follow-up examination, grip strength, pinch strength, moving two-point discrimination, and strength of wrist volar flexion on the affected side were not worse than before the operation in any patient.
