Anterior plating for lower cervical spine tuberculosis. Sixteen patients with tuberculosis of the lower cervical spine and neurological complication or unacceptable kyphosis were treated by anterior debridement, fusion and H-plate fixation. The follow-up was 38 (13-72) months. All cases had bony fusion. There were no increased neurological deficits. Out of 14 patients with neurological manifestations, 12 showed complete recovery and two marked improvements. Kyphosis improved from 21.6 degrees (5-70 degrees) preoperatively to 2.5 degrees (-6-20 degrees) at the latest follow-up. The major advantage of the anterior instrumentation was better correction of the deformity.
