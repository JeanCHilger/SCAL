A case of cerivco-thoracic anomaly simulating traumatic fracture-dislocation. A patient who sustained severe head trauma had a simulated C7, T1 fracture dislocation. Anteroposterior tomography of the cervico-thoracic junction disclosed anomalous vertebral-costal articulations. The rotation of the spine and the abnormal posterior articulations were secondary to anterior costal bridging. Tomography of the costo-vertebral facets in patients with unusual rib configurations may help delineate cases of thoracic spine rotation.
