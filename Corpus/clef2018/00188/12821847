Subacute Propionibacterium acnes osteomyelitis of the spine in an adolescent. Moderate to severe facial acne is caused by infection with Propionibacterium acnes, an organism that has also been implicated in subacute osteomyelitis. The symptoms are often indolent in nature, but slowly progressive. We present a case report of subacute P. acnes osteomyelitis at our institution. A high index of suspicion and an extended incubation time are required for diagnosis. Treatment usually requires irrigation and debridement, with or without antibiotics.
