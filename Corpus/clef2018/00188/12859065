Relationship between alignment of upper and lower cervical spine in asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to establish standard values for the normal alignment of the upper cervical spine and to clarify its relationship with the lower cervical spine in terms of alignmentThree hundred thirteen asymptomatic volunteers (155 men and 158 women) participated in this study. Lateral radiographs were obtained with the neck in neutral position, and the angles formed by the occiput (Oc) and the axis, the atlas and the axis, and C-2 to C-7 were measured. The mean Oc-C2 angle was 14.5 +/- 8 degrees in men and 16 +/- 8.5 degrees in women the mean C1-2 angle was 26.5 +/- 7 degrees and 28.9 +/- 6.7 degrees, respectivelySuch relationships between alignment of the upper and lower cervical spines should be taken into consideration when performing occipitocervical fusion.
