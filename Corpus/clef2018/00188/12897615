Second cervical vertebrae pedicle fractures versus synchondrosis in a child. Fractures of the second cervical vertebrae (C2) can be difficult to diagnose in young children. A 17-month-old infant sustained bilateral C2 pedicle fractures after minor trauma. The initial lateral radiograph showed pedicle defects, but even with computed tomography and a bone scan with single photon emission computed tomography this could not be differentiated from a congenital abnormality. One week after injury, repeat radiographs showed spondylolisthesis confirming the defects were fractures. The fractures were treated by closed reduction and a halo vest and healed uneventfully. This child is among a small number of patients with bilateral C2 pedicle fractures that occur predominantly in young children. Diagnosis can be difficult even with a high index of suspicion.
