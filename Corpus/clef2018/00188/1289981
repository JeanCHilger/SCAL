Instability and misdiagnosed or neglected dislocations of the upper cervical spine in children. Apropos of 20 cases. Neglected instabilities or luxations of the upper cervical spine in children are rare if one discards conditions such as chondrodysplasia, Down Syndrome or others, were the spine is known to be at high risk of instability. We have studied twenty cases of neglected luxations and the delay in diagnosis is explained either by the asymptomatic character of some of these lesions, or by the difficulty in diagnosis. At the occipito-atlantal level we have reviewed: an instability in translation which required an occipito-axial fusion two compensatory counter occipito-atlantal luxation of an atlanto-axial rotatory fixation. The diagnosis was best made with computed tomography scan and the treatment was not much different from the isolated atlanto-axial rotatory luxation. An instability in flexion extension, which was merely followed at regular intervals. At the atlanto-axial level 9 cases of sagittal instabilities in kyphosis and translation with a distance between atlas and axis of more than 5 mm were observed. These instabilities were most often associated with a malformation of the cranio-cervical junction
