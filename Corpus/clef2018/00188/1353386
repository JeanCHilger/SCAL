A study of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker prazosin in the prophylactic management of autonomic dysreflexia in high spinal cord injury patients. The ability of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, to reduce the severity and duration of episodes of autonomic dysreflexia was studied in cervical and high thoracic spinal cord injury patients with documented episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. Sixteen patients participated in a double blind parallel group study comparing prazosin 3 mg b.d. with placebo given for 2 weeks. Both groups were matched for age, sex and baseline severity of autonomic dysreflexia episodes. Prazosin was well tolerated and did not produce a significant lowering of resting blood pressure. Compared to baseline measurements, patients allocated to prazosin therapy were found to have fewer severe episodes of autonomic dysreflexia and during these episodes to have significant reductions in average rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, symptom duration and requirement for acute antihypertensive medication. The severity of headache during individual autonomic dysreflexia episodes was also diminished with prazosin therapy. No symptom parameter was significantly altered by placebo therapy. It is concluded that prazosin is superior to placebo in the prophylactic management of autonomic dysreflexia and that these findings are consistent with suggestions that alpha-1 adrenoceptors play an important role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
