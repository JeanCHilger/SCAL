Traumatic cervical syringomyelia related to birth injury. A rare case of cervical syringomyelia related to breech delivery is reported. The initial diagnosis was bilateral brachial plexus palsy due to birth injury, which was revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be traumatic syringomyelia. The usefulness of MRI in the early diagnosis of cervical cord birth injury, especially in differentiating between brachial plexus palsy due to birth injury and spinal cord trauma due to birth injury in infancy, is emphasized.
