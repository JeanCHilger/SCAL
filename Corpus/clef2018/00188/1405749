Chyle leakage after blunt trauma. Three patients developed chylous leakage after major blunt trauma. In one patient with non-remitting right-sided chylothorax, lymphangioscintigraphy as well as conventional oil contrast lymphography demonstrated disruption of the thoracic duct at the aortic hiatus which eventually required transpleural mediastinal ductal ligation proximal to the fistula. The other two patients had chylous retroperitoneum and/or chylous peritoneum which was self-limited although one patient (a three-year-old boy) died of multiorgan failure from associated pulmonary contusions and cervical spine injuries. Chylous leak after non-penetrating trauma is usually attributed to hyperflexion-extension of the vertebral column with shearing of tethered lymphatics. Alternatively, sudden compression of lipemic and engorged mesenteric lymphatics, adjacent nodes and the lower thoracic duct aggravated by deformations associated with stretching and tearing motions may also directly disrupt chyle-containing lymphatics.
