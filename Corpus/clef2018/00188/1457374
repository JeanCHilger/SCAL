Perinatal spinal cord injury: clinical, radiographic and pathologic features. Perinatal spinal cord injury is a relatively uncommon, but a frequently misdiagnosed disorder. Often, the injury is not suspected and an erroneous diagnosis is made. We present five cases of perinatal spinal cord injury. In four, the referring physicians (including pediatric neurologists) misdiagnosed the condition. In view of these diagnostic difficulties, we review the clinical, radiographic and pathologic aspects of these injuries. Serious spinal injuries occasionally occur in the perinatal period. With improving medical care, many infants with less severe injuries are surviving the neonatal period. Therefore, the prompt recognition of neonatal spinal cord damage is essential and allows for optimal treatment of the injured child.
