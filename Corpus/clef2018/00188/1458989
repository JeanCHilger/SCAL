Use of internal fixator in injuries of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Between 1984 and 1989 51 patients with spinal traumata received surgical treatment by means of Fixateur interne. The results of patients' postsurgical check-up were as follows: Cases with incomplete neurological dysfunctions (levels Frankel B-D)-especially lumbar-showed improvements of neurological deficiencies up to three levels Frankel after emergency decompression and stabilization. The majority of cases with complete paraplegia-especially thoracic-did not subside. This holds true even for the results of a second check-up after about three years. A correlation between the degree of stenosis of the spinal canal and the neurological dysfunctions could not be established. The results of segmental stabilization by means of internal fixator and of definitive spondylodesis by means of autogenous spongiosa were positive, as was the spine proof and the patients' postsurgical function.
