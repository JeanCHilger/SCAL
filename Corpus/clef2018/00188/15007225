In utero spontaneous cervical thoracic epidural hematoma imitating spinal cord birth injury. A neonate male born cesarian due to a breech presentation was noted to have no spontaneous movements of the limbs after delivery. Radiographs were not demonstrative of pathology. However, MRI revealed a large intraspinal mass with significant distortion of the cervicothoracic spinal cord. At operation, a brown, fibro-gelatinous, moderately adherent mass was evident extradurally dorsal to the spinal cord. It was noted to extend anterolaterally to the left such that the cord was deviated anteriorly and to the right. There was no indication of the mass being under pressure but the cord was not pulsatile. There was sufficient mass to the anterolateral component of the cord that it appeared rotated to the right within the canal. The right cervical roots exited dorsally, with a markedly lengthened course through the spinal canal before exiting above their respective pedicles. Histology was that of blood clot. The patient clinically demonstrated no neurologic improvement post-operatively. Now, six months after surgery, the patient has still had no significant change in clinical function. To our review, this is the first reported case of a spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma mimicking a birth-related spinal injury.
