Is implant removal after percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation of unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions indicated?. The aim of this study was to examine the indication for implant removal (IR) after percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation of unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions by systematic literature analysis and clinical follow-up examination. Retrospective identification revealed 27 operatively stabilized patients [12 females, mean age: 35 years, ISS 22 points (range: 14-37)] between January 1996 and July 2001. Patient characteristics, AO classification, Hannover fracture scale pelvis, ISS, and DGU pelvis score points were analyzed. All cases showed a C-type lesion (C1:67%, C2:33%). A total of 21 patients were seen at follow-up, 12 with and 9 without IR. In ten cases with IR, clinical outcome improved after surgery according to the DGU pelvis score ( p=0.001, Wilcoxon's test). These mostly young patients also showed a better outcome compared with those cases without IR. Due to the good clinical results, implant removal seems to be beneficial for selected individual patients, especially when pain is present.
