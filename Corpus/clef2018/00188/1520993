Unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures treated with the AO fixateur interne. Twenty-five consecutive patients with unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were surgically treated with the AO Fixateur Interne (Synthes USA, 1690 Russell Rd., Paoli, PA). Indications for surgery included a progressive neurologic deficit, spinal canal compromise greater than 50%, vertebral body collapse greater than 50%, or sagittal angulation greater than 20 degrees. Twenty males and five females ranging in age from 16 to 60 years (average 31) were treated surgically and prospectively followed. Twenty-one fractures occurred at the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2) and 4 in the lumbar spine (L3-5). Twenty-four patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months, ranging from 12 to 38 months (average 22) one patient was lost to follow-up after 1 month postoperatively.
