How often should computed tomographic scans following cross-table lateral cervical films be performed? In patients with blunt trauma, a cross-table lateral cervical (CTLC) film is followed by a focused computed tomographic (CT) scan of the cervical spine to assess an area inadequately delineated by common techniques and suspected injuries, based on recent guidelines in the United States. The purpose of this study was to calculate the frequency of such supplemental CT scans and to evaluate the efficacy of the recent guidelines describing the use of CTLC films as an indicator of supplemental focused CT scanning in Japan.A review of CTLC films was performed. 100 initial CTLC films with injuries and another 100 films without injuries were evaluated for the lowest vertebra visualised on the CTLC film. The frequency of abnormal signs on the CTLC films was then examined.Technically adequate CTLC films that showed the upper border of the T1 vertebra were not obtained from 70 patients with injuries and 63 patients without injuries. 88 patients with injuries and 28 patients without injuries had abnormal findings on CTLC films. Overall, 97 patients with injuries and 74 patients without injuries should have received supplemental CT scans.CTLC films require frequent supplemental use of CT, even for patients without cervical spine injuries. Thus, the guidelines that consider CTLC film as an indicator of the necessity for CT scanning are not efficient and need revision.
