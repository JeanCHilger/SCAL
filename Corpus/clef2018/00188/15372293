A case of progressive myelopathy with atlas hypoplasia in an infant: controversy in the surgical strategy. The authors report a case of isolated atlas hypoplasia in an 18-month-old infant who experienced delayed motor development confined to the lower extremities, in the absence of other clinical features. Nonetheless, MRI revealed the upper cervical cord to be highly compressed with a high signal intensity lesion apparent at the craniovertebral junction. The patient underwent atlas laminectomy in addition to occipital decompression, resulting in a good neurological recovery.We speculate on the significance of this unique clinical presentation and discuss surgical strategies for this condition.
