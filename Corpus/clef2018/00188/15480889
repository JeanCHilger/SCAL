Neurological recovery and its influencing factors in thoracic and lumbar spine fractures after surgical decompression and stabilization. Surgical decompression and internal fixation of the injured spine have become standard procedures in the management of thoracic and lumbar spine fractures, but their effectiveness on neurological recovery remains controversial. We report on 169 consecutive patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures who were treated by reduction, fusion, and internal fixation using transpedicular screw-rod systems. Open decompression was carried out in 67 (39.6%) of them, including all 42 patients (25%) who presented with initial neurological deficits. At least 8 months following surgery, 30 (71%) had neurologically improved by one to three grades on the Frankel scale. Thirteen (59%) out of 22 patients whose initial deficits had been classified as "motor useless" (Frankel grades A to C) could walk, at least with support. Thirteen out of 20 patients with posttraumatic deficit Frankel D ("motor useful") improved to full recovery (Frankel E). In six (3.6%) patients (all from the group of the 127 patients without initial neurological deficits), permanent slight postoperative neurological impairment of one Frankel grade (E to D) was seen, among them two (1.2%) with new minor motor deficit. Neurological outcome was significantly better (p<0.01) in patients operated upon within the first 24 h after injury than in those who underwent surgery later. Severity of injury also had a negative influence (p<0.001) on neurological recovery. Analysis suggests that there may be significant neurological improvement in patients treated surgically very early.
