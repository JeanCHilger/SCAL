Bone mass, bone metabolism, and prevalence of spinal fractures in recipients of allogenic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate in 65 patients, who had previously undergone allogenic bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), the bone mineral density (BMD), the skeletal turnover and the prevalence of vertebral fractures. At the moment of recruiting, 10 of 65 transplanted subjects (15.3%) presented with signs of rejection of the transplanted tissue, thus they were excluded. The remaining 55 patients (21 males, 34 females, mean age 30.8 +/- 6.4 years), with a follow-up of 60 +/- 9 months after the transplant and without any treatment inducing osteopenia, underwent ABMT respectively for: chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 24) acute myeloid leukemia (n = 18)
