Adequacy of plain radiography in the diagnosis of cervical spine injuries. Our hypotheses were (1) that plain radiography of the cervical spine in the evaluation of low risk patients with minor blunt trauma is accurate and (2) that computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine in the evaluation of low risk patients is unnecessary. This study evaluates those hypotheses. We prospectively recorded findings of all patients with blunt trauma who underwent imaging over a period of 70 days. Injury status was determined by review of all radiographic studies obtained on each patient. Chart reviews were performed to determine mechanism of injury and neurological status. Patients were divided into three groups: very low risk, low risk, and high risk. Study end point was fracture. The study included 219 patients. The very low risk group had 107 patients, none of whom had fractures found on CT (projected specificity of plain radiography: 100%). The low risk group contained 78 patients who had no fractures seen on plain radiography or CT (specificity of plain radiography and CT: 100%). The high risk group consisted of 34 patients 15 had fractures demonstrated on CT. Plain radiography missed one fracture out of 15. In low risk patients, plain radiography is an efficient diagnostic exam with a specificity of 100%. In high risk patients, plain radiography is a good adjunctive screening exam in conjunction with CT scan, with a sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 95%.
