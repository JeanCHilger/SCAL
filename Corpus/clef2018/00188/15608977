Traumatic fracture of the thoracic spine T1-T10. We describe the incidence, causes, management and prognosis of traumatic fractures of the thoracic spine from T1 to T10 in surgical cases of traumatic fractures of spine during the period from June 1994 to June 2003 studied retrospectively. The type of fracture was determined according to the Gertzbein classification, and the degree of stability using the Denis classification. The neurological picture at admission and 30 days after surgery was evaluated using the ASIA/IMSOP classification. Surgery was performed in patients with complete spinal cord injury (n=7) for the purpose of stabilization using the posterior approach. In cases without spinal cord injury or incomplete injury (n=12), the surgical procedure was performed aiming to decompress the nerve tissue, to correct the alignment of the spine and to stabilize the spine.
