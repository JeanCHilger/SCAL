Muscle atrophy after treatment with Halovest. A prospective study was conducted on the sequential changes in the muscles around the cervical spine following external fixation for an extended period.Muscular atrophy around the cervical spine following prolonged external fixation with a Halovest and subsequent recovery from the atrophy were examined.There are a number of reports on the usefulness of the Halovest. However, there have been no descriptions about muscular atrophy following fixation by the Halovest.The study participants were 10 patients who were conservatively treated by the Halovest. Imaging by CT was performed periodically following fixation by the Halovest. The cross sections of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the nuchal muscle group at C5-C6 were computed by using NIH Image Software. The results were used to evaluate muscular atrophy following fixation by the Halovest and the subsequent recovery after removal of the fixation.Following fixation by the Halovest, atrophy of the muscles around cervical spine sequentially progressed. Three months after fixation, muscular atrophy was about 15% at the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 22% for the nuchal muscle group, but the patients recovered from the atrophic state following the removal of the device.Following fixation by the Halovest, muscular atrophy around the cervical spine sequentially progressed. After the device was removed, however, the muscles recovered from the atrophic state. Muscular atrophy caused by prolonged fixation by the Halovest was a reversible change.
