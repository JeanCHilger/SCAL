Surgery for fractures of the lower extremities in cases of chronic spinal cord injury. According to the literature, the need for surgical treatment of fractures of the lower extremity in patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is very limited. Conservative management is usually presented as the treatment of choice. We present the results of a retrospective review of 55 fractures in 44 patients from 1996 to 2000 which were managed surgically. Rating of the outcome was based on basic clinical and radiological criteria. The results of the radiological investigation on bone remodeling and bone positioning after healing were rated as good or excellent in 43 and fair in five limbs. In five cases, the treatment failed. For 53 of the 55 fractures, the patients regained their normal level of independence. Comparing our results to those presented in the literature, we clearly had fewer complications as well as better clinical and radiological results. We therefore advocate surgical treatment as an appropriate choice of treatment for lower extremity fractures of patients with chronic SCI.
