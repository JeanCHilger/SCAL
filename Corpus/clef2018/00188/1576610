Spontaneous spinal extradural hematoma in children. Report of three cases and a review of the literature. Three young children who presented with acute backache and rapidly progressive neurological deterioration were investigated and found to have spontaneous spinal extradural hematoma (SSEDH). They were operated on soon after the diagnosis had been confirmed. The present report highlights the fact that in children progressive weakness of nontraumatic origin should be investigated thoroughly and as early as possible. Patients with SSEDH should be operated on immediately, as this is a curable condition. The pertinent literature has been reviewed.
