Anterior instrumentation for cervical spine tuberculosis: an analysis of surgical experience with 61 cases. To evaluate the efficacy of anterior instrumentation in patients with subaxial and cervicodorsal spinal tuberculosis in reconstruction of the spine, providing pain relief, neurological recovery and prevention of deformity.The records of 61 consecutive patients, of surgically treated spinal tuberculosis affecting C3 to D2 region, in our neuro and spinal surgery unit over a five-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with involvement of the C3-C6 vertebrae underwent excision of the involved vertebrae and intervertebral discs followed by reconstruction with titanium implants by anterior approach. A transclavicular approach was used for patients with involvement of the C7-D2 vertebrae. A five-drug antituberculous regimen was administered for a period of one year. The follow-up ranged from 24 to 84 months (mean 38 months). Clinical and radiological assessment using flexion and extension radiographs was performed at 24 months for all cases.The neck pain score based on a visual analog scale (1-10) changed from a pre-operative average of 7 to 2 at follow-up after 4 months. Fifty-two patients (85%) had complete relief of pain while 16 patients who had Grade III to IV muscle strength regained complete power. The asymmetric wasting in patients with involvement of the cervicodorsal region did not recover completely. Flexion-extension radiographs at 24 months did not show any evidence of instability or nonunion.Anterior reconstruction using titanium plates and locking screws for stabilization of the subaxial and cervicodorsal region tuberculosis is a useful adjunct in preventing kyphotic deformity. A satisfactory segmental stability and fusion is achieved by this technique.
