Implantable direct current stimulation in para-axial cervical arthrodesis. This retrospective, case-controlled pilot study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of an implantable direct current bone growth stimulator (IDCBGS) as an adjunct to cervical arthrodesis in patients at high risk for nonunion after undergoing cervical fusion in region from the occiput to C3. Twenty patients underwent para-axial cervical arthrodesis (involving posterior spine fusion and instrumentation using standard surgical techniques) for the correction of instability. All were at high risk for nonunion due to advanced age, rheumatoid arthritis, prior failed fusion attempts, infection, or immunosuppressive drug use. An IDCBGS was used to augment the surgical procedure. The mean follow-up period was 19 months, and 16 patients were available for follow-up. Radiographic evidence of fusion was demonstrated in 15 of 16 patients (94%). After surgery, all patients demonstrated clinical stabilization, a resolution of symptoms in combination with an improvement in neurologic status, or both. The mean elapsed time before fusion occurred was 4.6 months. No neurologic complications related to cathode or generator placement were observed. The use of the stimulator as an adjunct to instrument- or non-instrument-assisted surgical fusion of the para-axial region in these high-risk patients appeared both safe and efficacious. Further investigation is warranted to define the possible role and clinical utility of the IDCBGS in selected patients requiring cervical fusion, particularly those at high risk for nonunion.
