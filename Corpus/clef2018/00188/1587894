Spinal abnormalities in young fast bowlers. The action of fast bowling in the game of cricket is known to cause injuries to the lumbar spine. We studied a group of 16- to 18-year-old fast bowlers, selected for special training in Western Australia. All 24 had MR scans of the spine, 22 had radiographs and CT scans in 20 the bowling technique was analysed biomechanically. There was a high incidence of back pain and this was always associated with a radiological abnormality. Pars interarticularis defects were diagnosed in 54% and intervertebral disc degeneration in 63%. Bowling actions which involved counter-rotation were associated with a higher incidence of both injuries.
