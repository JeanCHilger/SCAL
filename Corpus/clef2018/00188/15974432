An evaluation of the third cervical vertebra (C3) as a growth indicator in Black subjects. In orthodontics, evaluation of skeletal age and growth maturation is essential in diagnosis and treatment planning. The use of hand wrist radiographs perform this function adequately. However, it is not the only method, as the body of the third cervical vertebra (C3) also provides a similar information. It may be clearly discerned on the routine cephalogram, obviating additional radiation. This study sets out to present the various morphologic changes observed radiographically in the body of C3 at different age groups. The cephalograms of one hundred and sixty two patients (79 males and 83 females) were evaluated from the records at the Medunsa Orthodontic Department. The body of C3 was studied on each film according to the criteria set by Hassel & Farman. The results showed that radiographically, the body of C3 displayed morphological changes consistent with normal skeletal maturation that indicated the usefulness of this technique in clinical and research work. This method therefore shows promise as an alternative to hand wrist growth stage evaluation.
