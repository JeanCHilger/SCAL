Chance-type flexion-distraction injuries in the thoracolumbar spine: MR imaging characteristics. To evaluate retrospectively the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of Chance-type flexion-distraction injuries.The authors' institutional review board does not require its approval or patient informed consent for retrospective studies. Imaging data were reviewed retrospectively for 24 patients (15 male, nine female mean age, 28 yearsCombined bone and soft-tissue injuries occurred in 23 (96%) of 24 patients, were more common than soft-tissue damage alone (one [4%] of 24 patients), and occurred primarily at the thoracolumbar junction. Contiguous vertebral injury was seen in 20 (83%) of 24 patients, usually in the form of anterosuperior vertebral endplate edema, while noncontiguous injury occurred in eight (33%) of 24 patients. Extensive subcutaneous and paraspinal muscle edema was seen in all patients and extended over several segments. Posterior osteoligamentous complex disruption also occurred in all patients. Horizontally oriented fractures of the posterior neural arches produced an MR imaging pattern that the authors call the sandwich sign, which consists of linear hemorrhage framed by marrow edema. This sign was seen in 12 (50%) of 24 patients. In seven (29%) of 24 patients, a fracture line extending from a damaged pedicle was seen to exit through the contralateral posterosuperior aspect of the vertebral body, with extension of the fracture fragments into the spinal canal.A spectrum of features is discernible with MR imaging in Chance-type injuries.
