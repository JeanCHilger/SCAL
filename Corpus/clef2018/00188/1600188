The use of functional electrical stimulation to assist gait in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury. The use of FES (functional electrical stimulation) for gait reproduction in six patients with spinal cord injury is described. Following a detailed neuromuscular assessment the patients commenced a muscle conditioning programme using electrical stimulation applied via surface electrodes. Once patients were strong enough to stand, gait synthesis was initiated in the laboratory utilizing a programmable electrical stimulator. When a satisfactory gait pattern had been achieved, patients used their portable stimulator at home. All six patients became able to stand and walk using the FES system and completed the home phase of the programme. Three patients continue to use the system at home for exercise and walking the other patients have discontinued using the system, preferring a wheelchair or their original orthoses. We conclude that FES-assisted walking is feasible in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury, even with severe motor loss. Further advances in technology are needed for the system to become applicable to a larger number of patients.
