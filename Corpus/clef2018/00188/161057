Aneurysmal vertebra cyst (observation on two cases with neurological findings) (author's transl). The authors report 2 cases of aneurysmal cysts of the spinal cord with neurological manifestations. The first case was a young girl of 16 years of age with a lesion at the D6 level and spasmodic paraparesis. The second case was a boy aged 5 years with a lesions at the L3 level and lumbar pains. The characteristic "one-eyed vertebra" appearance was present in the radiological images in both cases, and was confirmed histologically on operation, which produced good results.
