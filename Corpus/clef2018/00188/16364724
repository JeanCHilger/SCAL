The transmanubrial approach: a new operative approach to cervicothoracic neuroblastoma in children. Cervicothoracic neuroblastoma originates from the cervical sympathetic nerves and ganglia and thus presents a problem when dissecting the vascular and nervous elements of the subclavian region. The standard operation is based on thoracotomy or dual cervicotomy/thoracotomy, but these approaches do not provide optimal control of the subclavian vessels. We report our experience in children with cervicothoracic neuroblastoma by using a technique usually performed for apical lung cancer.Four patients with localized cervicothoracic neuroblastoma with no N-myc amplification were resected after chemotherapy by this approach. The anatomic evaluation was performed preoperatively with angio-magnetic resonance imaging. This transmanubrial approach, performed through a manubrial L-shaped transection and first costal cartilage resection, affords excellent access to the subclavian region with safe control of the vessels and nerves and exposure of the first 4 thoracic intervertebral foramina.Removal of more than 90% of the tumor was possible in all cases. The postoperative course was uneventful in 3 cases, and the fourth patient with a left-sided tumor had a transient chylothorax. No recurrence occurred with a follow-up period of 8 to 32 months.The transmanubrial approach is an osteomuscular-sparing technique that seems particularly suitable for the treatment of these tumors, which require a resection that is as complete as possible to avoid postoperative chemotherapy and tumor relapse.
