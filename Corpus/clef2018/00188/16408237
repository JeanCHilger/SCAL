Spine fractures caused by horse riding. Retrospective study and review of literature.Study of demographic data concerning spinal fractures caused by horse riding, classification of fractures according to the AO and Load Sharing classifications, evaluation of mid-term radiological results and long-term functional results.A review of medical reports and radiological examinations of patients presented to our hospital with horse riding-related spine fractures over a 13-year period long-term functional follow-up is performed using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-24).Thirty-six spine fractures were found in 32 patients. Male to female ratio is 1:7. Average age is 33.7 years (8-58 years). The majority of the fractures (78%) are seen at the thoracolumbar junction Th11-L2. All but two patients have AO type A fractures. The average Load Sharing Classification score is 4.9 (range 3-9). Neurological examinations show ASIA/Frankel E status for all patients. Surgical treatment is performed on ten patients. Mean follow-up for radiological data is 15 months (range 3-63). Functional follow-up times range from 1 to 13 years with an average follow-up of 7.3 years. Mean RMDQ-24 score for all patients is 5.5 (range: 0-19), with significantly different scores for the non-operative and surgical group: 4.6 vs 8.1. Twenty-two percent of the patients have permanent occupational disabilities and there is a significant correlation between occupational disability and RMDQ-24 scores.Not only are short-term effects of spine fractures caused by horse riding substantial but these injuries can also lead to long-term disabilities.
