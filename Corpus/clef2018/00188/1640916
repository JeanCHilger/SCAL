Cervical trauma in the pathogenesis of cranio-cervico-mandibular dysfunctions. A sudden cervical extension-flexion (whiplash) can cause a temporomandibular pathology with a direct and indirect mechanism of action. A total of 24 patients of both sexes who had undergone acute cervical trauma, which had led to masticatory dysfunction of a meniscal or algomyo-facial type, were examined. The most frequent signs and symptoms were regional pain, a qualitative and quantitative change in movements, cephalea, and articular noise. A complete condylo-meniscal block was observed in three cases. Concomitant radiographic tests using a trans-cranial projection confirmed clinical findings. A multidisciplinary individual therapeutic approach ensured complete functional recovery prognosis varied with regard to cephalalgia which is related to the individual's psycho-behavioural substrate. The paper stresses the importance of early diagnosis and targeted treatment in order to prevent symptoms from becoming chronic thus making the disorder a disability which is difficult to treat.
