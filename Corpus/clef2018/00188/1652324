Ilizarov apparatus for infected pseudarthrosis of the spine: a case report. A case is presented of a 13-year-old girl with thoracic level myelomeningocele who developed an infected pseudarthrosis of the lumbar spine after an attempted kyphosectomy. The pseudarthrosis was successfully united through the use of special modifications of the Ilizarov apparatus. Rings and wires were applied to the iliac wings below and the thoracic laminae above the pseudarthrosis site. Preoperative planning was aided by a CT scan of the pelvis and spine. A cut-out foam mattress and a special wheelchair were used postoperatively to facilitate patient care.
