Cervical spine abnormalities associated with Down syndrome. Atlantoaxial instability (AAI) affects 10-20% of individuals with Down syndrome (DS). The condition is mostly asymptomatic and diagnosed on radiography by an enlarged anterior atlanto-odontoid distance. Symptomatic AAI, which affects 1-2% of individuals with DS, manifests with spinal cord compression. Cervical spondylosis, which is common in DS, also has the potential for cord damage but it has received less attention because paediatric populations were mostly studied. Forty-four Kuwaiti subjects with DS, whose ages were > or = 15 years, were evaluated clinically and radiographically. Lateral neck radiographs were taken in the neutral and flexion positions. Asymptomatic AAI was diagnosed in eight subjects (18%) and congenital anomalies of C1-2 were found in five (12%). Five patients had AAI in flexion only while three patients had it in both views. Three patients with AAI had odontoid anomalies contributing to the condition. When assessing AAI, the posterior atlanto-odontoid distance has to be considered because it indicates the space available for the cord. Cervical spondylosis was noted in 16 (36%) subjects. Degenerative changes increased with age, occurred earlier than in the normal population, and affected mostly the lower cervical levels. Half the patients with AAI had cervical spondylosis, a comorbidity that puts the cord at increased risk.
