Three-dimensional computerized tomography of fractures. In 32 patients with fractures of different localisation the transverse CT layers were compared with three-dimensional reconstructions. Evaluation showed that three-dimensional CT can better visualize complicated anatomical conditions especially if there are dislocated fragments in the facial part of the skull and in the trunk of the body. Hence, 3-D CT is a valuable complement to axial CT which, however, remains the basis of the findings. Misinterpretations are possible of the reconstructions are used alone because of the lack if visualization of the lesions of the soft parts that accompany fractures and because there may be pseudoforamina at thin osseous lamellae.
