Catastrophic intrauterine spinal cord injury caused by an arteriovenous malformation. We report a baby born with flaccid quadraparesis that was considered possibly attributable to birth injury. Postmortem examination identified an injury that occurred well before delivery caused by hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation of the brainstem and spinal cord. We discuss imaging modalities to diagnose neonatal cord injuries, possible treatments, prognosis and end of life decision making for these unfortunate patients. We also emphasize the importance of the autopsy in cases of suspected birth injury.
