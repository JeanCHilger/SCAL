Application of injury severity score to multiple injuries headed by spinal cord injury. To evaluate the application of injury severity score ( ISS) to multiple injuries headed by spinal cord injury.The data of 55 cases (40 males and 15 females, aged 17-69 years, mean equal to 41 years) of multiple injuries headed by spinal cord injury treated in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2004 were reviewed and analyzed with ISS (Version of AIS-2005) to explore their relationship.The ISS values increased with the number of injured regions, so did the complications. The recovery rate was negatively related to ISS values. During the period of immunity observation, the patients with ISS larger than 25 could undergo planned operations safely.Treatment for multiple injuries headed by spinal cord injury closely depends on the general and local conditions of the patients. ISS may provide useful data for the choice of treatment methods.
