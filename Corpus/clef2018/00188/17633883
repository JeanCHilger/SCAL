Retrospective analysis of the efficiency of radiation studies in closed injury to the lower cervical spine (C3-C7). The paper presents the results of an analysis of the efficiency of radiation diagnostic techniques in 101 patients with closed injury to the lower cervical spine. The analysis was made by comparing the data of study protocols with surgical findings and pathologists' reports. The sensitivity, specificity, and toxicity of X-ray study, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are presented in bony, soft tissue, and neural structural damages. The basic advantages in the description of injuries to the lower cervical spine are detectable during X-ray study, CT, and MRI.
