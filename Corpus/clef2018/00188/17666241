Pediatric head and neck trauma from all-terrain vehicle accidents. To characterize pediatric head and neck trauma from all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) at a single institution.Retrospective case series at a level I pediatric trauma center.Thirty-four patients were admitted: average age was 12 years, with 68% between 12 and 16 years and 32% under 12 years. The patient was the driver in 74% of cases and the passenger in 17% of cases. Driver average age was 12.7 years and passenger average age was 10.5 years. Seventy-six percent of children were not wearing helmets. Average hospital stay was 6 days, with 81% of cases discharged home. Central nervous system injuries were most common, followed by soft tissue injuries. Soft tissue repair was the most frequent procedure, and most maxillofacial fractures required operative intervention.ATV-related morbidity and mortality in children are significant public health issues amenable to primary prevention by prohibiting passengers on ATVs and requiring helmet use.National trends indicate increasing ATV-related injuries in children.
