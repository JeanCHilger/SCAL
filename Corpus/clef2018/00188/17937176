Congenital cervical vertebral dysmorphism. Syndromatic integration through radiological clinical correlation. Cervical spine dysmorphisms (CSD) occurs in an heterogeneous group of patients unified by the presence of congenital defects result from malalignment, formation or segmentation of the cervical spine generating disability. This problem requires comprehensive evaluation of patients with scoliosis diagnosis, correlating clinical and radiological findings and the presence of numerous abnormalities of other systems in order to give an opportunely syndrome diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of this patients with the aim to give them an integral rehabilitation treatment increasing their quality of life. In this study we described clinical and radiological findings in children with CSD diagnosis. We studied 47 consecutive outpatients of Pediatric Rehabilitation Division in Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitaci6n (INR) with scoliosis diagnosis. Sixteen patients (34%) had CSD diagnosis. Most frequently syndromes (Sx) were: Klippel-Feil Sx (19%), Wildervanck (4.3%), neurofibromatosis (4.3%), Morquio (2.1%), Stickler (2.1%) and Williams (2.1%). We found CSD diagnosis in 34% of group studied, greater than medical literature.
