Seatbelt induced chance fracture in an infant. Case report and literature review. Chance ("seat belt") fractures of the lumbar spine are extremely rare in the pediatric population and virtually unheard of in infants. We report a case of a 14 month old boy sustaining an isolated Chance fracture to L1 without associated spinal subluxation, dislocation, neurologic or visceral injury. He was being breast fed with his back beneath the passenger side shoulder harness when the vehicular front end collision causing his injury occurred. Thus, he may actually have sustained a hyperextension distraction or "Reverse Chance" fracture.
