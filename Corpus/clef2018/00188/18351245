"The swallowed bullet": illustration of a rare missile trajectory in a pediatric gunshot neck injury. The probability of a bullet deglutition is a remote cause of consultation.To communicate a clinical case of gunshot wound's penetrating cervical trauma in a pediatric patient, with a no frequent trajectory.We describe and illustrate a clinical case of penetrating neck gunshot wound in the left zone III. At the initial radiological examination, we observed an intraabdominal location of the bullet. The analysis of the clinical case demonstrated an oropharyngeal injury, and a "swallowed bullet", without other lesions.We observed a satisfactory evolution with a nonsurgical management. There was no associated morbidity.The gunshot bullet's trajectory generally implies a multiple organs lesion. In this case, the initial radiological location of the bullet deserved to rule out cervical, intrathoracic and intraabdominal organs injuries, allowing illustrate this infrequent and almost "harmless" trajectory.
