CT versus plain radiographs for evaluation of c-spine injury in young children: do benefits outweigh risks? Various reports support the use of cervical spine (c-spine) CT over conventional radiography in screening of c-spine injury. Interest now exists in diagnostic radiation-induced morbidity.To estimate excess relative risk for developing cancer from c-spine high-resolution CT radiation exposure.We conducted a retrospective review of children evaluated for c-spine injury using CT. The study population was divided into three age groups, 0-4 years (group 1), 5-8 years (group 2), and older than 8 years (group 3). Anthropomorphic 1-year-old and 5-year-old phantoms were used to measure radiation at the thyroid during radiography and CT. Excess relative risk for thyroid cancer was estimated using these measurements.A total of 557 patients were evaluated with CT. The radiographic method most commonly used was head CT/c-spine CT in 363 (65%). Only 179 children (32%) had any type of prior radiography. The use of c-spine CT exposes the thyroid to 90-200 times more radiation than multiple conventional radiographs. The mean excess relative risk for thyroid cancer after CT was 2.0 for group 1 and 0.6 for group 2. There were no comparison data for group 3.C-spine CT is associated with a significant exposure to ionizing radiation and increases excess relative risk for thyroid cancer in young children.
