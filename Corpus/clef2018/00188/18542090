Agreement of repeated motor and sensory scores at individual myotomes and dermatomes in young persons with complete spinal cord injury. Prospective repeated measures.Evaluate intra-rater agreement of repeated motor and sensory scores at individual spinal levels.Non-profit pediatric rehabilitation center.Fifty-eight youth with complete spinal cord injury undergoing two neurological exams. Agreement between exams for each myotome and dermatome was evaluated for four neurological groups: C1-C4 (N=9) C5-C8 (N=8)Agreement between strength scores was 99 and 100% in subjects with tetraplegia and paraplegia, respectively. C1-C4: pin prick (PP)=absolute agreement (AA) in 57% dermatomes (D) (k range=0.10-0.83 k(w) range=0.36-0.93). Light touch (LT)=AA in 59% D (k range=0.35-0.77Overall, agreement was excellent for myotome comparisons. For the C5-C8, T1-T6 and T7-T12 groups, there are variations in sensory scores within three levels of the neurological level (NL). For the C1-C4 group, variation in sensation extended well caudal to the NL. The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury is a good outcome measure for a single-site, one-rater study but differences in repeated sensory scores at individual D were found, which should be considered in the interpretation of results of outcome studies.
