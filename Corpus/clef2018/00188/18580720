Report of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry 2007 Adult Position Development Conference and Official Positions. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) periodically holds Position Development Conferences (PDCs) for the purpose of establishing standards and guidelines for the assessment of skeletal health -- the nomenclature, indications, acquisition, analysis, quality control, interpretation, and reporting of bone density tests. Topics are selected for consideration according to criteria that include clinical relevancy, uncertainty in the application of medical evidence to clinical practice, and the likelihood of the expert panel achieving agreement. The most recent Adult PDC was held July 20 to 22, 2007, in Lansdowne, Virginia. Topics included technical and clinical issues relevant to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vertebral fracture assessment, and bone densitometry technologies other than central DXA. This report describes the methodology and presents the results of this PDC. The first ISCD Pediatric PDC was held June 20 to 21, 2007 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and is reported separately.
