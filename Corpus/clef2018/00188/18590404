Craniocervical junction fusions in patients with hindbrain herniation and syringohydromyelia. Patients with hindbrain herniation or the so-called Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) and/or syringohydromyelia are treated with dorsal decompression alone however, a small percentage of patients with other associated abnormalities require concomitant dorsal craniocervical junction (CCJ) fusion. The authors surveyed the indications for CCJ fusions in this population.A retrospective review of University of Iowa medical records and radiographs obtained between 1996 and 2005 was performed. Inclusion criteria encompassed patients with diagnoses of CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia requiring dorsal CCJ fusions, and others with CCJ abnormalities who had CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia.Two hundred thirty-four patients were identified, all of whom were symptomatic at presentation. Their ages ranged from 2.5 to 86 years 33% of the patients were < 16 years of age. Patients were categorized as follows, with some being assigned to > 1 category: Group I, congenital or acquired CCJ abnormalities with reducible bone compression (25% of patients)Dorsal CCJ fusions are required in patients with CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia who have concomitant CCJ abnormalities (Groups I and II). A definite group (CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia) without bone abnormality exists (Groups III and IV). This may be due to muscle weakness secondary to a high syrinx.
