Pathologies of the cervical spine anatomy as a possible cause of young patients vertigo. Vertigo occurs in many diseases, especially in older people. It is a specific diagnostic problem in young people. In the paper, 86 young patients with incidental vertigo were clinically assessed. Electronystagmography, eye-tracking pattern test, optokinetic test and cervical spine X rays were used in examination. The results were compared with the control group of young and healthy people and also with the older patients group with degenerative changes of the cervical spine. In the examined group the disturbances of physiologic cervical lordosis were found in 33.8% and positional nystagmus in 23%. The vestibular tests and hearing were frequently normal. These results suggest that disturbances of physiologic cervical lordosis may be the cause of balance disturbances.
