Injuries to the cervix in sexual trauma. Research on genital injury in sexual assault is limited and few articles have documented injuries to the cervix in sexual assault victims. This review focuses on reviewing and critically evaluating available literature on injuries of the cervix associated with rape, sexual trauma, and some other circumstances. Based on this evaluation, topics for future research are suggested. Nursing and medical studies were examined for this review. The collective studies date from 1991 to 2004. Although multiple articles were identified pertaining to sexual assault and genital injury, only six articles that specifically referred to injuries associated with genital and cervical tissue were included.
