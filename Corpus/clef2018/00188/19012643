Two-year-old boy with cervical and liver abscesses. Pyogenic liver abscesses are rare in children but relatively common in those with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). We present a case of a 2 year old boy who initially presented with BCGitis and Staphylococcus aureus cervical adenitis, and then subsequently developed liver abscesses. A diagnosis of X-linked CGD was confirmed. This case demonstrates the typical radiological features of liver abscesses in CGD, its management without surgical intervention, and the increasingly recognised complications of BCG vaccination in CGD.
