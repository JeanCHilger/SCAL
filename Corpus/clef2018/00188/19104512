ASIA impairment scale conversion in traumatic SCI: is it related with the ability to walk? A descriptive comparison with functional ambulation outcome measures in 273 patients. Prospective multicenter longitudinal cohort study.To determine the relationship between improvements of the American Spinal Injury Association/International Spinal Cord Society (ASIA/ISCoS) neurological standard scale (AIS) outcome measure and improvements of functional ambulatory outcome measures in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).European multicenter study of human SCI (EM-SCI).In 273 eligible patients with traumatic SCI, acute (0-15 days) and chronic phase (6 or 12 months) AIS grades, timed up and go (TUG) test and 10-m walk test (10MWT) outcome measurements were analyzed. Subanalysis of those patients who did have AIS conversion was performed to assess its relation with functional ambulatory outcomes.Studied population consisted of 161 acute phase AIS grade A patients 37 grade BThe AIS conversion outcome measure is poorly related to the ability to walk in traumatic SCI patients. Therefore, the authors recommend the use of functional ambulation recovery outcome measures in prognosticating the recovery of walking capacity and performance of patients with SCI.
