Characteristics of pediatric-onset spinal cord injury. Although children rarely experience spinal cord injuries (SCI), those who do are subject to various lifelong disabilities and morbidities. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively assess the characteristics of pediatric onset SCI patients and their differences among age groups.Clinical characteristics were compared in 48 patients who experienced SCI during childhood and adolescence and who underwent rehabilitation treatment. Clinical characteristics were compared in patients under 4 years old (group A), 4-12 years old (group B), and 13-18 years old (group C) at SCI onset. Radiological findings were compared in 20 patients who were examined on both plain radiograph and computed tomography.The overall male: female ratio was 3:2, with SCI due to non-traumatic causes more frequent overall. Of traumatic causes of SCI, vehicle accident was the most frequent. Of non-traumatic causes, congenital anomaly was most frequent in group A, but tumors became dominant as age increased. Overall, thoracic cord level of injury was most frequent. SCI without radiologic abnormalities (SCIWORA) was predominant in group A, but none was observed in group C. Spinal fractures with or without subluxation accounted for >60% of group C SCI.Non-traumatic, thoracic cord injury was frequent in the pediatric SCI population. SCIWORA was predominant in younger children.
