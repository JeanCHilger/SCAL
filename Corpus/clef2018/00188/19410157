Cervical spine injuries in children: attention to radiographic differences and stability compared to those in the adult patient. The relative rarity of pediatric cervical spine injuries can impede rapid response and efficient care of this patient population. An understanding of the unique anatomical, radiographic, and biomechanical characteristics of the pediatric cervical spine is essential to the appropriate care of these challenging patients. Patterns of injury, diagnosis, and issues related to operative and nonoperative management are discussed with a focus on the developing spine. Our aim is to improve the understanding of traumatic cervical spine injuries in children for all practitioners involved with their care.
