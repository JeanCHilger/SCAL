Blunt trauma to the carotid arteries. Blunt carotid artery trauma is an uncommon but potentially dangerous clinical entity. We report eight patients from a 10-year interval who sustained blunt injuries to the carotid arteries. Six of eight patients suffered a hyperextension injury or had a cervical spine fracture or both. Arteriography revealed four arterial dissections and four thrombotic occlusions. Two asymptomatic common carotid artery occlusions and one dissection with transient ischemic attacks had successful arterial reconstructions. Five patients were treated nonoperatively: three internal carotid artery dissections with minor or no neurologic deficit one asymptomatic thrombosis
