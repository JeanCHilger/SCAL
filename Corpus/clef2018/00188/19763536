Cervical spine osteoblastoma in children: Selective diagnostics as the basis for effective surgical management. Expansively growing cervical spine osteoblastomas are rare but can cause severe neurological damage as a result of their anatomical relationship to nerve structures. Also, cerebral vessels, especially the vertebral artery in its transvertebral position, are often covered by tumor tissue. In complete resection of the tumor, it is sometimes possible to retain the affected vessel. In addition to conventional radiographic diagnostics, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, angiography and Doppler sonography of the intracranial arteries executed in parallel can provide evidence of the dimension of the neurological deficit to be expected during resection. This case report describes the staged diagnostic procedure and successful complete resection, retaining the affected vertebral artery, of an osteoblastoma of the 5th cervical body with massive intraspinal expansion in an 11-year-old child.
