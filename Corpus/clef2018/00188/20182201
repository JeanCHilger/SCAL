Clival epidural hematoma in traumatic sixth cranial nerve palsies combined with cervical injuries. Eight patients sustained a combination of clival epidural hematoma, traumatic sixth cranial nerve palsy (6 NP), and occipitocervical injury. This combination of features has been sparsely described. Whether the hematoma, which represents tectorial membrane injury, is merely a marker for 6 NP and occipitocervical injury or is causative is unresolved, but this imaging finding should alert examiners who note traumatic 6 NP to the need for detailed cervical imaging, as surgical stabilization of this region may be critical to prevent future spinal cord dysfunction.
