Paresis associated with aconuresis caused by intervertebral disc calcification at c7-t1: a case report and review of the literature. Case report.To report a case of a 19-year-old boy with intervertebral disc calcification (IDC) at C7-T1, who presented with paresis and aconuresis. Surgical outcome was assessed.IDC, commonly seen in the cervical spine region in children, is well-known as a self-limiting disorder with no or little symptoms. Surgical intervention is usually not required.A 19-year-old boy presented with acute back pain, progressive numbness, and weakness of both lower extremities and aconuresis for 1 week. There was no traumatic history or signs of infection. Radiograph, computed tomography with reconstruction, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed C7-T1 IDC with severe spinal cord compression. Decompression with anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion was performed.Follow-up showed complete resolution of the back pain and complete recovery of motor power and sensory function in both lower extremities and return of normal micturition function. The patient had full recovery with no complications.Serious neurologic deficit, especially a bladder dysfunction, caused by calcified intervertebral disc is rare. However, favorable outcome can be achieved in those cases where rapid diagnosis is made and followed by spinal cord decompression.
