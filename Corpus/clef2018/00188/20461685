Ectopic thymic tissue presenting as a neck mass in children: a report of 3 cases. The presentation of ectopic cervical thymic tissue as an anterior neck mass is rare. We report 3 similar cases in 3 boys-2 who had a thymic cyst and 1 who had an ectopic cervical thymus. We discuss the radiographic presentation on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in these cases. We also review the typical histologic picture histology is the only way of diagnosing this condition.
