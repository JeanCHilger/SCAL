Magnetic resonance imaging and anatomy of the spine. This article deals with the detailed anatomy of the spine most pertinent to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The cervical and lumbar regions, the pediatric spine, and the intervertebral discs are emphasized. High resolution MR images of cadaver spines obtained from a 1.5 tesla imager were compared with cryomicrotome sections. This correlative study provided meaningful anatomic information for accurately interpreting and better understanding MR images of living patients.
