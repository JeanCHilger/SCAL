Cardiovascular changes in cervical spinal cord lesions. A study is performed on the alterations in blood pressure and heart rate in 36 patients with cervical spinal cord lesions with as evolution of at least 5 years. We have found fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate when passing from lying to standing position, before urinating and from one day to another. The incidence of autonomic dysreflexia crisis is observed in 178 patients suffering cervical spinal cord lesions of the Hospital Nacional de Parapl√©jicos, Toledo. This is a scarcely known entity by physicians in general and the patient's life very often depends on its diagnosis and correct treatment.
