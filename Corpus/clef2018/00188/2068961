Comparative study of different dorsal stabilization techniques in recent thoraco-lumbar spine fractures. The authors initially outline the development of operative techniques to stabilize traumatic thoraco-lumbar spine fractures. Thereafter their own results in 125 patients, treated operatively between 1.1.1983 and 15.9.1988, are presented. The different techniques (Harrington-instrumentation, transpedicular plate stabilization, fixateur interne) are evaluated. In the clinical neurological examination 25% of the patients experienced an improvement by at least one point in the FRANKEL classification. Four patients suffered neurological deterioration. In the radiological follow-up the "Sintering" process, the kyphotic and scoliotic deformity of the spinal segment were measured. The fixateur interne had the best overall results (loss of reposition averaged a kyphosis of 6.8 degrees, no fracture instability). Less good results were obtained with both the Harrington stabilization (loss of reposition 9.1 degrees, fracture instability in 3 cases) and with the transpedicular plate stabilization (loss of reposition 12.4 degrees, fracture instability in 2 cases). Finally the complications are described. The optimal approach is based on the clinical development. The fusion should be as short as possible with a stable angle implant and the possibility to reposition intraoperatively should be given. Postero-lateral spongiosa application, fusion of the vertebral arch joints, diskectomy with transpedicular spongiosa application and intercorporal blocking should be considered.
