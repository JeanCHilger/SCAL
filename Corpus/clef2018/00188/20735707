Contributions from forensic imaging to the investigation of upper cervical fractures. Injuries to the upper cervical spine (UCS) are common in traumatic deaths and postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) may contribute to the forensic investigation. This study presents PMCT in comparison with autopsy in the examination of UCS injury. Thirteen consecutive cases with UCS fracture and ‚ÅÑ or cranio-cervical dislocation were examined with PMCT and autopsy, and the findings were correlated. Neither of the techniques identified all UCS injuries. Fractures of atlas and axis were best visualized with PMCT whereas cranio-cervical dislocation was better identified during autopsy. Serious injuries were present after both high- and low-energy trauma. Medico-legal autopsy in combination with PMCT produced a thorough evaluation of UCS injuries. By combining these procedures detailed investigations, including accident reconstruction and injury pattern analysis, can be performed. This study supports the routine application of PMCT, as a supplement to the medico-legal autopsy of deaths with UCS injuries.
