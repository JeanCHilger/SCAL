A population-based study of all-terrain vehicle-related head and spinal injuries. All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are inherently unstable and their use results in numerous injuries annually in the United States.We evaluated the magnitude of ATV-related head and spinal column injuries in Utah and identified risk factors that might be addressed by preventative measures.Four statewide trauma and hospital databases were queried to obtain data on hospital visits by patients with ATV-related neurological injuries in Utah from 2001 to 2005.Seven hundred forty-one patients (median age, 24 years range, 2-87 years) with ATV-related head and spinal injuries were identified. Five hundred one patients had injuries requiring transport to a hospital, of which 261 required intensive care. Five hundred fifty-nine patients experienced head trauma and 328 patients sustained spinal trauma. The average injury severity score was 12.6 (range, 0-75). Average hospital stay was 4 days (range, 0-34 days). Vehicle rollover was the most common mechanism of injury (28.6%), followed by loss of control and separation of rider and vehicle (20.1%) and collisions with stationary objects (6.1%) or other vehicles (4.1%). Helmet use was inconsistently documented, but patients without helmets were more likely to have a head injury. Injury frequency increased over time, from 116 in 2001 to 174 in 2005.The number of ATV-related head and spinal injuries is increasing in Utah. Serious injuries requiring surgery or intensive care are common. Riders under 20 years of age are especially at risk, and helmet use may decrease the likelihood of admission to the intensive care unit, head injuries, and death.
