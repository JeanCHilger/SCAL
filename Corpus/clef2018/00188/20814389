Imaging of non-traumatic and non-tumoral cord lesions. There is a wide range of spinal cord pathologies (vascular, inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, degenerative). They present clinically as acute partial or complete cord syndromes, or chronic myelopathies (more than 4 weeks in duration). MRI examination should be undertaken with a very strict protocol. Spinal cord lesions should be evaluated with regards to their T1W and T2W signal characteristics, involvement of grey and/or white matter, axial and sagittal extension, cord volume changes, contrast uptake and associated lesions (perimedullary, radicular or brain). The correlation of MR imaging features with clinical and biological data (blood and CSF) should suggest a differential diagnosis.
