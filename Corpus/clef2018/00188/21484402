Fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in childhood and adolescence. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcome after operative treatment of fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in children.Over a period of 10 years, 14 patients (10 girls and 4 boys) with a mean age of 12.6 years were treated operatively. The mean follow-up was 47.4 months. At follow-up range of motion, residual pain, and activities of daily living were considered. Radiological X-rays were performed in anterior and lateral views, and kyphosis deformity as well as reduction of the height were determined.Most fractures were comprehension fractures (71.4%). In 13 patients dorsal decompression and internal fixation was performed. Off the six patients who had neurologic injuries, two had complete return of neurologic function. Five patients had no pain. Radiologically, five patients showed a mean kyphosis deformity of 12.7Â° as well as a mean height reduction of 2.7mm. Ten patients reported no problems in activities of daily living. Overall our patients showed good results in clinical outcome.Those patients who need operative therapy require prompt diagnosis and therapy to minimize permanent damage.
