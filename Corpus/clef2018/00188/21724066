Cervical vertebral column morphology related to craniofacial morphology and head posture in preorthodontic children with Class II malocclusion and horizontal maxillary overjet. In preorthodontic children with Class II malocclusion and horizontal maxillary overjet, cervical column morphology was examined and related to craniofacial morphology and head posture for the first time.Two hundred thirteen children (aged 7-15 years) with a horizontal maxillary overjet of more than 6 mm were divided into 2 groups of skeletal and dentoalveolar overjets. The skeletal overjet group comprised 99 patients (43 girls, 56 boys). The dentoalveolar overjet group comprised 114 subjects (58 girls, 56 boys). Visual assessments of the cervical column and measurements of craniofacial morphology and head posture were made on profile radiographs.Deviations in the cervical vertebral column morphology occurred significantly more often in the skeletal overjet group (28%) compared with the dentoalveolar overjet group (17%) (P <0.05). Fusion anomalies were associated with a large sagittal jaw relationship, retrognathia of the jaws, large inclination of the jaws, and extended head posture (P <0.05 and 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, a partial cleft was significantly associated with a large cranial base angle (P <0.01).New associations were found between cervical column morphology, craniofacial morphology, and head posture in preorthodontic children with horizontal maxillary overjet. These findings are considered important for diagnostics and thus for a more accurate treatment plan of these patients.
