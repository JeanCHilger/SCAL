Effects of burst-type transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cervical range of motion and latent myofascial trigger point pain sensitivity. To assess the effects of a burst application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on cervical range of motion and pressure point sensitivity of latent myofascial trigger points (MTrPs).A single-session, single-blind randomized trial.General community rehabilitation clinic.Individuals (N = 76 45 men, 31 women) aged 18 to 41 years (mean ± SD, 23 ± 4y) with latent MTrPs in 1 upper trapezius muscle.Subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups: a TENS group that received a burst-type TENS (pulse width, 200 μs frequency, 100 HzReferred pressure pain threshold (RPPT) over the MTrP and cervical range of motion in rotation were assessed before, and 1 and 5 minutes after the intervention by an assessor blinded to subjects' treatment.The analysis of covariance revealed a significant group × time interaction (P < .001) for RPPT: the TENS group exhibited a greater increase compared with the control group however, between-group differences were small at 1 minute (0.3 kg/cm²A 10-minute application of burst-type TENS increases in a small but statistically significant manner the RPPT over upper trapezius latent MTrPs and the ipsilateral cervical range of motion.
