Posterior occipitocervical fixation under skull-femoral traction for the treatment of basilar impression in a child with Klippel-Feil syndrome. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with symptoms due to Klippel-Feil syndrome. Radiographs and CT scans demonstrated basilar impression, occipitalisation of C1 and fusion of C2/C3. MRI showed ventral compression of the medullocervical junction. Skull traction was undertaken pre-operatively to determine whether the basilar impression could be safely reduced. During traction, the C3/C4 junction migrated 12 mm caudally and spasticity resolved. Peri-operative skull-femoral traction enabled posterior occipitocervical fixation without decompression. Following surgery, cervical alignment was restored and spasticity remained absent. One year after surgery he was not limited in his activities. The surgical strategy for patients with basilar impression and congenital anomalies remains controversial. The anterior approach with decompression is often recommended for patients with ventral compression of the medullocervical region, but such procedures are technically demanding and carry a significant risk of complications. Our surgical strategy was an alternative solution. Prior to a posterior cervical fixation, without decompression, skull traction was used to confirm that the deformity was reducible and effective in resolving associated myelopathy.
