New directions in cranio-cervico-mandibular cephalometry. A pilot survey has been conducted on a sample of 22 adolescents in order to correlate the cranio-facial morphology and the condylar position with the mandibular posture, cranio-cervical posture and airway adequacy. Cephalograms extended to the cervical column and oblique lateral trans-cranial X-Rays with the standard projection has been adopted. The use of specific cephalometrics parameters allowed to separate the sample in sub-groups with similar variables and to obtain diagnostic indications. The utility of an analysis not only cranio-basal but extended to the cranio-cervical, intercervical, cervico-mandibular and hyoid parameters has been demonstrated.
