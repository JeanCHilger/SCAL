Statistical analysis of RR series variability in spinal cord injured persons. Disabled persons with spinal cord injury are prone to cardiovascular dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Rehabilitation of the disabled person is a critical task as it involves multiple therapies. Physical exercise is an important component of rehabilitation, and depends on cardiovascular health. Reduced RR variability is a marker of poor cardiac health. Time domain RR variability analysis of 38 normal healthy subjects and 20 spinal cord injured subjects has been carried out and compared. In this study, RR intervals were recorded in three different modes or positions: supine, sitting and five-second rhythm respiration. At a time of 150 s RR interval data were acquired in each mode and analysed. Statistical parameters (mean, HR, STD, NN50 and pNN50) were calculated. It was observed that most of the indices were significantly and substantially altered in spinal cord injured persons.
