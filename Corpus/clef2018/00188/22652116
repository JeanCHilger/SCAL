Schistosoma haematobium, a rare aetiology of spinal cord compression. Human schistosomiasis is the second endemic disease after malaria. About 200 millions people are concerned, particularly in Africa, South America and Asia. Schistosomal spinal cord compression is under reported in Africa and not well known. Authors present the case of a 10-year-old boy with no suggestive past-medical story, admitted for spinal cord compression. MRI shows tumor like intra dural lesion. Schistosomal granuloma was found after lesion removal by posterior approach. Treatment was completed by praziquantel. Controversies of the treatment are presented.
