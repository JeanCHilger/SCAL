Spinal cord infarction remote from maximal compression in a patient with Morquio syndrome. Morquio syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis type IV, is a rare enzyme deficiency disorder and results in skeletal dysplasia. Odontoid dysplasia is common among affected patients, resulting in atlantoaxial instability and spinal cord compression. Surgical treatments include decompression and prophylactic fusion, during which intraoperative neuromonitoring is important to alert the surgical team to changes in cord function so that they can prevent or mitigate spinal cord injury. This report describes a 16-year-old girl with Morquio syndrome who developed paraplegia due to thoracic spinal cord infarction during foramen magnum and atlantal decompression. This tragic event demonstrates the following: 1) that patients with Morquio syndrome are at risk for ischemic spinal cord injury at levels remote from areas of maximal anatomical compression while under anesthesia in the prone position, possibly due to impaired cardiac output 2) the significance of absent motor evoked potential responses in the lower limbs with preserved upper-limb responses in an ambulatory patient
