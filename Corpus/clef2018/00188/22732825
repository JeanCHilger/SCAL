Cervical spine injury in the young child. This grand rounds is about the clinical and radiological presentation, treatment and outcome of pediatric cervical spine injury. A 15-month-old girl suffers from a motor vehicle accident and is intubated on-site because of progressive agitation. Whole body trauma CT was read as normal. When sedation was discontinued after 24 h she was found to be tetraplegic below C6 level. MRI shows a total disruption between C6 and C7 that in hindsight was also visible on the initial trauma CT. She was treated surgically by an anterior and posterior reconstruction and was post-operatively treated with a halo vest. Clearing the cervical spine in young children is deceptively difficult. Meticulous review and interpretation of conventional radiographs and CT are important yet MRI should be considered in uncertain cases. Severe ligamentous injury without concomitant bony injury occurs more frequently than in older children and adults, with sometimes devastating consequences.
