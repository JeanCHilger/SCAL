Functional neurological recovery after spinal cord injury is impaired in patients with infections. Infections are a common threat to patients after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, infections might propagate neuronal death, and consequently contribute to the restriction of neurological recovery. We investigated the association of infections (i.e. pneumonia and/or postoperative wound infections) with functional neurological outcome after acute severe traumatic spinal cord injury. We screened data sets of 24 762 patients enrolled in a prospective cohort study (National Spinal Cord Injury Database, Birmingham, AL, USA). Patients were assessed according to the ASIA classification. ASIA impairment scale-classified A and B patients recruited within 24 h post-trauma (n = 1436) were selected as being a major recruitment population for interventional trials. Patients with documented pneumonia and/or postoperative wound infections (n = 581) were compared with control subjects (non-documented infections, n = 855). The functional neurological outcome parameters (i) upward ASIA impairment scale conversions (ii) gain of ASIA motor scores
