Eruption of the permanent maxillary canines in relation to mandibular second molar maturity. To evaluate the timing of spontaneous maxillary canine eruption in relation to stages of mandibular second molar maturation. Potential confounding effects from such factors as age, growth phase, and facial features were also explored.A sample of 106 healthy subjects (48 females and 58 males age range, 9.4-14.3 years) with both permanent maxillary canines during the final phase of intraoral eruption were included. Mandibular second molar maturation (stages E to H) was assessed according to the method of Demirjian. Skeletal maturity was determined using the cervical vertebral maturational (CVM) method. Facial vertical and sagittal relationships were evaluated by recording the Sella-Nasion/mandibular plane (SN/MP) angle and the ANB angle. An ordered multiple logistic regression was run to evaluate adjusted correlation of each parameter with the mandibular second molar maturational stage.Overall, the prevalence of the different second molar maturational stages was 36.8%, 37.8%, and 27.4% for stages E, F and G, respectively. According to the regression model, this relation was not influenced by sex, CVM stage, SN/MP angle, and ANB angle.Irrespective of sex, growth phase, and facial features, the maturational stage of the mandibular second molar may be a reliable indicator for the timing of spontaneous eruption of the maxillary canine.
