Symptomatic epidural compression in infants with neuroblastoma: a single-center experience with 5 cases. Infants affected by neuroblastoma with symptomatic epidural compression require early diagnosis and appropriate treatment to avoid severe late complications. However, no established guidelines are available regarding the optimal treatment of these patients. We describe 5 such infants. The interval between the onset of symptoms and tumor diagnosis was 3 to 8 days in 4/5 cases. None developed paraplegia before or after treatment. Treatment for epidural compression included first-line laminoplasty followed by chemotherapy in 3 patients, and chemotherapy first in the remaining 2. To date, all are alive and none have developed severe complications after a follow-up of 9 to 39 months (median, 20).
