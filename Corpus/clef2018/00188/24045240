Characteristics of cervical computed tomography findings in kawasaki disease: a single-center experience. The objective of this study was to characterize cervical computed tomography (CT) findings in Kawasaki disease (KD) patients that may facilitate early diagnosis.We retrospectively reviewed cervical CT images of 78 children with cervical lymphadenopathy to analyze the distribution and morphology of lymphadenopathy and other soft-tissue findings.Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with KD. Fifty had other diseases (non-KD). Retropharyngeal edema was observed in 82% (23/28) of KD and 30% (15/50) of non-KD (P < 0.01) cases. Retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy was observed in 89% (25/28) of KD and 48% (24/50) of non-KD (P < 0.01) cases. Levels III and IV lymphadenopathy was found in only 1 KD case, whereas levels III and IV lymphadenopathy was found in 58% (29/50) (P < 0.01) and 36% (18/50) (P < 0.01) of non-KD cases, respectively.Retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy and retropharyngeal edema are relatively common features of KD on CT. Given the potentially serious complications of KD, this diagnosis is an important consideration in a young child presenting with these imaging findings.
