Posterior fixation of thoracolumbar burst fractures: is it possible to protect one segment in the lumbar region? The treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures is controversial. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare intermediate-segment (IS) and long-segment (LS) instrumentation in the treatment for these fractures.IS instrumentation was considered as pedicle fixation two levels above and one level below the fractured vertebra (infra-laminar hooks attached to lower vertebra with pedicle screws). LS instrumentation was done two levels above and two levels below the fractured vertebra. Among a total of 25 consecutive patients, Group 1 included ten patients treated by IS pedicle fixation, whereas Group 2 included fifteen patients treated by LS instrumentation.The measurements of local kyphosis (p = 0.955), sagittal index (p = 0.128), anterior vertebral height compression (p = 0.230) and canal diameter expansion (p = 0.839) demonstrated similar improvement at the final follow-up between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between Group 1 and Group 2 regarding clinical outcome [Hannover scoring system, Oswestry disability questionnaire and the range of motion of the lumbar region compared to neutral (0Â°)].The radiographic parameters were the same between the two groups. However, the clinical parameters demonstrated that IS instrumentation is a more effective management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
