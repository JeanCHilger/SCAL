Evaluation and management of pediatric near-hanging injury. Children surviving a strangulation event are unique from adults in that they are at risk for significant airway compromise due to the smaller relative size of their airways. To date, no study has specifically evaluated the laryngeal findings and management of pediatric near-hanging patients.A retrospective chart review was performed on all near-hangings presenting to the a tertiary care children's hospital from January 2001 until June 2010. Demographic information was compiled in addition to laryngeal findings.Sixteen children were identified. Four had a documented laryngeal injury, one of which was a major injury requiring a tracheotomy.Laryngeal examination should be standard of care for any child presenting after a near-hanging event.
