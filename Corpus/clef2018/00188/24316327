Symptoms of depression over time in adults with pediatric-onset spinal cord injury. To investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in adults with pediatric-onset spinal cord injury (SCI) and explore potential risk factors that may be associated with elevated symptoms.Longitudinal, cohort survey over a period of 2 to 9 years. Follow-up occurred approximately every year, a total of 868 interviews were conducted, and most participants contributed to at least 3 waves of data (72% range, 2-8Community.Adults (N=214 133 menNot applicable.Participants completed measures assessing psychosocial functioning, physical independence, participation, and depression at each time point. Multilevel growth modeling analyses were used to explore depression symptoms across time.Depression symptoms at initial status were typically minimal (3.07Â±.24 95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.54) but fluctuated significantly over time (P<.01). Several factors emerged as significant predictors of depressive symptoms in the final model, including less community participation (P<.01), incomplete injury (P=.02), hazardous drinking (P=.02), bladder incontinence (P=.01), and pain (P=.03). Within individuals, as bowel accidents (P<.01) and pain increased (P<.01), depression scores increasedThese findings suggest that most patients with pediatric-onset SCI are psychologically resilient, but strategies to minimize secondary health complications and foster community participation and engagement should be considered.
