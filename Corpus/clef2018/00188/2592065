Radiological assessment of atlanto-axial injuries. Injury to the cervical spine is a potentially lethal condition, and the accurate detection of such injury is essential.

There have been many studies demonstrating unreliability of plain cervical radiography in detecting atlanto-axial injuries. We report a group of patients in which false-positive interpretation of such injuries occurred.
