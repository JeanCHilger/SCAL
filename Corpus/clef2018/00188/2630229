CT myelography with low concentration and/or a low dose of nonionic contrast water-soluble medium. This paper presented the results of CT myelography with a low concentration and/or low dose of nonionic contrast water-solvable medium was used for 170 patients. The results had shown that the micro-structure within the spinal canal was shown clearly, the quality of film screen images were good, the interval between the time of injection and that of scanning was shortened, the scope of plain CT was widened, and its diagnostic accuracy was high. The side effects did occur infrequently and were usually mild in nature.
