Anterior metal plate fixation in the treatment of unstable lower cervical spine injuries. The authors present their experience with the use of anterior metal plate fixation in thirty-seven patients with an unstable lower cervical spine injury. The application of a metal plate was simple and achieved immediate stabilization. This alternative method of internal fixation of the cervical spine allowed early mobilization and avoidance of complications from long-term skeletal traction. It shortened the hospital stay. The purpose of this paper is to describe the principles of this technique and to discuss its indications and applications.
