Magnetic resonance imaging of lipomyelomeningocele and tethered cord. The operative and magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings of 25 patients with the diagnosis of lipomyelomeningocele and/or tethered cord were compared. Postoperative MRI scans of eight patients, five of whom were in stable condition, were also compared with the preoperative studies. In this review there was one false negative MRI scan and four MRI scans in which the relationship of the lipoma to the conus or filum was not demonstrated accurately. In six patients, incidental intramedullary cystic lesions at the conus were identified by MRI scan. All eight postoperative (1 month to 2 years) scans demonstrated no change in the level of the conus from the preoperative study. MRI is an accurate screening modality in the initial diagnosis of occult spinal dysraphism. MRI was not useful in the postoperative evaluation of lipomyelomeningocele and the tethered cord, since the caudal, posterior displacement of the conus was unchanged in all studies.
