Correlation between magnetic resonance imaging and surgical findings in the tethered spinal cord. Between October 1982 and August 1987, 20 patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent surgical release of a tethered spinal cord. The tethering was caused by a thick filum terminale in 6 patients. On MRI scans, the conus medullaris was at L4 in 2 patients, at L2 in 3 patients, and the filum terminale appeared thick in 1 patient. The spinal cord was tethered to an intradural lipoma correctly demonstrated by MRI in 6 patients. Increased epidural fat was misdiagnosed as an intradural lipoma in one patient and a lipomatous stalk was not identified in 2 other patients. Scar tissue resulting from repair of a meningocele had tethered the cord in the remaining 8 patients. On MRI scans, the conus medullaris was located between L3 and S3 in 5 of the patients, scar tissue was apparent on the MRI scan. This correlative study supports the use of MRI as the initial, and possibly the only, imaging modality when a tethered spinal cord is suspected. Improved or more recent MRI techniques will help demonstrate these anomalies better.
