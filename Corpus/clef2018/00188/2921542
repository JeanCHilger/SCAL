Post-traumatic asymptomatic saccular aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. A patient presented with mild upper airway obstruction after being shot from behind through the neck and soft palate. Two days later he developed palsies of the IXth to XIIth cranial nerves inclusive on the traumatised side. These palsies resolved spontaneously after three weeks. Further investigation revealed the presence of a saccular aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The internal carotid artery was ligated after gradual closure for three days using a Preston clamp.
