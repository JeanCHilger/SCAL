Nutritional status during the acute stage of spinal cord injury. This study was designed to help clinicians establish objective guidelines for meeting the nutritional requirements of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients during their initial hospitalizations. The nutritional status of 51 SCI patients treated between 1983 and 1986 was assessed at two, four, and eight weeks after injury. Nutrient deficiencies such as albumin (100% of patients), carotene (62%), transferrin (37%), ascorbate (25%), thiamine (24%), folate (20%), and copper (11%) were documented most frequently at two weeks postinjury. There was an average of 2.0, 1.6, and 1.2 nutrient abnormalities per patient at two, four, and eight weeks postinjury, respectively. Although most depressed nutrient parameters improved with time, diet-dependent plasma proteins such as albumin and transferrin remained low throughout the entire eight-week period. Mean body weight declined 1.3 +/- 3.9 kg during the first two weeks, 2.0 +/- 4.4 kg between two and four weeks, and 0.4 +/- 2.0 kg between four and eight weeks after injury. Significant findings also included a strong correlation between plasma albumin, ascorbate, and carotene levels and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure (p less than .05). Although nutrient status usually improved with time and was not definitely associated with an increased risk of secondary medical complications, prudence dictates that these deficiencies should be prevented by appropriate intervention.
