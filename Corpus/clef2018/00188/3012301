Successful chemotherapeutic decompression of epidural malignant germ cell tumor. A patient with a sacrococcygeal malignant germ cell tumor developed epidural spinal cord compression syndrome 32 days after surgical resection of tumor. Rapid resolution of symptoms was observed after chemotherapy with vinblastine, bleomycin, and cisplatinum. There was no radiation therapy or laminectomy for spinal compression. The patient had an excellent neurological recovery without any sequelae from spinal compression. Chemotherapy alone is an excellent approach to the management of epidural compression by malignant germ tumor.
