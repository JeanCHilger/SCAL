Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation in adults. A preliminary report. In an attempt to assess the value of the Cotrel-Dubousset (CD) system for adult spinal disorders, the first 50 adult cases performed at Johns Hopkins were reviewed. Treatment of adult scoliosis with the CD system yielded results comparable to standard techniques. Curve correction was directly proportional to the preoperative flexibility with no loss of correction in any case. All patients went on to a solid arthrodesis, with only three patients requiring the use of postoperative orthoses. Operative time was initially prolonged during the phase of acquiring expertise with the system however, blood loss and hospitalization were comparable. In both the scoliosis and kyphosis groups instrumentation and fusion incorporated the same number of levels as would have been required for conventional instrumentation systems. In the spondylolisthesis, tumor and trauma groups a total of 88 transpedicle screws was used in 18 patients without neurologic complications. Pedicle screws provided a fixation alternative in cases requiring laminectomies. In the 25 cases with tumors, spondylolisthesis, and trauma, CD instrumentation reduced the number of vertebral levels required for fixation. Compared to Harrington or Luque systems, the average number of motion segments spared per patient was 1.3 in the spondylolisthesis group, 2 in the tumor group and 2.1 in the trauma group. This study suggests that the CD system, although initially developed for idiopathic adolescent scoliosis, is versatile and can be safely and effectively applied to a variety of adult spinal conditions. In cases of spinal pathology due to neoplasm, spondylolisthesis, and trauma, CD instrumentation with the option of transpedicle fixation appeared to offer significant advantages over conventional methods, and an average of 1.6 lumbar motion segments could be preserved per case.
