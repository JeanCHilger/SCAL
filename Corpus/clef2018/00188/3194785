Traumatic rotatory displacement of the lower cervical spine. Traumatic rotatory displacement (TRD) are defined as all slight anterior corporeal displacements (less than 1/3 of the vertebral body) secondary to different vectors, but with a constant and dominant rotatory component. The authors report on 47 cases of TRD (35% of all severe lower cervical spine injuries) (follow-up: 6 months to 7 years). TRD occurs only when two lesions are present: an anterior lesion in the disk and ligaments, and a posterior lesion of the articular process, as the authors confirmed earlier in an experimental study on monkeys and specimens. Depending on the nature of the posterior lesions, three anatomoclinical types occur: 1) posterior capsular lesions cause unilateral facet dislocation (UFD): ten cases 2) bony lesions of the articular process cause unilateral facet fracture (UFF): 28 cases
