An unusual presentation of gluteal hematoma during anticoagulation therapy for deep venous thrombosis in spinal cord injury. Soft tissue bleeding can be manifested clinically by swelling, skin discoloration, pain and tenderness. Early recognition can be difficult in the spinal cord-injured population in whom sensation is impaired. We are presenting a case of occult bleeding into the gluteal region during anticoagulation therapy in a paraplegic patient that presented as migrating pain and tenderness in the hip and pelvic area.
