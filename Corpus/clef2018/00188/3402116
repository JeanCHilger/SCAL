Upper extremity fractures in the acute spinal cord injured patient. Fifty-three long bone upper extremity fractures in 46 patients with recent spinal cord injuries were reviewed with reference to the outcome of operative versus nonoperative treatment. Twenty-four fractures had surgery and 29 fractures were treated nonoperatively. Criteria used in assessing outcome included range of motion, time to union, total rehabilitation time, and orthopedic and medical complications. Humeral fractures had similar outcomes with either operative or nonoperative treatment. Radial nerve injury occurring with humeral fractures prolonged the rehabilitation time. All three combined radial and ulnar fracture treated surgically developed synostosis whereas two of the three nonoperatively treated fractures had other orthopedic complications. Nondisplaced radial fractures responded appropriately to closed treatment. Displaced radial fractures treated nonoperatively had a high incidence of malunion. All ulnar fractures were treated operatively, and all achieved acceptable range of motion and fracture healing at the time of discharge. Medical complications such as deep venous thromboses and decubitus ulcers occurred more frequently in the nonoperatively treated group (28%) than in the operatively treated group (4%). Standard guidelines for upper extremity fracture care apply to the patient with a spinal cord injury. However, operative stabilization may be associated with a decreased risk of medical complications in these patients.
