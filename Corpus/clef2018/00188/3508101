Spinal injury at the level of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae resulting from the axial loading mechanism: an analysis and classification. The traumatic C3-C4 level injuries sustained by young athletes and documented by the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry are discussed. Twenty-eight of 885 (2.8 per cent) injuries involved the C3-C4 vertebrae. Review of these cases reveals that the response to energy inputs at the C3-C4 level differ from that of those involving the upper (C1-C2) and lower (C5-C6) cervical segments. Specifically, these lesions appear unique with regard to infrequency of bony fracture, difficulty in effecting and maintaining reduction, and their more favorable response to early aggressive treatment. It is the authors' belief that these lesions resulting from athletic activity are due to axial loading.
