CT digital radiography: alternative technique for airway evaluation in physically disabled patients. Evaluation of the airway for the presence of granulation tissue prior to removal of a tracheostomy is essential to prevent sudden respiratory decompensation secondary to obstruction. Airway examination in a brain and/or spinal cord injured patient is especially difficult under fluoroscopy. The patient's lack of mobility results in poor visualization of the trachea, secondary to the overlying dense osseous components of the shoulders and thoracic cage. A CT localization view (digital view), which allows manipulation and magnification of the digital data in order to see the hidden airway and detect associated obstructing lesions, is proffered as an alternative technique to high KV, magnification technique. Thirteen examinations were performed satisfactorily in eleven patients examined by this technique with little expenditure of time, physical exertion, and irradiation. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of digital airway examination were 100%, 67% and 92% respectively with bronchoscopy used as the standard.
