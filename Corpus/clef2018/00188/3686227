CT-functional diagnostics of the rotatory instability of the upper cervical spine. Part 2. An evaluation on healthy adults and patients with suspected instability. Nine healthy adults and 43 patients with cervical spine injury were examined by using functional (computerized tomography) CT scanning. The ranges of axial rotation at the levels occiput C0-C1, C1-C2, and C2-C3 were measured. A rotation at C0-C1 greater than 8 degrees at C1-C2, 56 degrees
