Computerized tomography in spinal osteoblastoma. Observations in 10 cases. In order to stress the role of computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of benign spinal osteoblastoma, the authors examined by CT 10 patients with surgically and histologically proved osteoblastomas of the spine. Basing on surgical and histopathological findings CT proved to be a very important method for attesting the presence of the tumors (usually showed by radiographic examination), and specially for their staging and follow-up. CT in fact showed the real extent of the tumor into the spinal canal and towards the paraspinal soft tissues, and allowed the early detection of post surgical relapses. The authors conclude that CT is a primary diagnostic modality for preoperative planning and follow-up of benign osteoblastoma.
