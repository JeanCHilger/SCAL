Pathologico-anatomic studies in the area of the vertebral artery with special reference to perivascular connective tissue. On the basis of pathological-anatomical examinations of 25 human cervical vertebral columns a report is given on changes of the perivascular tissue in the region of the Aa. vertebralis. The possible influence of degenerative changes in the skeleton of the cervical vertebral column on this connective tissue reaction is discussed. For a verification of the findings obtained comparative clinical-anatomical examinations are necessary.
