Vertebral hemangiomas presenting with neurologic symptoms. Six cases of spinal hemangiomas with neurologic symptoms are reported. In three of them the diagnosis was obtained before surgery using plain x-rays and spinal computed tomography scan or biopsy. In the other cases the diagnosis was not done before surgery. In two cases preoperative embolization had minimized blood loss during surgery. Laminectomy was performed in three cases. Large removal and/or vertebrectomy was carried out in the other cases. Our results and a review of the literature about the investigations and treatment of vertebral hemangiomas led us to propose a stereotypical management of spinal hemangiomas with neurologic symptoms.
