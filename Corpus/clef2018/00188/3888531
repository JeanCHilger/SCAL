Prevertebral soft tissue changes in cervical spine injury. Primary radiological diagnostics of cervical spine injuries is difficult. It can be improved by making observations on the signs which indicate a fracture, such as alterations in prevertebral soft tissue structures. Several authors have given different suggestions for normal values of prevertebral soft tissue width. It is influenced by the level of the measurement, the posture of the spine, and the patient's age. The soft tissue changes have been stated to often occur with injuries of the anterior parts of the cervical spine, but also with severe injuries in the upper and posterior parts. However, different authors have reported considerably varying figures of incidence of prevertebral soft tissue widening. The article will deal with these matters it will be based on a material of 165 patients with cervical spine injury, a series of 70 noninjury patients, and the flexion-extension radiograms of the latter group.
