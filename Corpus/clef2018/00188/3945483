Posterior cervical fusion with rigid internal fixation. Rigid fixation of the posterior cervical spine offers definite advantages over conventional wiring techniques. These advantages are emphasized in certain high-risk groups of patients, including those with multiple-level traumatic instability, cervical deformities, and unresectable anterior tumor involvement. Early fusion with minimal external fixation is another important advantage. The focus of this article is the concept of rigid internal fixation of the posterior cervical spine and the application of specific techniques used to achieve this goal.
