Computer tomography in injuries of the cervical vertebrae. 32 patients with traumatic injuries of the cervical spine were investigated by CT. All patients were initially examined by plain films. CT was definitely superior to conventional radiology in compressive fractures of vertebral bodies. In flexion-extension injuries CT was useful showing fractures of the posterior elements in great detail. Conventional tomography was superior to CT in patients with complex dislocations of vertebral bodies. In the absence of fracture CT failed to detect disruptions of ligaments, which were readily shown by functional examination.
