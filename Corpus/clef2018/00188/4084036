Late stability of the cervical spine. Radiological criteria, laid down to detect instability of the cervical spine after cadaveric biomechanical studies, were applied to 52 cases of cervical spine injury. Only one case of instability was detected, and late neurological signs resolved after posterior cervical fusion. Three other cases which fulfilled the radiological criteria of instability clinically were symptom free. It is concluded that these criteria alone cannot establish the indications for surgical intervention.
