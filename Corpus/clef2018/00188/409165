Backward "displacement" of the spinolaminal line at C2: a normal variation. The base of the spinous process of C2 may be "displaced" backward in relation to the other vertebrae in some adult patients examined for reasons other than trauma. In 10.2% of normal children, it was 2-3 mm behind a line joining the base of the spinous process of C3 and the inner side of the posterior arch of the atlas. By recognition of this normal variant, an erroneous diagnosis of subluxation is avoided.
