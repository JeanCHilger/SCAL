On the problem of the "more early" diagnosis of spinal cord tumours in children and infants (author's transl). A report is given on 40 spinal cord tumours in children and infants, the diagnosis of which was considerably delayed in part. 28 children were hospitalised because of fixed paralysis, incomplete or complete compression of spinal cord or cauda. Persisting pain in various sections of the spine, often combined with abnormalities in posture and position are suspicious on tumour as long as another cause is proved. X-ray pictures and analysis of lumbarcerebrospinal fluid are in the most cases of decisive importance for a progressing diagnosis. Myeloscintigraphy is specially useful for an early and exclusing diagnosis.
