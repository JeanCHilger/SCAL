The importance of soft tissues in certain skeletal traumatic lesions. Soft tissue aspects of skeletal trauma are discussed according to two categories: (1) those injuries in which the significance of the soft tissue in the pathophysiology of the skeletal lesion is indicated by the characteristics of the skeletal injury (such as extension teardrop fracture, little leaguer's elbow, "baseball fracture," and Bennett's fracture) and (2) those injuries in which the associated soft tissue injury, or complication, may be reasonably inferred by the location and nature of the skeletal injury (such as major facial fractures, posterior sternoclavicular dislocations, fractures of the lower rib and lumbar transverse processes, and pelvic disruptions).
