Extradural lipomatosis simulating an acute herniated nucleus pulposus. Case report. A 48-year-old laborer presented with a 1-year history of low-back pain radiating into the posterior aspects of both thighs. Two weeks before admission, acute exacerbation resulted in signs and symptoms of compressive radiculopathy at L-5. Myelography revealed concentric constriction of the lower thecal sac due to abundant fat, as shown by computerized tomography. Laminectomy produced immediate relief of pain. The significance of these findings and a review of the literature are presented.
