The influence of thin-section tomography on the treatment of cervical spine injuries. A study was performed to determine the influence of routine thin-section tomography on subsequent treatment of the patient with acute trauma to the cervical spine. Of 79 such patients who underwent tomography over a 14-month period, 55 had suspicious indirect findings on the radiograph and 25% of these were shown to have fractures, while 67% of the patients without radiographic abnormalities who presented with a neurological deficit also demonstrated fractures on tomography. Of the patients who were shown to have fractures prior to tomography, 54% had more extensive injury than originally suspected. In nearly 18% of patients, the mode of therapy was changed significantly after tomographic evaluation. Indications for tomography are discussed and specific recommendations for systematic radiographic evaluation of cervical spine injuries are presented.
