Compressive myelopathy associated with type VI mucopolysaccharidosis (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome). Spinal cord compression with resultant myelopathy is a frequent occurrence in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses. Etiological factors include developmental abnormalities of the cervical spine and infiltration of the dura mater by the accumulated products of mucopolyssacharide metabolism. Compression at the thoracolumbar junction is rare, but was found in a child with the characteristic physical and biochemical stigmata of the Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis VI). An anterolateral approach to remove the compressing bony elements resulted in symptomatic improvement. Careful radiological evaluation is required so that all surgical options can be considered. Patients with metabolic storage diseases and the capacity for normal intellectual function warrant aggressive surgical care to optimize neurological function.
