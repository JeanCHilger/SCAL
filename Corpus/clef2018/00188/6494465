Chordomas: their CT appearance in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. We reviewed 25 CT scans of 21 patients who had chordomas in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. Nine patients were studied at the time of initial presentation and 12 after tumor recurrence. All scans showed vertebral body destruction coupled with an associated soft tissue mass located anteriorly or laterally. Additional CT findings included septated areas of low attenuation within the tumor, amorphous soft tissue calcification, tumor extension into the spinal canal, disk space involvement, and contrast enhancement.
