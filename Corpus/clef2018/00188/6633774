Solitary chondromas and osteochondromas of the spine provoking myeloradicular compression. Apropos of 6 cases treated surgically. 3 spinal chondromas and 3 spinal osteochondromas are described and the relevant literature is reviewed. These oncotypes may remain symptomless or may present as a hard paravertebral swelling or with pain or, more rarely, with a slowly-developing neurological syndrome. Chondromas may appear et any age whereas osteochondromas are more likely to occur during the age of skeletal growth. Both have a predilection for males. Standard Xrays may be diagnostic in osteochondromas but do not always visualise chondromas, which may simulate malignant osteolytic lesions or giant cell tumors and their variants. Computed tomography is indispensable for defining the size of the lesion and its relationships with surrounding structures, for planning surgical treatment, and for following-up its evolution. For both oncotypes treatment is surgical. Recurrence is very rare even after subtotal removal. Malignant degeneration is likewise rare. Operative mortality is nil and neurological recovery is the rule.
