Spinal cord transection, cerebral ischaemic and brain-stem injury in a baby following a Kielland's forceps rotation. A full-term infant suffered a high cervical cord transection after a Kielland 's forceps rotation and extraction. Quadriplegia developed immediately and initial cerebral swelling was followed by atrophy with ventricular dilatation on CT examination. Death occurred at 60 days. At post-mortem complete necrosis of the cervical cord at C2-C3 with old haemorrhage in the meninges was found, with damage to the inferior corpora quadrigemina , the thalamus, striatum, cerebellar and cerebral cortex. The mechanism is discussed briefly.
