Pediatric trauma: an algorithm for diagnosis and therapy. Management of the pediatric patient sustaining a traumatic injury is influenced by patient size, surface area to body mass ratio, thermoregulation, and fluid requirements. A predetermined and systematic approach to the injured child guarantees recognition of life-threatening injuries and provides a method for rapid stabilization. The algorithm is divided into two distinct phases: life support and post-stabilization. The unique aspects of care of the injured child are highlighted to emphasize the significant differences in resuscitation and diagnosis from that of the adult patient.
