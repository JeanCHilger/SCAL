Incidence of Scheuermann's disease. Preliminary report. This is a report on a study of 96 students aged 17 and 18 at two of our local schools. Each student completed a questionnaire, underwent a simple examination of the spine and a measurement of the passive stretch in the hamstring muscles, and had a lateral X-ray of the dorsal and upper lumbar spine. An overall X-ray evidence of Scheuermann's Disease was detected in 60% of males and 23% of females. The possible significance of these results is discussed.
