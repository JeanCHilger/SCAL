Computed tomography of the spine and spinal cord limitations and applications. The author presents a comprehensive review of the literature on spinal computerized tomography in the evaluation of spinal fractures and fracture-dislocations, degenerative processes with bony encroachment into the spinal canal, disc protrusion, cystic degeneration of the cord, communicating hydro-syringomyelia, intra- and extramedullary neoplasms and congenital malformations. Critical analysis of all published data and additional personal experience gained over the past three years make it possible to better define the clinical applications and practical limitations of spinal CT scans.
