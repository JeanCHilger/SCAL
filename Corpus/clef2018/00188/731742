Vertebral column injuries associated with tobogganing. Twenty-four cases of vertebral column injuries associated with tobogganing accidents are presented. The position assumed by the participants increased flexion of the vertebral column, therefore enhancing the possibility of injury to the spine, especially at the mobile thoracolumbar junction. The importance of a thorough examination in evaluating these patients is emphasized as not all injuries are benign. We urge safer and better organization of tobogganing facilities. Two case reports, one a burst fracture of L1 with neurologic involvement and the second, a traumatic spondylolisthesis of L1, are presented in detail.
