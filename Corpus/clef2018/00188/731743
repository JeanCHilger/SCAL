Spinal injuries in child abuse: case report. Injuries of the spine have been seen in cases of child abuse. These injuries can be identified by careful skeletal survey. In the case described, a young boy was originally diagnosed as having dorsolumbar kyphus with no previous trauma, but the injury was later found to be related to parental abuse. The most important condition to rule out is spinal infection. The parental behavioral history is important, and social work consultation is recommended.
