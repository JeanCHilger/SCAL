Prevertebral shadow in cervical trauma. The width of the cervical prevertebral shadow was compared in two groups of patients--24 with definite traumatic lesions and 66 with no history of trauma. A statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups. Measurement of the prevertebral shadow is a good diagnostic procedure, particularly in patients with a doubtful organic traumatic lesion, such as those with a history of whiplash injury.
