The long neck. Lateral x-rays of the cervical spine showed more than seven vertebrae above the clavicle in 65 cases. Comparison with "short-necked" individuals, where the corresponding number of vertebrae was seven of less, revealed a much lower incidence of arthrosis in the long-necked individuals. Neurovascular examination revealed no significant differences between the two groups. The increased incidence of arthrotic changes in the short-necked individuals could be related to the repartition of an equal range of cervical mobility between a smaller number of articulations.
