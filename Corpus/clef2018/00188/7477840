CT and MRI of the normal and diseased perivertebral space. The perivertebral space is in the midline, in the deep tissues of the neck, and can be identified from the skull base above to the mediastinum below. It is a discrete space completely enclosed by the deep layer of deep cervical fascia. The fascial attachments of the perivertebral space divide it into two areas, the anterior prevertebral and posterior paraspinal portions. We made a retrospective analysis of the radiologic and clinical records of 52 patients with lesions in the perivertebral space, to identify the imaging features that mark a lesion as originating in the perivertebral space and define the spectrum of pathology which occurs in the space. Mass lesions present in the prevertebral or paraspinal portions. In the former they usually involve the vertebral body, displacing the prevertebral muscles anteriorly. Epidural extension from lesions in the perivertebral space proper is common. Masses in the paraspinal perivertebral space usually displace the paraspinal muscles away from the spine. We found 9 inflammatory lesions, 29 malignant and 6 benign tumors, and 8 miscellaneous lesions.
