Gastroesophageal reflux in association with the Sandifer syndrome. Eight children presenting with the Sandifer syndrome (with neck contorsion, radiologic studies of the cervical spine and normal neurologic exploration) have been studied in relation to gastro-esophageal reflux (GER). In the eight cases barium swallow, 24 h pH-metering, manometry, endoscopy and biopsy were made, presenting pathological GER. The barium swallow was pathologic in 62% of them. The pH-metering in 37%. The lower esophageal sphincter pressures were decreased in 37%, with esophageal motility alteration in 75%. Signs of macro and/or microscopic esophagitis were found in 62%. Three patients received surgical treatment and the rest medical treatment, with improvement of the neck contorsion in all cases. We have attempted to evaluate which one of the functional explorations for the GER diagnosis is better in this kind of patients, and we have demonstrated that the most frequently found alteration is the esophageal dysmotility.
