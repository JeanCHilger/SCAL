Lateral retrovascular approach to the upper cervical spine. The authors describe the surgical anatomy of lateral approach to the upper cervical spine. The approach is retrovascular retropharyngeal extraoral allowing for anterolateral exposure of the upper cervical column, and it may be enlarged posteriorly on the homolateral posterior hemiarch of C1 and C2, and/or inferiorly on the lower cervical column. Absolute indications to this approach are anterolateral fusion with transarticular screws C1-C2 and excision of skeletal neoplasms adjacent to the vertebral artery. For other indications such as the treatment of anterior neoplasms and spinal cord decompression it is preferable to use pre-vascular extraoral approach or transoral approach.
