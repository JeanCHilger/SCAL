Segmental muscular atrophy of unilateral upper limb associated with cervical disc herniation in a juvenile male. A 25-year-old man first noticed atrophy of right upper arm at the age of 15. This symptom progressed for the following 3 years and then became stable. As he noted difficulty in elevating his right arm above the shoulder level, at the age of 25 he was admitted to our hospital. On neurological examination, he had right scapula alata, moderate atrophy and weakness of right triceps muscle. Right triceps reflex was absent. Other neurological examinations were normal. Needle electromyography revealed neurogenic patterns in the muscles of the C5-T1 segments. Cervical MRI and CT myelography revealed mild cervical disc protrusion toward the right side at the C5/6 level and atrophy of the middle and lower cervical cord on the right side, but nothing suggestive of the fexion myelopathy. The clinical manifestations of the patient resembled those of Hirayama disease, except for the distribution of the involved muscles. Since the most severely involved level of the cervical cord (C7 segment) corresponded to the level of the protruded cervical disc, it was suggested that the cervical disc herniation played an important role in the development of the myelopathy in this patient.
