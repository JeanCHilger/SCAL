Three cases of thoracic spina fracture with displacement without spinal cord injury. Three cases of extremely rare, thoracic spine displaced fractures without injury of the spinal cord are reported. An attempt to reconstruct injury mechanism and pathology of the fracture has been undertaken on the basis of radiographs analysis. Immobilisation treatment with no reduction yielded good results. The authors are convinced that this paper, if studied, will indicate the management of this type of injury to those come across it for the first time.
