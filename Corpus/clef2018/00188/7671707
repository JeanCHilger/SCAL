Post-traumatic epidural and subdural hematomas of the spinal cord in MR imaging. Diagnostics of epi- and subdural haematomas of the spinal cord is discussed on the basis of 1992 records of Konstancin Rehabilitation Center. Fifty-four patients with symptoms of partial or complete cord injury were submitted to MR imaging. In four cases (7.5 per cent) epi- or subdural haematoma was found to contribute to neurological condition of the patient. MRI determines indications for surgical intervention.
