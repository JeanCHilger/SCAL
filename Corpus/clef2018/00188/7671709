Sequelae of traumatic injury to the cervical spine treated conservatively. A series of 37 patients with traumatic cervical spine injury has been examined 2 years after the accident on the average. Clinical assessment was followed by taking stress radiographs in functional positions. Redislocations, axial deformities and instability at the site of the injury have been found in 21 patients. Instability was caused by scarification and destruction of the injured disc. Secondary displacements occurred after vertebral dislocation or subluxation and axial deformities usually after crush fracture. Instability due to the ligamentous injury within rear column of the spine and partial disc injury was most frequently observed in young patients with general joint laxity.
