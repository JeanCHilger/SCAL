Clinical experiences and results of high-dosage methylprednisolone therapy in spinal cord trauma 1991 to 1993. Studies in animals and especially the NASCIS II study illustrated the neuroprotective effects of methylprednisolone, but they are disputed. At the University Clinic of Traumatology, Vienna, 31 patients with spinal cord injuries were given methylprednisolone as a bolus of 30 mg/kg body weight followed by a maintenance dose of 5.4 mg/kg body weight/h for another 23 hours. Twenty-seven patients were stabilised within 8 hours, 2 patients were not operated on, because of their low prognosis. Two patients could be treated conservatively, because the spinal fractures were supposed to be stabile. Then follow-up studies of these patients were between 1 and 3.2 years. All patients (100%) with incomplete neurologic deficits (n = 18) showed a significant recovery and even 3 patients (23.1%) with primarily a complete tetraplegia (n = 13) showed a nearly entire recovery. Compared to these results we look back at 113 patients with complete and incomplete neurologic deficits who were treated at the I. University Clinic of Traumatology, Vienna, and would have got methylprednisolone following our current management procedures.
