Clinical application of computed radiography in orthopedic surgery. Since 1988, Fuji Computed Radiography (FCR) system (Fuji Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) has been used at Osaka Prefectural Hospital (Osaka, Japan) for all kinds of images. In this paper, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of computed radiography (CR) images from the standpoint of an orthopedic surgeon. Contours, which can not be seen on conventional radiographs, are clearly visualized on the CR image. Adequate information for diagnosis can be obtained with a great reduction in x-ray exposure during the screening of scoliosis or congenital dislocation of hip joint. However, because the scale is reduced by one half in antero-posterior views of the bilateral hip joint, CR images are unsuitable for postoperative measurement of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Furthermore, caution is required because the clear zone after THA is emphasized on edge-enhanced CR image.
