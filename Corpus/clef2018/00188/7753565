Associations between serum lipids and indicators of adiposity in men with spinal cord injury. Several reports indicate that dyslipidemia, primarily depressed high density lipoprotein cholesterol, is common in persons with spinal cord injury. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between anthropometric and near infrared interactance measurements to the serum lipoprotein profiles of 46 men with spinal cord injury of > 6 months duration. Mean age (+/- SD) was 49.5 +/- 15.0 y and duration of injury was 17.5 +/- 13.0 y. Forty-one percent of the subjects had low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (< 35 mg dl-1) and 57% had elevated total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (> 4.5). Abdominal circumference was most closely associated with the overall lipid profile and abdominal circumference/height ratio was the second strongest correlate. Body mass index, conicity index, and percent body fat estimated by near infrared interactance were significantly related to some lipid parameters however, the relationships were weaker than for abdominal circumference or abdominal circumference/height. Significant correlations were found between abdominal circumference and serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.421, P < 0.01) and log10 triglyceride (r = 0.587, P < 0.001) concentrations as well as the total cholesterol:high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.482, P < 0.01) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.387, P < 0.05) ratios. Based on these findings, the sample was partitioned by abdominal circumference into low (< 95 cm), moderate, and high (> or = 102 cm) risk subgroups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
