Intraspinal metastasis of stage I anaplastic Wilms tumor. Intraspinal metastasis of Wilms' tumors is a rare event with only 6 cases documented in the literature.We report a case of an intraspinal metastasis by a young child with anaplastic Wilms' tumor (stage I). A 9-year-old girl developed 8 months following nephrectomy and pre-operative chemotherapy strong back pain. Within 2 weeks signs of beginning of spinal cord compression were obtained. The magnetic resonance imaging showed a spinal cord compression with an intraspinal tumor mass Th 8 to 10.The child underwent immediate spinal cord decompression followed by chemotherapy and an additional radiotherapy of the metastatic region up to 30 Gy with most of neurologic recovery within 6 weeks.The case illustrates the importance of rapidly responding neurologic complications in patients with Wilms' tumor, even in stage I.
