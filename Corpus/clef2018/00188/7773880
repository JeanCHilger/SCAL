Radiological evaluation of the craniocervical junction in bone dysplasias and other related syndromes. The craniocervical junction, a vital but anatomically complex region, presents additional interpretative challenges in patients with skeletal dysplasias and other syndromes involving the musculoskeletal apparatus.

The 28 cases thus found were reviewed and the different diagnostic modalities identified
