Severe cervical kyphotic deformities in patients with plexiform neurofibromas: case report. Two patients with cervical plexiform neurofibromas are presented. Each of these patients had severe cervical kyphosis and has undergone anterior decompression, anterior reconstruction, and posterior stabilization. We discuss the surgical management of cervical kyphotic deformities associated with plexiform neurofibromas and review the factors associated with bony changes in neurofibromatosis.
