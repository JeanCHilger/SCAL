Epidemiology, treatment and long-term results of spinal fractures at a non-university affiliated central hospital with special reference to fractures of the lumbar spine. In a retrospective study epidemiology, treatment, clinical and radiological results of 283 patients with spine fractures in a five-year period are presented. The operation rate ranges from 42% of the cervical to 9% of the thoracical and 24% of the lumbar spine. We found good radiological results concerning the correction of the wedge compression and the collapse of the lumbar vertebral body by fixation with an internal fixator. After a follow-up of 2-5 years nearly 80% of conservative as well as operative treated patients had more or less residual back pain. Because there is a correlation between the quantity of pain and the radiological dislocation, exact initial diagnosis, without overlooking an instability, and adequate conservative or operative treatment is very important.
