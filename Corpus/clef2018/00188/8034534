Patient management in polytrauma with injuries of the cervical spine. Complex unstable cervical spine injuries in polytraumatized patients are stabilized ventro-dorsally in a two-stage procedure. The ventral stabilization is a day-one surgery with the goal to get primary stability for intensive care, early spinal decompression and protection against secondary damage of the spinal cord. The additional dorsal stabilization allows early functional treatment or in case of spinal cord lesions early neurorehabilitation. The combination of severe brain injury and unstable cervical spine injury is especially demanding concerning diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
