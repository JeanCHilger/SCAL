Cervical intraspinal lipoma in a pregnant patient. Tetraparesis developing in a female, during pregnancy, was found to be due to an intradural cervical lipoma, associated with a subcutaneous lipoma at the same level in the midline posteriorly. Sub-total removal produced a return to near normal function with the patient being fully ambulant 7 months later.
