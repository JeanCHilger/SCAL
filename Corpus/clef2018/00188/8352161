CT in penetrating craniocervical injury by wooden foreign bodies: reminder of a pitfall. The authors report three cases of penetrating craniocervical injury by wooden foreign bodies, which were initially hypodense on CT and thought to be air. When these structures were scrutinized with higher window settings, they had a higher attenuation and a unique striated internal architecture which the authors propose may be specific to wood.
