Results of dorsal pelvic ring stabilization. Complete disruptions of the posterior pelvic ring are rotationally and vertically unstable [type C according to the Tile/AO (ASIF) classification (1991)]. Usually operative treatment is required. The data on 24 patients over a 5-year period were analyzed. Thirteen patients were female (54.2%) and 11 male (45.8%) the average age was 32.8 years. Multiple trauma was present in 20 patients (83.3%). In most cases operative stabilization of the posterior pelvic ring was performed by lag screws from the ilium into the body of the sacrum. The mortality in this series was 16.7% (4 patients). One patient had a thrombosis of the femoral and pelvic veins. In 2 patients we had to perform a second operative procedure because of lag screws that had not been precisely placed or had dislocated. Two incisions healed secondarily. On the postoperative radiographs in 3 patients a slight deformity of the pelvic ring was visible
