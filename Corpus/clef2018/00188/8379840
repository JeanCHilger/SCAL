Magnetic resonance imaging related to neurologic outcome in cervical spinal cord injury. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the initial intramedullary hemorrhage, as seen by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the neurologic deficit and eventual neurologic outcome of acute cervical spinal cord injured subjects. MRI and motor assessments were performed on 24 subjects with motor complete (Frankel A & B) and incomplete (Frankel C & D) injuries. Recovery was determined by evaluating an initial and a final motor power following spinal cord injury (SCI), as defined by the manual muscle test (grade 1-5) and motor index score (MIS). Results showed that all 15 subjects having hemorrhage had motor complete injuries (Frankel A & B). Sixteen percent of the muscles in the upper extremities and 3% of the muscles in the lower extremities in these 15 subjects improved to a grade of > or = 3/5 at the final evaluation post-SCI. In comparison, of the nine subjects not having hemorrhage, eight had motor incomplete injuries (Frankel C & D) and had 73% and 74% of muscles improving in the upper and lower extremities, respectively. In addition, a change in MIS from initial to final evaluations showed a significant difference between subjects with hemorrhage and subjects without hemorrhage (upper extremities: p = .002 and lower extremities: p = .0001). In conclusion, the initial MR image and neurologic assessment correlated with motor power recovery.
