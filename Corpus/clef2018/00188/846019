The risk of neurologic damage with fractures of the vertebrae. The incidence of spinal cord injury with spine fractures and dislocations is approximately 14% of the total as ascertained from a survey of these injuries in Northern California, and 17% of traumatic spinal cord injuries gave no overt radiographic evidence of vertebral injury. Patients sustaining fractures of the vertebral bodies and posterior elements with some degree of malalignment of the spine had a 61% incidence of neurologic deficit. Injuries to the cervical spine most often produced neurologic damage, the incidence of neurologic deficit being 39%. Motor vehicle collisons continue to be the major cause of these injuries and the victim is usually a young adult male.
