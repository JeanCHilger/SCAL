Central cord syndrome secondary to hyperflexion injury of the cervical spine in a child. A 10-year-old girl sustained hyperflexion injury to the midcervical spine, i.e., wedge compression fractures of the C3, C4, and C5 vertebral bodies, when hit by an automobile, subsequently manifesting central cord syndrome below the C4 spinal cord level. Serial magnetic resonance imaging helped identify the spinal cord lesion at the corresponding levels. Conservative management combined with corticosteroid administration resulted in nearly full neurologic recovery approximately 3 months after the trauma, although a cystic lesion remained present within the spinal cord 11 months after trauma.
