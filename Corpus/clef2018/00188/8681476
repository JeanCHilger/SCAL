Craniospinal and spinal enterogenous cysts--report of three cases. We report three cases of enterogenous cyst, one craniospinal and two spinal manifesting with features of spinal cord compression. In one the cyst was intramedullary in location and in the other two it was intradural, extramedullary. The unusual clinical presentation, location and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics are discussed. None of the three patients had any vertebral anomaly or other congenital malformation. All patients had excellent outcome following surgery.
