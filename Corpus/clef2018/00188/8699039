Frequency of cervical spine involvement in rheumatoid arthritis. The cervical spine x-rays of a random number of patients with confirmed rheumatoid arthritis were taken. The presence of atlanto-axial subluxation, atlanto-axial impaction, subaxial subluxation and any other associated abnormalities was noted. The spinal canal diameter was also measured which was not significantly altered in rheumatoid arthritis cases. Cervical spine disorders were seen to occur in 16 cases (69.6%) out of 23 patients. Spondylosis was the most frequent disorder ie, in 10 cases (62.5%) out of 16. Obliteration of the normal lordotic curve and disc lesions occurred in 3 cases (18.7%) each out of 16. The mean spinal canal diameter was 16.30 +/- 2 mm with a range of 13-23 mm. Female patients (73.3%) had an increased cervical spine disorder than males (62.5%). Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis cases (87.5%) were mostly involved in occurrence of disorder than those of seronegative arthritis cases (46%).
