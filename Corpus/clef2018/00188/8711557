Tuberculosis of the cervical spine. Tuberculosis of the cervical spine is rare, comprising 3-5% of cases of tuberculosis of the spine. Eight patients with tuberculosis of the cervical spine seen during 1989-1992 were reviewed. They all presented with neck pain. The 4 children presented with a kyphotic deformity. In all the children the disease was extensive, with a large prevertebral abscess formation, while in the adults it was localised to one or two motion segments. Cord compression was present in 4 of the 8 patients. All the patients were treated with antituberculosis drugs and 6 underwent surgery. There was full neurological recovery in all patients. The kyphosis was improved though not fully corrected. There was a problem in stabilisation of severe involvement of the body and dens of C2. Surgery seems to play a major role in the treatment of tuberculosis of the cervical spine.
