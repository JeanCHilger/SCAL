Retroperitoneal pseudomeningocele complicated by meningitis following a lumbar burst fracture. A case report. This case report demonstrates an unusual complication after anterior decompression and fusion of a lumbar burst fracture.The treatment of this patient involved placement of a computed tomography-guided percutaneous drain and intravenous antibiotics to treat an infected retroperitoneal pseudomeningocele.A case of an anterior retroperitoneal pseudomeningocele complicated by meningitis is presented. This pseudomeningocele occurred in a patient after an L3 burst fracture associated with a dural laceration.The patient was admitted to the authors' trauma unit after a motor vehicle accident with an acute L3 fracture associated with incomplete paraplegia. He underwent an urgent anterior corpectomy, strut grafting, and instrumentation. At surgery, he was noted to have a large anterior dural laceration. After surgery, a large retroperitoneal pseudomeningocele developed that became infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis.After placement of a computed tomography-guided percutaneous drain and intravenous antibiotics, the pseudomeningocele resolved. His anterior fusion healed uneventfully and his neurologic deficit improved dramatically.A case of an anterior retroperitoneal pseudomeningocele complicated by meningitis is presented. This pseudomeningocele occurred in a patient after an L3 burst fracture associated with a dural laceration. The patient was treated successfully with computed tomography-guided percutaneous drain placement and intravenous antibiotics. He made an excellent functional recovery after a severe neurologic injury.
