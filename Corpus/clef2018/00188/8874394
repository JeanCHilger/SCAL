Behavior of the H-reflex in humans following mechanical perturbation or injury to rostral spinal cord. In humans H-reflexes are suppressed during early spinal shock. In animals rostral cord injury results in loss of segmental reflexes within seconds. If H-reflexes persist under general anesthesia, can they be used to monitor the integrity of the rostral cord? In part I of this study, we recorded H-reflexes intraoperatively in 25 patients to elucidate general anesthesia effect. In 23 subjects, H-reflexes were consistently elicited, and within +/- 13% of the normalized group mean amplitude. In part II, we recorded H-reflexes in 31 patients during spinal cord surgery to elucidate H-reflex behavior immediately following rostral spinal cord injury. In 6, abrupt suppression of the H-reflex coincided with cord injury. In 4 of 6, suppression was transient and less than 50% of baseline none of these patients developed neurological deficits. In 2, suppression exceeded 90% and persisted throughout surgery
