Treatment of mentosternal contractures by flap-plasty. Mentosternal contractures still represent a surgical challenge due to their exposed location. They require early operative treatment for both functional as well as aesthetic reasons. Careful clinical examination of scar location and traction forces both in the resting and functional, moving state including proper evaluation of the surrounding soft tissue is mandatory for exact preoperative planning of the reconstructive surgical procedure required. In general, the technically most feasible operation is favoured, if functional and aesthetic results are good and the postoperative risk of recurrent mentosternal contractures is low. Between 1987 and 1994, 21 patients with cervical, mentosternal and mentothoracic contractures underwent operative procedures at our clinic. Eight patients underwent a surgical reconstruction with local flaps and 13 patients received a free microvascularized flap.
