Malignant epidural cord compression. Malignant epidural spinal cord compression (MSCC) may appear in 5-10% of adults and 3-5% of children with active malignant disease. Early diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent irreversible neurological damage below the level of cord compression. Unfortunately such procedures are often subjected to patient and/or doctor delay, when the emergency nature of MSCC is not understood. 3 women and 2 men, aged 17-74, are described, who illustrate both the variability of the presentation of MSCC and of its clinical course, and also problems related to imaging studies necessary to reach appropriate therapeutic decisions. These cases should increase physicians' awareness of the necessity for its early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, it is suggested that a multidisciplinary team approach be followed when MSCC is suspected (in accord with flow chart in Hebrew text).
