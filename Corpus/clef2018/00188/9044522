Acute acalculous cholecystitis in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is a very serious complication which can be found in patients with multiple serious traumatic lesions ('polytrauma'). Very few patients have been reported in the literature with an acute spinal injury and associated AAC. We report seven patients with polytrauma and acute spinal cord injury who developed AAC. All had no complaint of the principal warning symptom: right upper quadrant abdominal pain. All presented with a palpable mass in this site and the laboratory results were compatible with cholestasis. The diagnosis of AAC was confirmed both by ultra sound and CT scanning. We discuss the possible precipitating factors and the treatment. One hundred and ninety one patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in our Hospital with SCI over a period of 2 years, all of these in the acute stage. AAC was diagnosed in seven patients among them. Our purpose is to call attention to this clinical condition which can complicate the outcome of patients with multiple trauma and acute spinal cord injury. To date AAC in this group of patients has been infrequently described in the available literature.
