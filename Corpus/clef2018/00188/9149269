Spinal extradural leiomyoma in a pediatric patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: case report. We report a case of two separate cervicothoracic, extradural leiomyomas occurring in a male pediatric patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). To our knowledge, such a case has never been reported in the literature.A 9-year-old male patient with AIDS presented with progressive leg weakness. At examination, he was myelopathic with paraparesis and a T4 sensory level to pinprick. A magnetic resonance image revealed two separate cervicothoracic lesions causing cord compression.The patient underwent resection of both lesions. Postoperatively, he regained normal strength in his legs and was discharged home after 2 weeks.With the ever-growing number of pediatric patients with AIDS, the entity will likely be encountered with increasing frequency in the future. Because of the potential for neurological recovery and cure, the neurosurgeon should be cognizant of this entity.
