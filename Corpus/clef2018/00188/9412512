Development of walking, swimming and neuronal connections after complete spinal cord transection in the neonatal opossum, Monodelphis domestica. Development of coordinated movements was quantitatively assessed in adult opossums (Monodelphis domestica) with thoracic spinal cords transected by (1) crushing 7-8 d after birth [postnatal days 7-8 (P7-P8)] at 2-3 years of age, systematic behavioral tests (e.g., climbing, footprint analysis, and swimming) showed only minor differences between control (n = 5) and operated (n = 10) animals
