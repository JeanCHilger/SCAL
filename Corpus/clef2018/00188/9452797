Anterior approach of cervical spine in Pott's disease. Apropos of 7 cases. This study reports 7 cases of cervical Pott's disease, gathered during 6 years in the department of neuro-surgery of Ibn Rochd U.H.C. 4 females and 3 males, aged between 9 and 52 years were included. All the patients complained of cervicobrachial pain and weakness of the limbs. Clinical features were: deterioration of general status, rachidian syndrome and neurological impairement with motor and sensitive deficit. Radiological analysis found a destructive and extensive lesion, cervical kyphosis from 10 degrees to 60 degrees, retropharyngeal abscess and intraspinal canal extension of infection. Diagnosis was confirmed by histological study in all cases. In addition to antituberculous therapy and preoperative cervical traction in 4 cases, all the patients had spinal fusion using an anterior approach. Post operative immobilization in a cervical collar varied from 9 to 12 months. All 7 patients had full neurological recovery, 6 patients had an excellent bony fusion and cervical kyphosis was corrected. For the remaining patient, the bone graft was mobilized without neurological disorders. This study confirms anterior arthrodesis efficiency. This procedure in conjunction with preoperative traction, allowed stabilization of the spine and healing of vertebral lesions with excellent kyphosis correction.
