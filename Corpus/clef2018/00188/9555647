The postero-lateral approach in the treatment of post-traumatic canalar stenosis of the thoraco-lumbar spine. Twenty-four cases of unstable thoraco-lumbar fractures with significant canalar stenosis were operated in the Emergency Neurosurgical Unit of the Cardarelli Hospital from November 1989 to October 1991. The surgical technique was the combined transpedicular (TPA) and transarticular (TAA) postero-lateral approach, posterior osteosynthesis and arthrodesis. The average follow-up was 20 months.No evidence of implant breakage or pseudoarthrosis was detected.The authors affirm recalibration of the posterior wall by direct impaction, epidural hemostasis, removal of extruded disc fragments and dural repair are the advantages offered by this technique without compromise the contsrist stability. This approach represents an alternative to single posterior and combined anterior-posterior approaches in the management of the thoraco-lumbar fractures with severe canal stenosis.
