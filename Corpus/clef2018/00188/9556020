Anatomy of the shaken baby syndrome. Shaken baby syndrome refers to the constellation of nonaccidental injuries occurring in infants and young children as a consequence of violent shaking. The typical victim of shaken baby syndrome is a male infant younger than six months of age who is alone with the perpetrator at the time of injury. Occurrence of the syndrome is unrelated to race, gender, socioeconomic status, or education. The characteristic injuries observed in shaken baby syndrome include subdural hemorrhages, retinal hemorrhages, and fractures of the ribs or long bones. Although each of these injuries may result from violent shaking of the victim, the most severe brain injuries result from the addition of a forceful impact of the infant's or child's head against a firm surface. The unique anatomic features of the infant's head and skeletal system, which account for the type and pattern of injuries observed in shaken baby syndrome, are emphasized in this article.
