Functional urination disorders in patients recovering in an intensive care unit for more than 30 days. Patients in rest-homes, intensive care units, long hospitalization and dialysis and whoever stays in a hospital continuously or occasionally for long periods of time may run into the well-known and typical complications of prolonged hospitalization. We have studied the urologic aspect in all the cases of the Medical- Surgical Emergency Institute in the Hospital of Ancona (seated in Torrette), over the period 1990-96, in patients hospitalized for at least 30 days. All the patients were followed and studied with the same method, though taking into account their different pathological conditions. They were treated by the same medical and paramedical staff. The same antibiotic therapy and the same checkup were adopted for all of them. We have noticed that out of 122 patients the most frequent pathologies have been urinary infections (19%) while sepsis with different pathogenesis was recorded in 4% of the patients. The method of study applied during and after the hospitalization was used also in rehabilitation centres and included: urologic examination, rectal touch (in men), direct X-ray of the abdomen, ultrasound of the urinary tract, X-ray urography, if required
