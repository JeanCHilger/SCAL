The role of preoperative cervical spine X-rays in rheumatoid arthritis. The cervical spine is frequently involved in rheumatoid arthritis and yet there exists no consensus on the need to screen for cervical spine subluxations preoperatively. We reviewed retrospectively 77 patients who underwent 132 operations under general or regional anaesthesia over a 44-month period. We found that while the majority of patients had received preoperative X-ray screening for cervical spine instability, a third of the X-ray examinations done had been inadequate. Many anaesthetists did not repeat cervical spine X-rays if there were previously performed views available. We showed that a complete X-ray examination of the cervical spine should include flexion and extension stress views in addition to frontal views of the odontoid and entire cervical spine. Anterior atlantoaxial subluxation was the most common subluxation encountered in our study population. The detection of cervical spine instability was found to significantly affect anaesthetic management, favouring techniques that avoided unprotected manipulations of the neck under anaesthesia.
