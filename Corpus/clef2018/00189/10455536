Evaluation of the lower motor neuron integrity of upper extremity muscles in high level spinal cord injury. To evaluate the lower motor neuron (LMN) integrity of upper extremity muscles of persons with high tetraplegia (C1-C4) in order to determine muscles available for stimulation.Fourteen subjects (23 arms) were evaluated for LMN integrity. Muscles that elicited a functional response (grade 3 or better) to surface electrical stimulation were considered to have intact LMN and good candidates for FES. Strength-duration (S-D) curves were generated on muscles that showed weak (less than grade 3) or no response to surface stimulation. Muscles were considered denervated if S-D curves were discontinuous or depicted steep, increasing amplitude for pulse durations greater than 1 m.Muscles for grasp and release had intact LMN in 19 of 23 (83%) arms. The wrist extensors and flexors and pronator were excitable in 17 (74%), 20 (87%) and 19 (83%) arms, respectively. The supinator demonstrated LMN lesion in 80% of the arms. Over 90% of the biceps muscles were unresponsive to electrical stimulation and 85% and 87% of the deltoid and supraspinatus muscles, respectively, were not electrically excitable. The latissimus dorsi and triceps muscles were typically innervated (78% and 91%, respectively) and slightly more than half (52%) of the pectoralis major muscles were excitable.These data suggest that application of FES in high tetraplegia for hand and arm function would require augmentation because of the inability to stimulate the elbow flexors, deltoid and rotator cuff muscles. These data also show that several paralyzed proximal muscles with intact LMN that have been historically transferred to address shoulder paralysis in other patient populations are available for transfer and stimulation in the population with high level spinal injuries.
