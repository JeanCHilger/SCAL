Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with spinal cord compression a clinicopathological review of 25 cases. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine 25 patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) presenting with spinal cord or cauda equina compression as the first symptom that were referred to our department between 1985 and 1996. At presentation 17 patients were non-ambulatory dual sphincter impairment was found in 9 patients with a further 8 patients having bladder dysfunction only. All patients had a tissue diagnosis. Five low-grade and 20 intermediate or high-grade tumours were identified. In this latter group 4 patients were treated palliatively and the remaining 16 patients received combination chemotherapy and/or radical radiation therapy. The overall survival at 5 years is 59%. The majority of patients became ambulatory, even if paretic at presentation. This is in marked contrast to reports of patients presenting in this fashion due to metastatic carcinoma. We urge this diagnosis be considered in all patients presenting with spinal cord compression attributed to malignancy.
