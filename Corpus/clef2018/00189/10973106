Surgical treatment of traumatic lesions of medium-inferior segment of cervical spine. The most frequently injury level of cervical spine is C2, followed by C5 and C6. Injuries were most commonly sustained in the third decade of life, with a decreasing incidence in the advanced age. As part of these lesions is located in the elements of the anterior column, according to Denis's definition and, taking in consideration the biomechanics studies of the segment medium - inferior of the cervical spine, as well as the mechanisms that cause their lesions, this study was elaborated, with the intention of presenting the techniques of anterior cervical fusion, with bony graft and plates of Caspar, Morscher (CSLP) and ORION. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of anterior fixation are presented accordind to the literature review.
