Osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine depicted as dumbbell tumor by MRI. We report a case of 14-year-old male patient with osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large dumbbell-shaped paravertebral tumor in the region of the exiting left C6 nerve. A computed tomographic (CT) scan after myelography showed a much smaller bony defect in the medial aspect of the left C6 pedicle with central calcification and extensive bone sclerosis around the defect, typical of osteoid osteoma. The diagnosis was confirmed postoperatively. The resected specimen exhibited extensive vascularization of the osteoid tissue. The case is presented because MRI did not allow a specific diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, and suggested the tumor was larger than in reality it was, by also depicting the reactive inflammation around the tumor as if it were part of the tumor.
