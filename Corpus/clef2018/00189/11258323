Specialized surgical care of severe mechanical multiple trauma. The authors share their experiences with diagnosing and surgical treatment of 1792 patients with mechanical combined traumas. The average age of the patients was (31.6 +/- 1.4) years. All the patients were divided into two groups according to the medico-diagnostic methods. The traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment were used in 811 patients of the first group. Complications took place in 39.2%, lethality was 28.4%. The diagnosis in 981 patients of the second group included an ultrasound investigation, computed tomography, videothoraco- and laparoscopy. The surgical treatment was based on the objective multifactorial assessment of the trauma severity and determination of the prognosis criteria. Complications developed in 24.8% of the patients. Lethality was 19.5%.
