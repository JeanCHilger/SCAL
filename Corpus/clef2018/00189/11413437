Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion using miniplate and screws in a 7-year-old child with eosinophilic granuloma of the cervical spine. This is a case report of a 7-year-old child with eosinophilic granuloma in the cervical spine, which underwent anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion by using Miniplate and screws.To describe the use of Miniplate and screws for pediatric cervical anterior fusion.Eosinophilic granuloma is a rare disease causing destructive bony lesions of the cervical spine in children. A complete resection and fusion were considered to be the preferable treatment in our case. However, cervical spinal fusion and instrumentation in children may be technically difficult because of the size of the vertebral body and the iliac bone. In addition, a proper device for an internal fixation in pediatric patients is not yet available.A case of eosinophilic granuloma in pediatric spine was presented.We confirmed successful bony fusion and the restoration of the normal cervical curvature without recurrence of the tumor 2 years after the procedure.For proper internal fixation and prevention of dislodgement of the grafted bone, we used the Miniplate and screws as internal fixator after intralesional resection of the tumor mass.
