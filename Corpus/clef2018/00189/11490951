Surgical treatment of injuries of the thoracolumbar transition--3: Follow-up examination. Results of a prospective multi-center study by the "Spinal" Study Group of the German Society of Trauma Surgery. Prospective, multicenter study addressing late results after operative treatment of acute thoracolumbar spinal injuries.682 patients (T10-L2) were included and 372 (80%) were postoperatively followed for 2 1/4 years (4-61 months).Comparing the initially included patients (n = 682) with the study group (n = 372), no differences were observed and results were assumed to be representative. A C-type lesion or polytrauma significantly prolonged the hospital stay. The method of operative treatment did not affect the length of the rehabilitation period. Neurological improvement was observed in 3 out of 7 patients with complete, and in 44 out of 64 (69%) with incomplete lesion. The operative method did not affect the improvement rate. The physical capacity significantly decreased. After a mean of 1/2 year of disability only 71% returned to work. 48% returned to their preoperative physical level. The mean Hannover Spine Score was 68 points (preoperative 94, p < 0.001), indicating permanent impairment of function. The angle-stable internal fixator was superior in restoration of spinal alignment and best radiological results were noted after combined stabilization. Posterior stabilization lead to high re-kyphosing. No correlations between radiologic and clinical parameters were observed.All treatment methods under study were appropriate for achieving comparable clinical and functional outcome. The internal fixator is superior in restoration of the spinal alignment. Best radiological outcome is achieved by combined stabilization. Merely by direct reconstruction of the anterior column the postoperative re-kyphosing is prevented and a gain in segmental angle is achieved.
