Latex hypersensitivity in spinal cord injured adult patients. Latex hypersensitivity is a major cause of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia. Patients with spina bifida, health care or rubber industry workers have been considered at risk for latex sensitization. By analogy, the existence of other at-risk subsets of patients with latex exposure due to frequent surgical procedures has been suggested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of latex sensitization in a cohort of adult patients with spinal cord injury and repeated latex exposure. Forty-two adult patients with spinal cord injury were studied and retrospectively compared to a group of 30 children with spina bifida evaluated using a similar protocol. Patients were administered a questionnaire concerning history of latex hypersensitivity, atopy, and surgical procedures. Latex sensitivity was investigated by skin prick-tests and latex-specific IgE assay. The search for atopy was based on in vivo and in vitro tests against a panel of environmental allergens. No chronic spinal cord injured patient had a history of latex allergy. When compared with spina bifida, the number of surgical procedures was not statistically different. Although not significantly different, the prevalence of atopy was higher in spina bifida patients. The high level of latex sensitization in spina bifida patients contrasted sharply with the absence of sensitization observed on both skin and in vitro tests in patients with spinal cord injury (P<0.0001). This study confirms that adult patients with chronic neurologic defects resulting from spinal cord injury exhibit a low risk of latex sensitization. These results suggest that considering adult patients with repeated surgical procedures as a group at risk for latex sensitization because of a high degree of latex exposure should be re-examined.
