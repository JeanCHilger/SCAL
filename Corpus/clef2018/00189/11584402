Injuries from falls in the pediatric population: an analysis of 729 cases. Falls are classified as low or high level for triage purposes. Because triage criteria dictate less urgency for low-level falls, this classification scheme has important implications for pediatric emergency care.Retrospective analysis was conducted of 729 (393 low-level and 336 high-level) pediatric patients treated for fall-related trauma (1992 through 1998). Falls were classified as low (<15 feet) or high-level (> or =15 feet). All falls were reported as accidental or unintentional.The overall mortality rate was 1.6% (2.4% for high-level falls compared with 1.0% for low-level falls). All 4 patients who died of a low-level fall had an abnormal head computed tomography (CT) scan and intracranial hypertension. Half of deaths from high-level falls were attributable to intracranial injuries, and half were caused by severe extracranial injuries. Common extracranial injuries were upper extremity fracture (6.2%), lower extremity fracture (5.6%), pulmonary contusion (1.8%), pneumothorax (1.1%), liver laceration (1.1%), bowel injury (1.0%), and splenic injury (2.1%). Orthopedic and thoracic injuries resulted more commonly from high-level falls, whereas abdominal injuries were as likely to occur after a low-level fall.Intracranial injury accounts for the majority of deaths from falls. Children suffering low-level falls were at similar risk for intracranial and abdominal injuries compared with those who fell from greater heights. Pediatric trauma triage criteria should account for these findings.
