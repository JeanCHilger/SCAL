Return to work after spinal cord injury: a review of recent research. This manuscript reviews recent research on return to work (RTW) for individuals who sustain spinal cord injury (SCI), including the effects of demographics variables, occupational characteristics, workplace accommodations, quality of life, physical functional limitations, and other variable. Demographic variables that influence RTW for persons with SCI include age at injury onset, chronological age, gender, education, ethnicity, marital status, and per-injury work intensity. Others include satisfaction, and adjustment to sustaining SCI. In an effort to enhance employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities including SCI, Ticket to Work Incentive Improvement Act of 1999 (TWILA) has been passed by Congress and some states have begun implementing targeted initiatives through the State Partnership Systems Change Initiatives (SPI). Future research directions are recommended in light of recent legislative initiatives.
