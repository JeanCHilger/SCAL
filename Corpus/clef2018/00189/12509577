Cervical spine involvement in Larsen's syndrome: a case illustration. We present the progressive clinical course of a child with myelopathy attributable to cervical spine abnormalities associated with Larsen's syndrome. After anterior and posterior cervical fusion, his preoperative symptoms of weakness, gait dysfunction, and hyperreflexia have improved at 9-month follow-up. The progressive course and importance of early referral and intervention should be of interest to the general pediatric community.
