Multiple level noncontiguous fractures of the spine. From 1970 to 2000, 81 patients with noncontiguous fractures of the spine were evaluated. Of these 81 patients, 36 had a neurologic deficit. Sixty-six patients with stable injuries were treated conservatively, whereas 15 patients with unstable injuries required surgical stabilization. There was no neurologic deterioration either in the patients who had surgical stabilization or in the patients who were treated conservatively. Thirteen patients with an A score on the American Spinal Injury Association neurologic impairment scale did not improve and had a high mortality rate (61.5%). Although multiple level noncontiguous fractures of the spine are uncommon, they constitute a threat to neurologic function, and therefore warrant radiographic evaluation of the entire spine with multiple injuries.
