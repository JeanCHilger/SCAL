Identification of aberrant right subclavian artery on MR images of the cervical spine. Nine cases of aberrant right subclavian artery were identified after review of 674 magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the cervical spine. This common aortic arch anomaly is readily identified on sagittal MR images. All vessels were found in the typical retroesophageal location, abutting the esophagus from the vertebral C-7 to T-3 levels. Arterial flow created signal voids on T1-weighted images and confirmatory increased signal intensity due to flow-related enhancement on gradient-echo images. This anomaly should be recognized and distinguished from pathologic processes in the prevertebral space. The diagnosis may allay patient concern regarding their dysphagia and also have important ramifications in certain clinical settings.
