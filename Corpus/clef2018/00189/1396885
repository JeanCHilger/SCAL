Paraparesis secondary to a spinal mass as the presenting feature of erythroleukaemia in a 10-month-old child. Severe neurological impairment as the first symptom of acute leukaemia is a rather uncommon finding. We report the case of a 10-month-old infant who presented with acute paralysis of the lower extremities due to cord compression by an epidural tumour composed of malignant erythrocyte precursor cells. Diagnosis of erythroleukaemia (EL) was made by needle biopsy of the spinal epidural mass and confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Antileukaemic treatment in combination with radiotherapy to the epidural tumour led to haematological remission and neurological recovery with disappearance of the mass lesion as demonstrated by MRI. However, haematological relapse occurred with death of the patient 7 months after diagnosis. This is the first reported case of EL presenting with paraparesis due to an epidural tumour. The clinical symptoms, results of cytogenetic and immunological studies and the clinical course are described.
