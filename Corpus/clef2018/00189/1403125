Posttraumatic cervical spondyloptosis at C6-7 with late-onset cord compression: a new clinical entity. Case report. An unusual case of total spondyloptosis of the cervical spine at the C6-7 level with late-onset cord compression is described in an 8-year-old girl. The patient was treated by anterior decompression and in situ fusion as it was thought hazardous to try an anatomical reduction. The patient's excellent neurological recovery postoperatively strongly supports the use of this treatment protocol. The authors believe this is the first report of a posttraumatic spondyloptosis of the cervical spine, presenting with a late-onset cord compression. A brief summary of the clinical presentation, the surgical technique, and a review of the relevant literature is presented.
