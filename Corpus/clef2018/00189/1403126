Childhood odontoid fractures evaluated with computerized tomography. Case report. A case is presented that illustrates the use of computerized tomography for the evaluation of an odontoid fracture in a child. Such a "fracture" may actually represent a "synchondrotic slip" of the odontoid and C-2 vertebral body between the neural arches of C-2. Treatment should almost always be conservative. Complete healing of the injury is expected.
