Benign tumors of the cervical spine. Benign tumors of the cervical spine are relatively infrequent but have a number of common characteristics that aid in the evaluation and treatment of these lesions. The tumors are most common in the first and second decades of life, presenting as pain, neck stiffness and torticollis. In approximately 70%, the lesions are visible on plain roentgenograms and the remainder are well visualized on bone scan and computed tomographic scan. The majority are present in the posterior elements and may be treated adequately with excisional biopsy by curettage. Stage 3 lesions are best treated by marginal excisional techniques and may require adjunctive techniques such as embolization or radiation therapy. The location of the lesion and extent of excision determine the necessity for fusion.
