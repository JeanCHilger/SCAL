The diagnostic impact of magnetic resonance imaging on the evaluation of suspected spinal cord disease. The data from 262 patients studied consecutively for suspected spinal cord disease were analysed to determine the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this clinical setting. Damage to the spinal cord was detected in a total of 188 (72%) patients and was caused by myelocompression in two thirds and by intramedullary lesions in one third of the patients. Misleading sensory levels 5 to 12 segments below the actual lesion site were seen in 26% of patients with both extra- and intramedullary types of abnormality. A negative spinal MRI implied predominantly demyelinating or inflammatory origin of the clinical symptomatology, as was indicated by additional MRI studies of the brain and CSF findings. It is concluded that MRI is the procedure of choice for assessing patients with medullary symptoms. Irrespective of localizing neurologic findings the evaluation of the entire spine and even of the brain may be necessary to obtain maximum diagnostic information.
