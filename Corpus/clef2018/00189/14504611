Urinary infections in patients with spinal cord injury. A retrospective study concerning urinary tract infections in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.To check whether the regular (1/week) urine cultures allow a more accurate treatment of urinary tract infections in SCI patients compared to empiric treatment.Ghent University Hospital, East-Flanders, Belgium.Group 1: 24 tetraplegic patients group 2: 22 paraplegic patientsAn average of four clinically significant episodes of bacteriuria were found for groups 1 and 2, while group 3 experienced very few urinary infections. The mean species turnover of the first two groups was 2. No statistically significant difference was found in antibiotic-resistance patterns of organisms isolated.Despite different catheterisation techniques in para- and tetraplegic patients, we conclude that: (1) the number of episodes of clinical significant nosocomial urinary infections is not different (2) the mean species turnover is the same
