Reoperation of the cervical spine for degenerative disease and tumor. Despite improvements in treatment for cervical spine disease over the last decade, failure that requires a reoperative procedure may represent up to 14% of the cases. With the exception of posterior foraminotomy, the most common failure that requires intervention is instability, which results in an anterior compression of the neural elements. With the advent of new operative approaches and innovative stabilization techniques, the options available to treat these patients have improved.
