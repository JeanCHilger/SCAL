The signal intensity of the normal odontoid process (dens) displayed on magnetic resonance images. In order to analyse the normal signal intensity of the medullary space of the odontoid process (dens) relative to age, the craniovertebral junction of 33 asymptomatic volunteers in six age groups was examined by means of magnetic resonance imaging. To avoid partial-volume effects 3-mm slices were used in sagittal and axial planes. The signal intensities relative to cerebral white matter varied from 0.51 to 1.23 in the sagittal plane and 0.56 to 1.51 in the axial plane. The signal intensities relative to muscle varied from 0.76 to 2.40 in the sagittal plane and 0.96 to 2.30 in the axial plane. The signal intensities relative to fat varied from 0.22 to 0.62 in the sagittal plane and 0.23 to 0.68 in the axial plane. No correlation with age of the volunteers was found. The normal medulla of the dens may exhibit a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images irrespective of age.
