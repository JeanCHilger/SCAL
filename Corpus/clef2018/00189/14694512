Bilateral neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. We report a case of bilateral neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Electrophysiological examination suggested the presence of bilateral lower brachial plexus neuropathy. Radiography showed rudimentary bilateral cervical ribs. In the cases reported in the literature to date, the clinical findings are typically unilateral despite the common presence of bilateral bony abnormalities. Neurogenic TOS should be considered in young women, even if they present with bilateral symptoms, when they have occupations requiring strenuous activity of the upper limbs.
