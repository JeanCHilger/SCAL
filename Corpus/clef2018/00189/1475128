Malgaigne pelvic ring injury in childhood. Pelvic girdle injuries leading to anterior and posterior disruption are rarely seen in children. External fixation is useful to reduce and stabilize the pelvis in order to control massive blood loss due to severe venous bleeding. The anterior tension band element of the external fixator can successfully maintain reduction of the pelvic girdle. Dislocation or fracture dislocation of the sacroiliacal joint cannot be reduced with simple traction techniques. Leg length discrepancy is to be expected when the hemipelvis is displaced. Seven cases of this rare injury in children are presented together with the late outcome. Treatment modalities are discussed.
