Treatment of congenital muscular torticollis in patients older than 8 years. The authors treated congenital muscular torticollis by sternocleidomastoid muscle release in 32 patients over 8 years of age who had not received any prior medical treatment or in whom torticollis had recurred since initial treatment. The results were analyzed to compare clinical results after an average of 39 months (range 24-74 months) by dividing the patients into two groups: patients who were still in the growing period (group 1, n=19) and patients who had finished growth (group 2, n = 13) at surgery. According to the total score table by Cheng et al (which includes motion deficits, craniofacial asymmetry, scar, band, head tilt, and subjective assessment), there were 13 excellent and 6 good results in group 1 and 2 excellent, 8 good, and 3 fair results in group 2. The clinical results were statistically less successful in group 2 than in group 1 by Cheng's score table (P <0.05). However, most patients showed marked improvement in neck motion and head tilt, with satisfactory functional and cosmetic results. Thus, in patients older than school age, even for those who have finished growth, sufficient unipolar or bipolar release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and intensive postoperative care are expected to yield satisfactory treatment results.
