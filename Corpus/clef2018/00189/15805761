An isolated sacral fracture and a fracture dislocation in two pediatric patients. Isolated sacral fractures are very rare in children. Two children, aged eight and 12 years, presented with an isolated sacral type III fracture and a fracture dislocation, respectively, both of which were not associated with any neurologic problems. Without any attempts for reduction, the fractures healed completely with conservative treatment. These cases demonstrated a high remodeling potential in children for spontaneous healing.
