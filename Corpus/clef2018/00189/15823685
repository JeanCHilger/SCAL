Cervical dumbbell meningioma and thoracic dumbbell schwannoma in a patient with neurofibromatosis. The occurrence of both dumbbell meningioma and dumbbell schwannoma in one patient has not been reported in the literature. We present a 16-year-old female patient, who had progressive bilateral hearing impairment for 5 years and a progressively enlarged, non-tender neck mass for 1.5 years. Mild motor weakness over her right upper limb was noted 1 week before admission. No caf√©-au-lait spot was noted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral cerebellopontine angle tumors, a C1-2 dumbbell tumor, and a T5-6 dumbbell tumor. Neurofibromatosis type 2 was diagnosed. The cervical spine and thoracic spine tumors were removed via one-staged combined posterior (laminectomy) and antero-lateral (transforaminal or thoracoscopic) approaches during two operations performed 1 month apart. The pathology revealed meningioma and schwannoma, respectively. The patient had good recovery after these two operations and her motor function improved. Six months after the second surgery, radiosurgery was performed for the bilateral acoustic tumors, because of enlarged tumor size on follow-up MRI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of a patient, having both dumbbell meningioma and dumbbell schwannoma. A literature review of the dumbbell tumors was done, and their treatment strategies were discussed.
