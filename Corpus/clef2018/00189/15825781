A special method of predicting mandibular growth potential for Class III malocclusion. The purpose of this study was to establish an equation to predict the mandible growth potential (GP) for Class III malocclusion on the basis of the analysis of the cervical vertebrae in a single cephalometric radiograph and to compare its predictive accuracy with other methods. Data comprised two groups each with 22 Japanese girls. Group A was examined to construct the prediction equation. Group B served to compare the predictive accuracy with the GP method and the method of Mito et al (MM). The following results were obtained: (1) an equation was determined to obtain mandible GP on the basis of measurements in the third and fourth cervical vertebral bodies and (2) the average errors between the predicted increment and the actual increment for each method were 1.45 mm for the equation, 2.91 mm for the GP method, and 2.48 mm for the MM. These results suggest that using cervical vertebral measurements might allow predicting the mandible GP length for Class III malocclusion.
