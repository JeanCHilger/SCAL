Video-assisted thoracic surgery for Ewing's sarcoma of the mediastinum in a 3-year-old girl. We report of the experience of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for a Ewing's sarcoma at the posterior mediastinum in a 3 year old girl. The patient developed common cold like symptoms and developed rapid lower limb paraplegia. A chest computed tomography (CT) showed a solid mass adjacent to the vertebrae. This was diagnosed as a Ewing's sarcoma histopathologically by CT-guided needle biopsy (CT-NB). The mass was pressing on a nerve root in the vicinity of a vertebral foramen. As the tumor reduced after induction chemotherapy, with improvement of paraplegia, the patient underwent thoracoscopic examination followed by complete removal of the tumor by VATS. After surgery, the patient underwent postoperative chemo-radiotherapy. Five years has passed after operation without tumor recurrence. VATS could be an option as combined therapy for Ewing's sarcoma when well controlled and localized under induction therapy.
