Placement of anterior cervical instrumentation without intraoperative radiography. Adequate fixation with several commonly used anterior cervical plate systems requires that the screws penetrate both the anterior and posterior cortices of the vertebral bodies. This report emphasizes the shortcomings of plain film and fluoroscopic examinations in confirming screw position through the posterior vertebral cortex in three patients with lower cervical trauma or tumor. These cases and radiographs of isolated vertebrae from the cervicothoracic region demonstrate the inadequacy of plain film/fluoroscopy for determination of the position of anterior cervical plate screws in relation to the posterior cortex. Only axial images such as those obtained with computed tomography are able to show the exact relationship of the screws to the posterior cortical curvature in C7 and T1.
