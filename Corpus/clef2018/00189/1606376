Transpedicular short-segment fusions for treatment of lumbar burst fractures. A retrospective review of 13 patients who underwent decompression and transpedicular instrumentation for lumbar burst fractures is presented. Average follow-up was 22.5 months. Eighty-four percent of patients reported little or no pain at follow-up. Sixty-nine percent of patients returned to full preinjury activity. Radiographic review demonstrated an average postoperative progression of kyphosis of 8.7%. Anterior vertebral body height was unchanged between preoperative evaluation and follow-up. Although short-segment posterior transpedicular instrumentation with VSP plates did not reestablish or maintain anatomic alignment of the lumbar spine after burst fractures, the clinical outcome was excellent.
