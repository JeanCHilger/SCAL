Pediatric spine tumors with spinal cord compromise. Twenty-nine pediatric spine tumor patients with neurologic deficit were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate tumor control, neurologic course, spinal deformity, and response to treatment. Diagnoses included 10 neuroblastomas, nine sarcomas, eight astrocytomas, and two lymphomas. Mean duration of symptoms at presentation was 8 weeks. Mean clinical follow-up was 7 years 4 months, with patient survival of 66% and a local recurrence rate of 34%. Twenty-four percent (seven of 29) of patients recovered minimal neurologic function with treatment, 76% (22 of 29) showed significant recovery, and two thirds (20 of 29) developed spinal deformity. The initial clinical response to chemotherapy appeared to be most pronounced in sarcoma patients (66% positive response).
