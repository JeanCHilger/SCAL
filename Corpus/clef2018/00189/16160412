Influence of complications on independence of patients with spinal cord injury in early rehabilitation. To evaluate the influence of complications on independence of patients after spinal cord injury during rehabilitation.Data were collected on 130 patients with spinal cord injury admitted to the Clinic of Rehabilitation, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital in 1999-2004. The study population consisted of 94 (72.3%) males and 36 (27.7%) females. Their age ranged from 16 to 80 years. The functional improvement was determined in terms of progress in independence in twelve daily living skills using Functional Independence Measure scale. Neurological status was evaluated by Standard Neurological Classification of traumatic spinal cord injury. Also, during early rehabilitation period complications were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with complications and patients without complications during rehabilitation. More passive occupational therapy procedures were applied to patients with complications in comparison with patients without complications.The results of the study showed that 44 (33.8%) cases were without complications during rehabilitation and 86 (66.2%) patients had complications. The most frequent complications were chronic pain (55.8%), urinary infection (43%), spasticity (30.2%) and pressure ulcers (20.9%). No statistically significant dependence was found between the rate of complications and age, gender and level of injury (p>0.05). Statistically significant dependence has been observed only between the rate of complication and completeness of injury (p<0.05). The change of the increased independence of patients without complications during rehabilitation was statistically significantly greater in comparison with patients who had complications (p<0.05).
