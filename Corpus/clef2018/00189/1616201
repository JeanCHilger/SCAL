Pseudosubluxation of C2-C3 in childhood: a frequent clinico-radiological diagnostic error. Although serious cervical injuries in pediatric patients are very infrequent, the may occur occasionally as a result of a strong blow to the head. Clinical records and radiological pictures, and in some cases computer tomography, help to provide the correct diagnosis. During childhood there are several normal radiological variants that may be interpreted as pathological findings, of which pseudosubluxation C2-C3 is the most frequent. We present two such cases and discuss the clinical and radiological criteria for the differential diagnosis between normal variants and injuries to the cervical spine in pediatric patients.
