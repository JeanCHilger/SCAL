Scalp as a donor site for grafts to facial and neck burns in children. In facial and neck burns, attention to cosmetic details, in addition to preservation of function, is crucial. The authors describe use of the scalp as a graft donor site for such burns. The advantages include excellent colour match of the graft and minimal morbidity at the donor site. The technique for graft harvest is outlined, and the potential pitfalls are described. Based on their experience with this technique, the authors believe the scalp should be considered as a donor graft site during the acute phase of facial and neck burns.
