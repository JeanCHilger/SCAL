The Klippel-Feil syndrome: implications for Naval service. The Klippel-Feil anomaly is usually discovered by serendipity on cervical spine X-rays. Although it may encompass many vertebrae, the typical case is an isolated fusion of two vertebrae. Nearly 1% of the general population has this anomaly and its incidence in the Navy is likely similar. Increased susceptibility to spinal cord injury has been reported in individuals with the Klippel-Feil syndrome. Unusual stress on the head and neck inherent to various aspects of naval service place such persons at risk for debilitating or fatal injury. An algorithm for evaluating suspected Klippel-Feil syndrome is provided.
