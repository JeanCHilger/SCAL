Transverse fracture of the sacrum: value of imaging. A case report. Transverse fractures of the sacrum with major displacement are rare and often misdiagnosed. A case of transverse fracture of the sacrum with cauda equina injury is reported. The diagnosis was not recognized initially. Conventional radiographs of the pelvis failed to demonstrate the fracture. True lateral sacral views and CT scan with reconstructions allowed analysis of the different sagittal fracture lines to facilitate surgical planning. These examinations should be considered in all patients with history of high energy trauma and clinical signs indicating lumbosacral injury.
