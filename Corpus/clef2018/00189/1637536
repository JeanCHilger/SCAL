Gunshot wounds to the head and neck. Gunshot wounds to the head and neck contribute to substantial medical, economic, and social problems in the United States today.

Data show substantial trends in patient demographics and corroborate other reports in the trauma literature. Controversies in patient management continue, but current evidence favors a protocol of selective surgical exploration.
