Diffusion tensor imaging of intraaxial tumors at the cervicomedullary and pontomedullary junctions. Report of two cases. Brainstem gliomas are a heterogeneous group of lesions that account for 15% of all pediatric tumors of the central nervous system. Diagnosis and treatment planning for these tumors is based on the observation of Epstein and Farmer that the growth of lesions with low malignant potential is limited by the anatomical structures of the brainstem. Surgery is offered only to those patients with a high probability of harboring a low-grade tumor, because the attendant risk for significant morbidity outweighs the therapeutic benefit of debulking the tumor in cases of high-grade tumors. The authors report two cases that highlight the potential of diffusion tensor (DT) imaging to identify local white matter tracts in the pons, medulla, and cervical cord and to improve the preoperative assessment of low-grade gliomas. Preoperative DT imaging in both cases demonstrated that the white matter tracts were displaced by the bulk of the low-grade tumors but were structurally preserved. Intraoperative and neurological findings were consistent with the preoperative interpretation of the DT images. These cases demonstrate that DT imaging is a useful method for visualizing the relationship between tumor and normal brainstem white matter architecture, as well as for improving the surgical evaluation and management of pediatric brainstem tumors.
