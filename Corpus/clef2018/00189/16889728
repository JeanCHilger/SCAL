Diagnosis and treatment for the injury of cervical disc and longitudinal ligament. To study the diagnosis and treatment for the injury of cervical disc and longitudinal ligament.From 2001 to 2005, the clinical data of sixty-three patients with cervical disc and longitudinal ligament injury were studied. Early treatment was done based on spinal cord injuries and spinal stabilities by X rays and MRI. Early operation was done in fifty-four cases and early non-operation in nine cases.The follow-up time was six to forty-one months in all patients. The neurological recovery was found in two of eight complete SCI post-operation, thirty-one in thirty-nine incomplete SCI. Cervical collar or plaster orthotic were used in nine cases with four to six weeks. Evidence of instability was noted in four patients, who were operated with anterior decompression fusion. Neck chronic pain was found in two patients, anterior decompression and fusion was done in one with cervical spinal cord compression.MRI examination is the most value measure for the diagnosis of cervical disc and longitudinal ligament injury. Early anterior decompression and fusion was an important approach for cervical disc and longitudinal ligament injury.
