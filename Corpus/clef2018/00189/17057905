Thoracic spinal cord avulsion without radiologic abnormalities: case report. Spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormalities is a rare condition that occurs more frequently in children and contributes to a high rate of morbidity among these patients. We report the case of a five-month-old infant, victim of automobile accident, who was brought to our service with a sensitive level in T2 and bilateral crural paraplegia. Radiographic exams and computed tomography of spine did not evidence of bone or ligaments injuries. Magnetic resonance image showed complete spinal cord transection and spine avulsion in the segment between T3 and T7. We discuss this pathology according to its epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognostic aspects.
