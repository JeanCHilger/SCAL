Comparison of the relative benefits of 2 versus 10 days of soft collar cervical immobilization after acute whiplash injury. To investigate the effects of 2-day and 10-day immobilization of the cervical spine on pain, range of motion (ROM), and disability of patients with Quebec Task Force (QTF) grade II whiplash injuries.Randomized controlled trial.University hospital emergency department.Seventy patients with acute QTF grade II whiplash injuries.At the intake examination within 24 hours after the whiplash trauma, the patients were randomized to 2 therapy groups (2-d or 10-d immobilization with a soft cervical collar). All patients received pain drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and after 7 days, all patients started a standardized physiotherapy program 2 to 3 times a week.Patients' pain and disability scores were assessed using visual analog scales and ROM was assessed using a goniometer. All parameters were measured within 24 hours after injury and after 2 and 6 months.After 2 months, the different periods of immobilization (2d or 10d) were associated with comparable improvements in pain symptoms (median, 4.60 vs 4.65), ROM (median, 100.0 degrees vs 117.5 degrees ), and disability score (median, 4.90 vs 5.15). No statistically significant differences could be identified between the 2 treatment groups. After 6 months, persistent pain was reported by 4 patients in each group (12.5%).In patients with QTF grade II whiplash injuries, there is no short- or long-term difference between 2-day and 10-day immobilization with a cervical collar in terms of pain, ROM, or disability.
