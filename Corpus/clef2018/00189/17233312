Immediate resolution of tonsillar herniation and severe cervicothoracic syringomyelia after third ventriculostomy for hydrocephalus caused by a brainstem tumor. Case report. The authors report the case of a patient who harbored a large intrinsic brainstem tumor associated with tonsillar herniation, hydrocephalus, and severe cervicothoracic syringomyelia. This 15-year-old girl had a 2-month history of progressively worsening headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large tumor in the dorsolateral brainstem accompanied by hydrocephalus as well as a cervicothoracic syrinx extending to the level of T-8. She underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy that resulted in a marked decrease in the ventricle size as well as complete resolution of the syrinx and tonsillar herniation within 4 days. Clinical and neuroimaging findings of the case along with a pertinent literature review are presented.
