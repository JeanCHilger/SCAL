Surgical strategy for wound to the neck under conditions of medical institutions in peace time. The work is based on a clinical-statistical analysis of results of treatment of 316 wounded with injuries to the neck got in different situations in St. Petersburg and admitted to the clinic of field surgery and other medical institutions of the city. It was found that unfavorable outcomes of treatment of neck wounds of peace time depend on the character of the neck wound, adequacy of medical aid at the pre-hospital period, the decision on the medico-diagnostic strategy. The decision on the medico-diagnostic strategy for wounded to the neck must depend on the diagnostic resources of the medical institution and the succession and volume of the medico-diagnostic measures must be chosen depending on the general state, life-threatening consequences of the neck wound and severe associated injuries of other anatomical areas.
