The value of multidetector row computed tomography in the diagnosis of traumatic clivus epidural hematoma in children: a three-year experience. Clivus epidural hematoma (CEH) is reported to be extremely rare. However, we consider that CEH may not be as rare as commonly thought, and that it may often go unrecognized because of diagnostic problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) in the diagnosis of CEH.Twenty-seven children aged less than 16 years who had experienced traffic crashes or falls were retrospectively evaluated with MDCT including sagittal reconstruction of the cervical spine.Sagittal reconstructed images showed definitive findings of CEH in 3 (13%) of the 24 traffic-crash patients.MDCT can show definitive findings of CEH, and diagnostic problems can be solved through the utilization of MDCT. We consider that CEH may be more common than previously thought.
