Progressive myelopathy due to meningeal thickening in shunted patients: description of a novel entity and the role of surgery. Spinal cord compression due to meningeal thickening is a rare occurrence in shunted patients. Because of the long delay to clinical onset, this complication has not been identified as yet.We report on nine cases of shunt-related progressive myelopathy due to meningeal thickening (SPMMT).We reviewed our database of shunted children, for cases having developed progressive tetraparesis due to cervical meningeal thickening.We identified nine observations of SPMMT, eight of these with hydrocephalus due to neonatal meningitis the last case had Dandy-Walker malformation shunted at birth and suffered postoperative meningitis. The age of clinical onset of myelopathy was between 6 and 20 years (median 12.8). All patients presented with slowly progressive walking difficulties with falls and no spinal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed typically a thickened dura mater with collapse of the arachnoid space, compensatory expansion of the epidural fat, and T2 hyperintensity in the spinal cord. We operated on seven patients for surgical decompression and arachnoidolysis: One died postoperatively because of shunt malfunction, and two others died later of complications of tetraplegia. Three patients were aggravated after surgery, three experienced partial improvement, but one of these subsequently deteriorated again.SPMMT appears to be a novel and well-defined clinical and pathological entity its pathological and radiological features are stereotyped
