Cervical column morphology related to head posture, cranial base angle, and condylar malformation. The present study describes the cervical column as related to head posture, cranial base, and mandibular condylar hypoplasia. Two groups were included in the study. The 'normal' sample comprised 21 subjects, 15 females aged 23-40 years (mean 29.2 years), and six males aged 25-44 years (mean 32.8 years) with neutral occlusion and normal craniofacial morphology. The condylar hypoplasia group comprised the lateral profile radiographs of 11 patients, eight females, and three males, aged 12-38 years (mean 21.6 years). For each individual, a profile radiograph was taken to perform a visual assessment of the morphology of the cervical column. For the normal group only, the profile radiographs were taken in the standardized head posture to measure the head posture and the cranial base angle. Cervical column: Morphological deviations of the cervical column occurred significantly more often in the subjects with condylar hypoplasia compared with the normal group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The pattern of morphological deviations was significantly more severe in the subjects with condylar hypoplasia compared with the normal group (P < 0.01). Cervical column related to head posture and cranial base: The cervicohorizontal and cranial base angles were statistically larger in females than in males (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). No statistically significant age differences were found. Only in females was the cervical lordosis angle (OPT/CVT, P < 0.01), the inclination of the upper cervical spine (OPT/HOR, P < 0.05), and the cranial base angle (n-s-ba, P < 0.05) significantly positively correlated with fusion of the cervical column. These associations were not due to the effect of age.
