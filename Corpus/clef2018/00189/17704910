Percutaneous vertebroplasty for eosinophilic granuloma of the cervical spine in a child. We report a case of eosinophilic granuloma at the fourth cervical vertebra in a 10-year-old girl presenting with a 1-month history of cervical pain and stiffness. This lesion was histologically diagnosed by needle biopsy and then treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. After the procedure, the cervical pain and stiffness resolved rapidly. The height of the vertebral body remained stable without further collapse over a 6-month follow-up period.
