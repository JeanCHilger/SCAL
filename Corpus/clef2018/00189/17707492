Electrophysiologic and clinical data support the use of dorsal root entry zone myelotomy in syringosubarachnoid shunting for syringomyelia. The objectives of this study were to correlate preoperative changes in SEPs with clinical sensory dysfunction and to establish their importance in planning the microsurgical approach, either by DM myelotomy or by DREZ myelotomy, for patients with syringomyelia.In addition to conducting clinical sensory examination, we evaluated the N13 potential after median nerve stimulation and CPs after tibial nerve stimulation intraoperatively before performing myelotomy on patients with syringomyelia (N = 14).Eleven patients with intact DS presented with unilateral PTD, and 9 had distressing unilateral dermatomal pain. Deep sensibility was affected in 3 patients (bilaterally in 1 patient) without PTD. Patients with PTD were likely to have spontaneous pain (P = .005). A significant correlation between preoperative PTD and the absence of the N13 potential was demonstrated on the right (P = .015) and left (P = .004) sides. In patients with PTD, DREZ myelotomy on the symptomatic side is suggested as the treatment of choice, whereas DM myelotomy might be superior in patients without PTD.Absence of pain or temperature sensation in patients with syringomyelia is usually accompanied by same-sided loss of the N13 potential, suggesting damage to the DH gray matter. Deep sensibility is typically normal, and DREZ myelotomy with preservation of DCs is proposed as the treatment of choice. Conducted potentials are usually distorted in patients with normal pain or temperature sensation and affected vibration and posture sensation, suggesting damage to DCs and making DM myelotomy the treatment of choice. Electrophysiologic and clinical data support the use of DREZ myelotomy in syringosubarachnoid shunting for syringomyelia in patients whose DCs have an intact function.
