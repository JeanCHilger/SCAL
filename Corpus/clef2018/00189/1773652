Old traumatic lesions of the dorsal and lumbar spine. The authors present 71 cases of malunion or old traumatic lesions. They result from an unadapted initial surgical or functional treatment. The pain symptoms are in the form of vertebral pain or nerve root pain, often associated with signs of neurological deficit. The authors emphasize the stability or instability of the lesion in order to assess its reducibility. The radiographic exploration (dynamic views, MRI, CT, medullary arteriography) would serve as a guide for the treatment strategy. The authors do not report any case of permanent postoperative neurological aggravation. Three surgical options are analyzed (anterior approach, posterior approach and "three-stage" surgery). An enlarged posterior approach enables treatment and reduction of all malunions, except if a medullary feeder artery is present on the site of the lesion. The pain symptoms improve in 87% of all cases. The authors do not report any permanent postoperative neurological aggravation.
