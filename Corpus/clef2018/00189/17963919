Pitfalls in treatment of acute cervical spinal cord injury using high-dose methylprednisolone: a retrospect audit of 111 patients. Earlier studies suggested that the use of high-dose IV MP was the gold standard of care for the treatment of ASCI, but this has been debated. This study aims to identify the effects of high-dose MP in treatment of cervical SCI and how the treatment might be improved.The medical records of 138 patients with cervical spinal injury secondary to blunt injuries were retrospectively reviewed to determine the steroid administration protocol, effects, and complications. The findings on admission were compared with those at discharge and at the most recent outpatient follow-up visit. Significant neurologic improvement was defined as increase in at least 1 clinical grade according to the Frankel classification system.Significantly more motor and sensory recovery was noted (complete ASCI, 69% vs 0 incomplete ASCI, 70% vs 50%) in patients treated with surgery and MP than in patients without such treatment. Moreover, 87% (14/16) of patients with complete ASCI (unlike patients with incomplete [8/28, 28.6%] and mild [2/14, 14.3%] ASCI) treated with MP had steroid-related complications, and 1 patient died from sepsis related to a perforated peptic ulcer. Mean hospitalization was significantly shorter for the patients who underwent tracheostomy (49 days, ranged from 22 to 110 days) vs nontracheostomy(94 days, ranged from 28-268 days).Early intervention with surgery and MP is critical. Although treatment with MP for 24 or 48 hours significantly improves motor and sensory function of patients with ASCI, harmful side effects limit its functional efficacy in patients with complete ASCI. Early tracheostomy can shorten hospital stay in patients with complete ASCI.
