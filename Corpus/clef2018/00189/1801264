Nerve root recovery in complete injuries of the cervical spine. Thirty-six patients with complete quadriplegia were reviewed. Twenty-two underwent surgery, and 14 did not. There were 11 burst fractures and 3 extension fracture-dislocations, which were treated with anterior decompression and rigid plate fixation. There were 22 flexion injuries that were treated with posterior stabilization using Kirschner-wire tension band fixation, Harrington compression hooks, or Halifax laminar hooks. The non-operative group was treated with skeletal traction with skull tongs for 6-12 weeks followed by the application of a hard collar or halo vest for 3 months. Of the 22 patients who underwent surgery, 32% descended one level and 18% two levels. In the nonoperative group, only one patient descended one level. It is concluded that the heretofore pessimistic outlook regarding complete quadriplegia is unwarranted and that a more aggressive approach may result in a better functional outcome.
