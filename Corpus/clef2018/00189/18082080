EXIT procedure in the management of severe foetal airway obstruction. the paediatric otolaryngologist's perspective. The ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure is a technique designed to allow partial foetal delivery via caesarean section with establishment of a safe foetal airway by either intubation, bronchoscopy, or tracheostomy while foetal oxygenation is maintained through utero-placental circulation. The most common indication for the EXIT procedure is the presence of foetal airway obstruction, which is usually caused by a prenatal diagnosed neck mass. We report three cases of head and neck tumours with airway obstruction treated by means of EXIT and with different solutions in the management of the airway. With the involvement of Paediatric Otolaryngologists in EXIT, new indications and select variations from the standard EXIT protocol should be considered.
