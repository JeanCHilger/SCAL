Autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord lesions: complication of voiding cystourethrography and lleal loopography. Autonomic dysteflexia is a pathologic reflex which occurs in patients with a spinal cord lesion above T7. The most dangerous manifestation of this reflex is marked increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The trigger is the distension of the urinary bladder, urethra, rectum, or intestine. It can and does occur during radiological examinations such as cystourethrography, loopography, and probably during the barium enema. Because of possible deleterious consequences of marked hypertension, blood pressures in these patients should be continuously monitored during the examinations and appropriate measures immediately instituted should the reaction occur.
