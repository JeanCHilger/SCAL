Endonasal endoscopic resection of the odontoid process in a nonachondroplastic dwarf with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: feasibility of the approach and utility of the intraoperative Iso-C three-dimensional navigation. Case report. The authors report a case of a nonachondroplastic dwarf with severe basilar invagination and compression of the cervicomedullary junction (CMJ) due to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Initially excellent reduction of the invagination and decompression of the CMJ was achieved using posterior fixation. However, 1 month postoperatively symptoms recurred and the authors found imaging evidence of recurrence as well. The patient subsequently underwent an endoscopic transnasal resection of the dens with assistance of Iso-C navigation. He recovered well and tolerated regular diet on postoperative Day 2.
