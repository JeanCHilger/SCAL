The effect of rhythmic auditory stimulation on the gait parameters of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury: an exploratory pilot study. This exploratory pilot study examined the immediate entrainment effects of rhythmic auditory stimulation on the gait parameters of cadence, velocity, and stride length in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury. Seventeen patients with incomplete spinal cord injury, mean age of 41 years and on average 5.88 years postinjury, participated in a within-subjects repeated measures design with counterbalanced conditions. Participants completed four, 10-meter walks: walk 1, participants walked at their normal pace without rhythm walk 2, participants walked to a rhythm set to the tempo of their uncued normal walk
