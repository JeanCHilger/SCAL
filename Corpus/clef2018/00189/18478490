Chemotherapy as a therapeutic option for congenital neuroblastoma complicated by paraplegia. Spinal compression can be a complication of neuroblastoma (NBL). Delayed or insufficient treatment of this condition may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. Therefore, appropriate treatment should be introduced promptly. Therapeutic options include neurosurgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.We report on a newborn male with congenital NBL who presented with complete paraplegia of the legs at birth. Tumor size diminished quickly and neurological symptoms partly recovered after the patient received chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, doxorubicine, and cyclophosphamide.Rapid initiation of chemotherapy was safe and effective in a neonate with NBL complicated by spinal cord compression.
