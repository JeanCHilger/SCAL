Multidisciplinary pediatric trauma team training using high-fidelity trauma simulation. Trauma resuscitations require a high level of team performance. This study evaluated the impact of a comprehensive effort to improve trauma care through multidisciplinary education and the use of simulation training to reinforce training and evaluate performance.For a 1-year period, expanded trauma education including monthly trauma simulation sessions using high-fidelity simulators was implemented. All members of the multidisciplinary trauma resuscitation team participated in education, including simulations. Each simulation session included 2 trauma scenarios that were videotaped for debriefing as well as subsequent analysis of team performance. Scored simulations were divided into early (initial 4 months) and late (final 4 months) for comparison.For the first year of the program, 160 members of our multidisciplinary team participated in the simulation. In the early group, the mean percentage of appropriately completed tasks was 65%, whereas in the late group, this increased to 75% (P < .05). Improvements were also observed in initial assessment, airway management, management of pelvic fractures, and cervical spine care.Training of a multidisciplinary team in the care of pediatric trauma patients can be enhanced and evaluated through the use of high-fidelity simulation. Improvements in team performance using innovative technology can translate into more efficient care with fewer errors.
