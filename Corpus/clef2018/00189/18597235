Cervical intradural lipoma with associated hemivertebra formation at C6 level: a case report. INTRODUCTION AND CASE DESCRIPTION: Intramedullary lipomas are rare tumours of the spinal cord and account for about 1% of all spinal neoplasms. These lesions can occur anywhere along the length of spinal cord, but are frequently localized to the lower thoracic and lumbosacral levels. The authors present a 18-year-old female with intractable shoulder and neck pain and progressive weakness in the upper extremities, harbouring a cervical intradural lipoma with intramedullary extension, along with concomitant scoliosis.Despite its benign nature, surgical treatment of these lesions in symptomatic patients generally provides satisfactory relief of symptoms. Radical removal of spinal intradural lipomas is not recommended since attempts at complete excision carry an unacceptable risk of postoperative morbidity and sufficient decompression with or without duraplasty generally provides a successful clinical outcome.
