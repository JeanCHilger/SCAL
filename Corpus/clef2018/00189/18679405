Motor scores on the functional independence measure after pediatric spinal cord injury. Retrospective descriptive analysis.The purpose of this study was to report the functional ability of children with spinal cord injury (SCI) as recorded on motor items of the functional independence measure (FIM) and to examine the factors associated with FIM motor admission and post-discharge gain scores.Scores on FIM motor items were analyzed from 941 children (age range: 0-21 years mean: 13 years 4 monthsThe FIM motor scores at admission were negatively correlated with age, neurological level and completeness of injury. Gain in FIM motor scores was significant across neurological levels, and was associated with lower admission FIM motor scores, lower neurological level, incomplete injury, traumatic injury and less time between injury and admission.The motor function of children after pediatric SCI depends on neurological level and completeness of injury, among other factors. FIM motor scores can improve with intervention even several years after the injury.
