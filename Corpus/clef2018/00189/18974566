Multichannel somato sensory evoked potential study demonstrated abnormalities in cervical cord function in brachial monomelic amyotrophy. Brachial monomelic amyotrophy (BMMA) is known to affect the central cervical cord gray matter resulting in single upper limb atrophy and weakness.Case series of BMMA patients who underwent somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) studies at a tertiary referral center.We proposed to record Multichannel Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (MCSSEP) from median and ulnar nerves with neck in neutral and neck fully flexed position in 17 patients with classical BMMA seen over three years.Recordings were done from both median (MN) and ulnar nerves (UN). N9, P9, N13, N20 potentials were recorded and amplitudes measured. SSEPs were performed in 22 age-matched healthy men. Amplitudes of cervical response were calculated by N13/P9 ratio and compared in both positions.Among the controls N13 amplitude was always normal {MN: mean N13/P9 - 0.96 in neutral 0.95 in flexed}{UN: mean N13/P9 - 0.82 in neutralMCSSEP in BMMA with neck flexion caused a significant reduction of the cervical N13 response indicating segmental cervical cord dysfunction.
