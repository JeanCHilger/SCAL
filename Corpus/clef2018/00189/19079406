Cervical spine clearance: a review and understanding of the concepts. Cervical spine injury is relatively rare, occurring in only 2% to 3% of patients with blunt trauma who undergo imaging studies. However, timely and accurate recognition of cervical spine injury is essential for the optimal management of patients with blunt trauma as subsequent morbidity includes prolonged immobilization. Evaluation of cervical spine injuries should begin in the emergency department and involves a combination of pediatric, trauma, orthopedic, and neurosurgeons for definitive management. Knowing which patients are at highest risk for injuries will undoubtedly influence decisions on how aggressively to pursue a potential cervical spine injury and can be achieved by establishing a multidisciplinary team approach that provides cervical spine immobilization, assessment, and clearance. Implementation of such guidelines will decrease time for cervical spine clearance and incidence of missed injuries. In this article different aspects of cervical spine injuries and cervical spine clearance protocols are reviewed.
