Mortality and morbidity associated with correction of severe cervical hyperextension. Three case reports of patients with treatment of severe cervical hyperextension.Cervical hyperextension is a rare spine deformity that is associated with myopathies. Previous reports of surgical correction have reported no major operative complications. This report outlines our experience with 3 patients who experienced significant complications.The limited literature on the treatment of cervical hyperextension has good to excellent outcomes.Three case reports are presented.Three cases with severe cervical hyperextension with intraoperative correction had associated morbidity and mortality. One case had a failed intubation requiring tracheotomy. This was followed by a successful posterior release with halo traction for 2 weeks and then an instrumented posterior cervical fusion. This patient died at home 2 weeks after surgery. The second and third cases had an intraoperative spinal cord injury during a posterior release for cervical hyperextension.Patients with severe cervical hyperextension have high neurologic perioperative risk.
