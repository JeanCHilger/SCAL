Imaging of musculoskeletal disorders in children. A review of the year's literature on musculoskeletal disorders in infants and children includes many advances in imaging principles, especially MR imaging pulse sequences. We have not attempted to review these advances because the principles are essentially the same in children as in adults. We have confined this review to several topics including the importance of differentiating the findings in osteogenesis imperfecta from those in the abused child, limb-lengthening procedures in infants and children, the treatment of slipped upper femoral capital epiphysis, spinal anomalies, and skeletal abnormalities associated with cloacal exstrophy. A brief comment on cervical spine films in pediatric trauma patients is also included.
