Pre-operative irreducible C1-C2 dislocations: intra-operative reduction and posterior fixation. The "always posterior strategy". According to Menezes' algorithm, pre-operative dynamic neuroradiological investigation in C1-C2 dislocations (C1C2D) instability is strongly advocated in order to exclude those patients not eligible for posterior fixation and fusion without previous anterior trans-oral decompression. Anterior irreducible compression due to C1C2D instability, it is said, needs trans-oral anterior decompression. We reviewed our experience in order to refute such a paradigm.The study involves 23 patients who were operated on for cranio-vertebral junction (CVJ) instability all of them had C1C2D of varying degree on x-ray, computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the CVJ. Pre-operatively, irreducible C1C2D was demonstrated only in 3 patients, (2 with Down's Syndrome, one of them was harbouring os odontoideum, 1 Rheumatoid Arthritis), i.e. 13.04%At follow up (range 34-55 months-mean 45.33 months) the clinical picture was improved or stable in all patients.Pre-operative irreducibility of the C1C2D should not be an absolute indication for trans-oral decompression. An attempt to reduce the dislocation under general anaesthesia and during posterior fixation should be attempted in Down's syndrome, os odontoideum and rheumatoid arthritis.
