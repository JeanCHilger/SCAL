Posterior lumbar apophyseal ring fractures in adolescents: a report of four cases. Posterior lumbar apophyseal ring fractures are rare in adolescents. We report 4 such cases in Chinese adolescents. Two of the patients had a slipped capital femoral epiphysis 3 of them were overweight/obese. All presented with low back pain and radicular pain. Apophyseal fractures of the upper lumbar spine usually involve the lower end plate, whereas those of the lumbar sacral spine usually involve the upper end plate. The radiological features and pathophysiology are discussed. Two of the patients were treated with laminotomy and diskectomy after conservative treatment failed. All patients had complete resolution of their neurological deficits at a mean follow-up of 2 years. Despite its benign nature, long-term follow-up is necessary to define the natural course and prognosis of the disease. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose these fractures in adolescents.
