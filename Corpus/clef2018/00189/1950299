Osteosynthesis of the dens axis fracture. Fractures of the dens axis are very rare and their treatment has always been conservative. But in many fractures, principally in those of the fracture type II, a pseudarthrosis develops. The instability, which results from this pseudarthrosis is a dangerous situation, that can be responsible for late neurological complications such as quadriplegia or sudden death, even years after the primary accident. A series of 5 patients with a fracture of the dens axis, which are stabilized by a direct screw osteosynthesis, is presented. The operation technique is discussed in detail. The results of the technique are compared with other series in the recent literature.
