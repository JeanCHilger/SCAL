The prospective study project of 62 cases spinal cord injury. To rudiment analyze the different intervention factors affecting the spinal cord injury functional recovery initially through prospective study project.Designed prospective study project without clinical treatment intervention and admitted 62 spinal cord injury cases into observation group from Dec 2006 to Dec 2007. The internalized standard included acute spinal cord injury within 1 week, aged from 18 to 65 years old without sexuality difference and diagnosed as type A injury: total spinal cord injury or type B injury: non-total spinal cord injury (without movement function below the injury plane) according to clinical physical examination and combined MRI or CT examination. All the 62 cases were followed up. The spinal cord function were estimated at the time of arriving hospital, 1, 3, 6 months after injury during the following up time according to the American Spine Injury Association standard (Revised at 2000) and functional independence measure (FIM) score. The intervention factors affecting the spinal cord injury functional recovery were analyzed.Among the 62 cases, male 60 cases and female 2 cases, aged from 18 to 41 years old, mean age 24 years old, 29 cases can be classified into type A injury and 33 cases can be classified into type B injury. There was no significant difference (Index including sense ASIA, motor ASIA and FIM) between operation group and non-operation group, namely conservatively composite treatment at all observation point in all type A injury cases (P > 0.05). There was significant difference (Index including sense ASIA, motor ASIA and FIM) between operation group and non-operation group at all observation point in all type B injury cases (P < 0.05) And there was significant difference (Index including sense ASIA, motor ASIA and FIM) between operated in 8 hours (< or = 8 h) group and beyond 8 hours (> 8 h) group at all observation point in all type B operated cases (P < 0.05).Operation and operation time were of no significant value for type A injury (total spinal cord injury), but considering the nursing convenience and the need for spinal stabilities, operation decompression and internal fixation can be chosen Operation decompression should be performed as soon as quickly for type B injury (non-total spinal cord injury) in order to get better functional recovery.
