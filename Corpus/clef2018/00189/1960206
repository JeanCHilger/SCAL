Transverse cervicopertrochanteric hip fracture. A 3-year-old boy sustained a previously undescribed transverse hip fracture that involved the cervical, cervicotrochanteric, and intertrochanteric regions. The fracture was successfully treated with skeletal traction for 4 weeks using a Steinmann pin placed through the distal femoral metaphysis followed by spica cast immobilization. The 3-year follow-up examination demonstrated satisfactory growth and remodeling of the proximal femur with no evidence of osteonecrosis, premature physeal closure, or coxa vara.
