Cervical osteochondroma with postoperative recurrence: case report and review of the literature. Osteochondromas of the cervical spine are rare. We report an 8-year-old girl presenting with neck pain and a known familial predisposition for osteochondromas.Imaging revealed a presumed osteochondroma of the cervical spine located at C3. A cervical hemilaminectomy of the lesion was performed. Histopathology confirmed the lesion as an osteochondroma. Six months later, the child was found to have a recurrence of the previously resected lesion.The child was reoperated and the lesion removed along with the entire remaining lamina of C3. At 6-year follow-up, there has been no recurrence of the child's cervical lesion. We believe this to be the third reported case of recurrence of a cervical osteochondroma. Surgeons dealing with such lesions should be mindful of this complication.
