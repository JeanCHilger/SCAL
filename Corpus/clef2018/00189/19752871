Identification of the most common problems in functioning of individuals with spinal cord injury using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Cross-sectional, multicenter study.To identify the most common problems of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the early post-acute and the long-term context, respectively, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a frame of reference.International.The functional problems of individuals with SCI were recorded using the 264 ICF categories on the second level of the classification. Prevalence of impairment was reported along with their 95% confidence intervals. Data were stratified by context.Sixteen study centers in 14 countries collected data of 489 individuals with SCI in the early post-acute context and 559 in the long-term context, respectively. Impairments in thirteen ICF categories assigned to Body functions and Body structures were more frequently reported in the long-term context, whereas limitations/restrictions in 34 ICF categories assigned to Activities and Participation were more frequently found in the early post-acute context. Eleven ICF categories from the component Environmental Factors were more frequently regarded as barriers, facilitators or both by individuals with SCI in the early post-acute context as compared with individuals with SCI in the long-term context. Only two environmental factors were more relevant for people with SCI in the long-term context than in the early post-acute context.The study identified a large variety of functional problems reflecting the complexity of SCI and indicated differences between the two contexts. The ICF has potential to provide a comprehensive framework for the description of functional health in individuals with SCI worldwide.
