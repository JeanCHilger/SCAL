Open reduction and internal fixation of low subcondylar fractures of mandible through high cervical transmasseteric anteroparotid approach. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the functional and radiologic results of low subcondylar fracture fixation with modus TCP plates (Medartis, Basel, Switzerland) using a high cervical transmasseteric anteroparotid approach.A prospective study was designed, enrolling all minimum-aged 15-year-old echomorphology patients presenting with displaced low subcondylar fracture with occlusion disturbances during a 41-month period. All fractures were fixed with modus TCP plates using high cervical transmasseteric anteroparotid approach. All patients underwent immediate physiotherapy and a 6-week liquid and semiliquid feeding period. Clinical and radiologic examinations were performed at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months. A total of 35 patients presenting with 38 fractures were enrolled with a mean follow-up of 17 months.All fractures had healed at 6 months in the correct anatomic position in 73.7%. Occlusion was deemed normal in 80% of the patients. The mandibular movement was normal in 97.1%, with the mouth opening up to 40 mm, mean lateral movement of 11 mm without a difference between the 2 sides, and a mean protrusion of 12 mm. Minimal asymmetry remained in 15.6%. No facial palsy occurred, including no transient facial palsy. Complications consisted of 1 infection and 1 plate fracture requiring surgical revision.Low subcondylar fracture fixation with modus TCP plates using a high cervical transmasseteric anteroparotid approach is a safe and reproducible procedure providing excellent functional results. This procedure has been routinely performed in our department.
