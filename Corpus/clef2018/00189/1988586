Use of MR imaging-compatible Halifax interlaminar clamps for posterior cervical fusion. Twenty-one patients requiring posterior cervical fusion were treated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-compatible Halifax interlaminar clamps for internal fixation. Various levels were involved: the C1-2 level in eight cases, the C4-5 level in four, the C5-6 level in three, the C6-7 level in three, the C4-6 level in two, and the C5-7 level in one. Bilateral clamps were used in 18 cases and unilateral clamps in three. Autogenous iliac bone grafting was performed in all cases but one. Follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 18 months (average 9.2 months), with no complications or mechanical failures occurring thus far. Follow-up diagnostic studies revealed rigid fixation and fusion in all cases. The MR imaging-compatibility of the clamps allowed excellent follow-up studies with minimal artifact. Because of their ease of use, rigid stabilization, good results, lack of complications, and compatibility with MR imaging, the Halifax interlaminar clamp with bone grafting provides an ideal method for posterior cervical stabilization.
