Congenital cervical kyphosis in a child associated with tetraparesis: case report. Congenital cervical kyphosis is a rare clinical condition. We describe an infant presenting with tetraparesis, rapidly progressing to phrenic paralysis and fatal respiratory insufficiency. Therapeutic options remain challenging. Surgical arthrodesis is technically difficult, and one report of a therapeutic thermoplastic body splint is described. Final outcome, however, is dismal. No long-term survivors have been described.
