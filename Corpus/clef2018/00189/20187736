Physical capacity after 7 weeks of low-intensity wheelchair training. To simulate the effect of low-intensity exercise in early rehabilitation, we investigated the effect of a 7-week low-intensity norm duration hand rim wheelchair training on the physical capacity in untrained able-bodied individuals.Twenty-five able-bodied participants were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group: 10 participants exercised 7 weeks, three times a week at 30% heart rate reserve (HRR) for 30  min (experimental group). The control group consisted of 15 participants who did not receive training. Physical capacity (maximal isometric strength, sprint power, peak power output and peak oxygen uptake) and submaximal performance [heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO(2)), mechanical efficiency (ME)] were assessed pre- and post-training. The levels of upper-body discomfort were determined with the use of a Local Perceived Discomfort scale.Compared to the control group the experimental group significantly improved on sprint power (+31.2%), peak aerobic power output (+34%), submaximal HR, VO(2) and ME (+16.9%). The participants did not experience high levels of local discomfort in the upper body during the training.Low-intensity norm duration hand rim wheelchair training which significantly improved peak aerobic and sprint power output, efficiency and physical strain in able-bodied untrained individuals. Training at 30% HRR (3 × /week, 30  min/session) may be appropriate in untrained individuals, such as novice wheelchair users at the start of their rehabilitation, to prevent early fatigue and overuse and enhance motivation.
