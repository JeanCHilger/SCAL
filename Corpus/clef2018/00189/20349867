Combination of the AO-Magerl and load-sharing classifications for the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The AO-Magerl classification is widely accepted for the appropriate management of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures however, it fails to assess the ability of the injured spine to withstand compressive loading and cannot predict instrumentation failure after short-segment posterior fixation. The load-sharing classification depends on the degree of comminution and apposition of bony fragments.We retrospectively classified according to both classifications 100 consecutive patients with 1-level thoracolumbar burst fractures treated nonoperatively or operatively within a 7-year period. Sixty neurologically intact patients (60%) were treated nonoperatively, 15 (15%) had short posterior instrumentation, 15 (15%) had short anterior instrumentation, and 10 (10%) had combined short posterior instrumentation and anterior strut grafting. Twenty-five of the 40 (60%) surgically treated patients had neurological impairment on admission. Clinical outcome was assessed using a pain and working ability scale. Mean follow-up was 52 months (range, 24-70 months). Function was satisfactory in 55 (92%) nonoperatively treated patients and in 33 (83%) surgically treated patients. Neurological improvement by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade was observed in patients with incomplete paraplegia (70% of neurologically impaired patients) who were treated operatively.The combination of AO-Magerl and load-sharing classifications provides for accurate selection of treatment, surgical approach, and length of instrumentation, and can guide the decision for additional anterior surgery.
