Decreased bone mineral density and vertebral compression fractures in a young adult male with 21-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): is CAH an unrecognized population at risk for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis? CAH, most often due to a molecular defect in the 21-OH enzyme, results in inadequate cortisol production and subsequent life-long GC replacement.To heighten awareness for risk of GIO in children with CAH including (1) ongoing assessment of GC dosing, (2) screening for bone health, and (3) prophylactic measures/early intervention once GIO is identified.23 year-old male with 21OHD CAH referred for osteopenia.Chart review radiological, serological and urine assessment.Patient has old vertebral compression fractures and diminished BMD, the onset of which likely corresponds to excessive GC dosing during adolescence.As with other GC-dependent conditions, children with CAH may represent a previously unrecognized population at risk for GIO. Physicians need to be cognizant of the consequences of excessive GC dosing on bone health, especially during infancy and adolescence, critical periods for both linear growth as well as bone accretion.
