Intermediate Results of the Prestige LP Cervical Disc Replacement: Clinical and Radiological Analysis With Minimum Two-Year Follow-up. prospective study.present results of Prestige LP artificial cervical disc replacement (ADR).motion preservation with ADR can potentially reduce adjacent segment degeneration. METHODS.: Forty patients with 59 Prestige LP ADR were analyzed. Cervical range of motion, Neck Disability Index, Visual Analogue, Short Form-36, Modified American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, and Japanese Orthopedic Association scores and radiographs were evaluated. Clinical results were compared with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.there were 21 females and 19 males. Mean age was 43.9 years. Mean follow-up was 2.9 years. Of the patients, 62.5% had single level replacement-mainly C56 level (56%) 52.5% had myelopathy and 47.5% radiculopathyprestige LP ADR showed significant improvement in clinical outcomes at 2 years. It restores segmental lordosis and preserves segmental motion up to 2 years postoperation.
