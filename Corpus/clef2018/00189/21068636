Effectiveness of treadmill training in children with motor impairments: an overview of systematic reviews. The purpose of this review was to synthesize current evidence from systematic reviews on the effectiveness of treadmill training (TT), including partial body-weight support (PBWS) TT (PBWSTT), TT only, robotic-assist PBWSTT, and mixed TT, in children with motor impairments.Systematic literature searches were conducted in 10 databases through May 2010. Two reviewers independently selected titles, abstracts (k = 0.78), and full-text articles (k = 1.0). Of the 1166 titles retrieved, 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. Quality of included studies was assessed using AMSTAR criteria.Results of each systematic review were tabulated on the basis of levels of evidence, with outcomes categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health framework. Conflicting interpretations of outcomes were found between reviews, yet conclusions were similar.TT demonstrates encouraging results, but more rigorous research is needed before clinicians can be confident of its effectiveness and clinical guidelines can be developed.
