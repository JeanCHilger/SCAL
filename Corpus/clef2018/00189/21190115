A rare presentation of crush injury: transanal small bowel evisceration. Case report and review of the literature. Evisceration of the small intestine through the anus is an extremely rare event in children. We report a 2-year-old boy who sustained transanal small bowel evisceration associated with bilateral diaphragmatic rupture, left diaphragmatic herniation, and spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality which happened after crushing by motor vehicle. We reviewed children with transanal small bowel evisceration and discussed etiological differences between children and adult. We also discussed the basic principles of management and follow up in these patients.
