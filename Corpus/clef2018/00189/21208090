Incidental findings arising with cone beam computed tomography imaging of the orthodontic patient. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of orthodontic patients is a diagnostic tool used increasingly in hospital and primary care settings. It offers a high-diagnostic yield, short scanning times, and a lower radiation dose than conventional computed tomography. This article reports on four incidental findings-that appear unrelated to the scan's original purpose-arising in patients for whom CBCT was carried out for orthodontic purposes. It underlines the need for complete reporting of the data set.
