A re-investigation of the relationship between head posture and craniofacial growth. This investigation was designed to repeat classic studies into the associations between head posture and growth as a single unified study using up-dated methods for gathering and analysing the data. The material comprised the cephalometric radiographs of 59 children (34 males and 25 females) recorded in natural head posture (self-balance position), at the beginning and end of a period of observation during which no treatment was performed (mean age at initial radiograph 11.76 years, mean interval between radiographs 3.52 years).  Correlation analysis (corrected for multiple inference and adjusted for dependency between the variables) showed the strongest associations to be between growth direction of the face and the change in posture. No association was found between growth (direction or magnitude) and pre-observation posture. The most prominent associations were between the change in cranio-cervical posture (CCP) and variables representing the growth directions of the mandible (r = 0.72, P < 0.0001) anterior maxilla (r = 0.49, P < 0.001)
