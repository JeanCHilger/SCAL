Acute haematogenous upper cervical osteomyelitis in neonates: a report of two cases. Haematogenous osteomyelitis in newborns and infants usually occurs in the long bones and is rare in the short or flat bones. We present two neonates with osteomyelitis of the upper cervical spine affecting the second to fourth cervical vertebrae and the first and second cervical vertebrae, respectively. Despite some delay in diagnosis, both responded successfully to conservative treatment with antibiotics, a cervical collar and needle puncture. The latest follow-up at six and seven years, respectively, showed no persistent neurological deficit and a normal diameter of the cervical spinal canal on MRI.
