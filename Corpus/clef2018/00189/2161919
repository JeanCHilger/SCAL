Solitary spinal cord metastasis of Wilms' tumor. Wilms' tumor metastasis to the spinal cord is very rare at any age. We recently encountered a case of a 4-year-old girl, who had a solitary lumbar spinal cord metastasis about 1 year following the initial nephrectomy and an incomplete course of chemotherapy for a stage I Wilms' tumor. The patient recovered uneventfully after decompressive laminectomy, removal of the extradural spinal cord tumor, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy according to the National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS)-IV protocol.
