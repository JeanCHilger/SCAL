Anterior single screw fixation of odontoid fracture with intraoperative Iso-C 3-dimensional imaging. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of isocentric C-arm three-dimensional (Iso-C 3D) fluoroscopy for the insertion of an anterior odontoid screw. The results of the Iso-C 3D group were compared with that of an historic control group using conventional fluoroscopy.Twenty-nine patients diagnosed with type II or rostral-type III odontoid fractures were treated with a single anterior screw fixation in this study. The Iso-C 3D group included 13 patients and the other 16 patients were in the historic control group. All operations were performed by a single surgeon using standard procedure and manner. The clinical and radiographic results were recorded and compared between the two groups.The fluoroscopy time in the Iso-C 3D group was 42.9 s as compared to 68.1 s in the control group (P < 0.01). The mean operative time was 91.5 min in the Iso-C 3D group when compared with 81.6 min in the control group (P = 0.20). The rate of bony fusion was 96.6% (28/29), the failure rate of reduction or fixation was 13.8% (7.7% in Iso-C 3D group 18.8% in control group). The Smiley-Webster scale showed that 90% of patients achieved good or better outcomesIn conclusion, this technique can be safely extended to the treatment of technically difficult to treat spinal injuries and at the same time reduce total radiation exposure time both for the patient and the surgeon.
