Ossifying lipoma of c1-c2 in an adolescent. Ossifying lipomas, characterized by their independence of bony connection to the skeleton, are extremely rare benign neoplasms. They have primarily been described in adults older than 50 years of age and occur in the head and neck region. The etiology is unknown. Excision is the preferred treatment. The objective of this study is to report the case of a rare ossifying lipoma immediately anterior to C1 to C2, requiring a transoral approach for excision.The case of an adolescent with a retropharyngeal mass is described.A 15-year-old female patient presented with an asymptomatic parapharyngeal mass detected on routine physical examination. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging noted a calcified, left-sided, parapharyngeal mass, approximately 3×2×2 cm, anterior to C1 and C2, most consistent with a benign osseous lesion. A transoral approach was used to excise the mass. Histologic examination demonstrated an ossifying lipoma. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete excision. The postoperative course was unremarkable, and the patient has had no recurrence at 6-month follow-up.This case demonstrates that a transoral approach to a lesion anterior to C1 to C2 in an adolescent can be safe, complete, and effective.Case Report, level 5.
