Cervical cystic swelling in an adolescent: unusual association of a cervical mature teratoma with vertebral anomalies and a history of gastric duplication cyst. A 14-year-old girl presented with a cervical cystic swelling in association with deformity of cervical vertebrae. As a child, she had been treated for gastric duplication. Pathologic examination of the resected cervical swelling revealed a mature teratoma. We discuss possible embryologic associations, which could explain the unusual combination of a mature teratoma with vertebral anomalies and gastric duplication.
