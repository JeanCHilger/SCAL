Extended lower trapezius myocutaneous flap in burn scar reconstruction of the face and neck of children. We aimed to present the use of extended lower trapezius myocutaneous flaps in children with scaring and contractures of the face and neck due to burns.We retrospectively reviewed the use of 12 extended trapezius myocutaneous flaps in 7 males and 4 females ranging in age from 1.5 to 7 years. An expander was embedded under the deep layer of the lower trapezius in order to ensure the integrity of the vascular network between the lower trapezius muscle and the skin. Dissection was performed at the deep layer of the supraspinous muscle where the descending branch of the transverse cervical artery passes between the deep layer of the trapezius muscle and the superficial layer of the supraspinous muscle.All surgeries were performed successfully with no intraoperative complications. The flaps ranged in size from 30 × 18 cm to 38 × 22 cm. There were no postoperative complications, except for mild tip necrosis in one case. There were no donor site complications. All patients had good functional and cosmetic outcomes.The extended lower trapezius myocutaneous flap is valuable in the management of burn reconstruction in the pediatric population.
