Alteration in sleep quality in patients with mechanical insidious neck pain and whiplash-associated neck pain. This study aimed to determine differences in sleep quality between patients with mechanical neck pain, patients with whiplash (WAD) pain, and healthy controls and to determine the relationship between the intensity of ongoing pain, disability, and sleep quality.Nineteen patients with mechanical neck pain (4 men, 15 women age, 40 Â± 16 yrs), 22 with WAD (4 men, 18 womenSignificant differences in sleep quality (P < 0.001), sleep latency (P = 0.005), sleep efficiency (P = 0.002), sleep disturbances (P < 0.001), use of sleeping medication (P < 0.001), daytime dysfunction (P < 0.001), and total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (P < 0.001) but not for sleep duration (P = 0.096) were found patients with mechanical neck pain and WAD pain exhibited higher scores in all components compared with healthy controls. Seventeen (77%) patients with WAD and 13 (68%) with mechanical neck pain reported poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, >8). Significant positive correlations between mean intensity of ongoing pain with sleep quality (r(s) = 0.693Sleep disturbances are a common finding in individuals with neck pain and are associated with the intensity of ongoing pain in WAD. It seems essential to address the ongoing cycle of pain and sleep disturbances as an integral part of the treatment of patients with neck pain.
