Iatrogenic esophageal perforation in the neonate. Esophageal perforation is uncommon and often iatrogenic.To report a neonatal case of esophageal perforation.A premature newborn boy was admitted with a diagnosis of oesophageal atresia after several unsuccessful attempts to insert an orogastric tube. A chest x-ray showed a "high pouch" with a gasless intestine. At operation, no atresia was found and a large traumatic perforation of the lower cervical segment was identified, requiring cervicotomy and primary closure. Oral feeding was started after 3 weeks. As a result, nosocomial sepsis occurred, causing death in the third month after surgical treatment.Oesophageal perforation in the neonate is often iatrogenic and may mimic oesophageal atresia. The authors highlight the importance of early diagnosis and management.
