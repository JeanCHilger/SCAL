Successful short-segment fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures using CYL-pedicle screw. To access the efficacy of posterior short-segment fixation for single level thoracolumbar burst fractures without spinal injury using CYL-pedicle screw.From September 2007 to December 2009, 74 cases who underwent posterior short-segment fixation for single level thoracolumbar burst fractures (Denis burst fracture type A, B, C) without spinal injury were analyzed retrospectively. There were 53 male and 21 female, mean age was (39 ± 15) years. Neither of them treated with direct decompression, grafting or fusion. Changes in the anterior vertebral height ratio, vertebral wedge angle, Cobb angle, regional angle were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, before implant removal, and at final follow-up to find the statistic difference. Pain status and work status were evaluated using Denis criterion. The incidence of incision infection, screw breakage, iatrogenic spinal injury were recorded as well.The time of follow-up was (20 ± 11) months, no significant change was noted in anterior vertebral height ratio and vertebral wedge angle (P > 0.05). A significant loss was noted in Cobb angle and regional angle, which were 9.8° ± 5.1° and 9.1° ± 4.8° respectively (t = 2.48 and 3.41, P < 0.05). Comparing with the patients with Cobb angle > 20°, the patients with Cobb angle ≤ 20° had better pain scale rate (χ(2) = 4.16, P = 0.04) and work scale rate (χ(2) = 24.34, P < 0.01). There were incision infection in 1 case, screw breakage in 1, screw loose in 1, and no iatrogenic spinal injury.CYL-pedicle screw could be successfully used in posterior short-segment fixation for single level thoracolumbar burst fractures without spinal injury based on radiographic and clinic outcomes.
