Radio-functional analysis of the cervical spine using the Arlen method. Part Three: Post-traumatic syndromes. A statistical analysis of 480 subjects. The purpose of this study was to determine the differences in patterns of cervical mobility diagrams obtained by the Arlen method in a control population of 240 subjects and in a group of 240 patients who had previously sustained an indirect cervical trauma. The characteristics of antero-posterior mobility of the cervical spine in the control population and their variations due to age and sex are summarized. A statistical study is devoted to the amplitudes of the different vertebral segments during flexion and extension. The authors have tried to elucidate the functional features of the injured spine in its totality and at different levels in both flexion and extension. The two groups were compared in an analysis of spinal dysfunctions (hypomobility, loss of mobility, paradoxical mobility).
