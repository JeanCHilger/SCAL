Spinal epidural abscess. Diagnosis of a case using nuclear magnetic resonance. This is a case study of a six year old boy with a previous history of a contuse trauma of the cervical spinal region who later developed fever, stiffening of the neck, and signs of spinal compression. A descending myelography detected a lesion at C4. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance study of the area showed an anterior epidural mass extending from C5 to T1 which displaced the spinal cord. Surgery revealed an epidural abscess which was drained. The patient received parenteral antibiotic therapy.
