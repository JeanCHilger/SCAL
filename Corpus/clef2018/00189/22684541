The role of embolization for hemangiomas. We retrospectively studied 31 patients with painful bone (15 patients) and soft-tissue (16 patients) hemangiomas treated with 39 embolizations using N-2-butyl cyanoacrylate from 2003 to 2010. The mean tumor size before embolization was 6 cm for bone and 7 cm for soft-tissue hemangiomas. The technique of embolization was the same for bone and soft-tissue lesions. Preoperative embolization was done in six patients, while the remaining patients had embolization as only treatment. The mean follow-up was 47 months (11-89 months). The clinical and imaging effect of treatment was evaluated at follow-up with a pain score scale, tumor size, and ossification. In four patients, embolization was not feasible because of the inability to catheterize and low blood flow of the feeding vessels. Nine patients with bone and 10 with soft-tissue hemangiomas experienced complete pain relief. Four patients with bone and four with soft-tissue hemangiomas experienced recurrence of pain and were treated with repeat embolization. Re-recurrences were not observed in any of the patients with soft-tissue hemangiomas until the period of this study. Ossification and tumor size reduction were higher for bone hemangiomas. Embolization-related complications were more common for soft-tissue hemangiomas.
