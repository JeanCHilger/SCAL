Risk factors of iatrogenic spinal cord injury in spinal surgery: a multicenter retrospective study. To investigate the risk factors of iatrogenic spinal cord injury (SCI) in spinal surgery.79 cases were abstracted according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, control cases were matched to patients abstracted by the ratio of 1:3. Unary and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to check out the risk factors of iatrogenic SCI and their strength associated with iatrogenic SCI.Age, gender, hypertension history, preoperative spinal cord function, and involved segments were risk factors of iatrogenic SCI. DM history and manifestation of MRI had little relativity with iatrogenic SCI.Surgeons should have knowledge of risk factors of iatrogenic SCI, and be more careful, strict, and cautious in operations, especially faced with high risk groups, in order to preventing patients from iatrogenic SCI in spinal surgery.
