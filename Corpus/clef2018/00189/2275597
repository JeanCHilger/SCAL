Variation of the transverse apophysis of the 7th cervical vertebra: anatomo-radiological study of an isolated population. The authors investigated the morphological changes in the transverse apophysis of C VII by Rx study on an isolated population. Two variations were mainly observed: the transverse mega-apophysis and the cervical rib. The authors found a remarkable incidence of variations, more than the average of the literature. Authors suppose that this results can be attributed at the geographical and economical isolation of the population and they hypothesize a genetic transmission of recessive autosomal type.
