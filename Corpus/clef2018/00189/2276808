Spinal injuries in children. We reviewed 47 children with spinal injuries. Three distinct patterns of injury were observed: subluxations and dislocations without a fracture (type 1), spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (type 2), and spinal fractures which may be associated with subluxation or dislocation (type 3). The neurological recovery was poor in complete lesions associated with type 2 injuries.
