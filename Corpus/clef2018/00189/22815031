Coexistence of occipital and infratorcular meningocele with cervical split cord anomaly. In this case report, we present an 18-year-old girl with occipital and infratorcular meningocele and coexisting split cervical cord. She had been admitted into the hospital for cosmetic considerations due to an inborn swelling in the back of the head and neck. Her mental status and neurologic examination were surprisingly intact. We discuss a very rare case of meningocele associated with split cord anomaly in the light of the current literature.
