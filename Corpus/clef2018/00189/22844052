CT scanning reduces the risk of missing a fracture of the thoracolumbar spine. The aim of this study was first, to determine whether CT scans undertaken to identify serious injury to the viscera were of use in detecting clinically unrecognised fractures of the thoracolumbar vertebrae, and second, to identify patients at risk of 'missed injury'.  We retrospectively analysed CT scans of the chest and abdomen performed for blunt injury to the torso in 303 patients. These proved to be positive for thoracic and intra-abdominal injuries in only 2% and 1.3% of cases, respectively. However, 51 (16.8%) showed a fracture of the thoracolumbar vertebrae and these constituted our subset for study. There were eight women and 43 men with mean age of 45.2 years (15 to 94). There were 29 (57%) stable and 22 (43%) unstable fractures. Only 17 fractures (33.3%) had been anticipated after clinical examination. Of the 22 unstable fractures, 11 (50%) were anticipated. Thus, within the whole group of 303 patients, an unstable spinal injury was missed in 11 patients (3.6%) no harm resulted as they were all protected until the spine had been cleared. A subset analysis revealed that patients with a high Injury Severity Score, a low Glasgow Coma Scale and haemodynamic instability were most likely to have a significant fracture in the absence of positive clinical findings. This is the group at greatest risk. Clinical examination alone cannot detect significant fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. It should be combined with CT imaging to reduce the risk of missed injury.
