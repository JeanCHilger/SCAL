Anterior plating of unstable cervical spine fractures. Medical records and radiographs of 16 patients who had anterior decompression, bone grafting, and plating of grade III and IV (Allen 1982) unstable cervical spine injuries were reviewed. Surgery was performed within 15 days of injury, reductions were achieved and maintained at follow-up, and fusion occurred in all cases. Neurologic function stabilised or improved in all cases. However, 3 patients (19%) had complications that necessitated additional surgery: one patient with undiagnosed non-contiguous posterior instability, and 2 patients for broken plates. These complications, in retrospect, could have been avoided.
