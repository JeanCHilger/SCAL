Analysis of image acquisition, post-processing and documentation in adolescents with spine injuries - comparison before and after referral to a university hospital. Systematic evaluation of imaging situation and standards in acute spinal injuries of adolescents.Retrospective analysis of imaging studies of transferred adolescents with spinal injuries and survey of transferring hospitals (TH) with respect to the availability of modalities and radiological expertise and post-processing and documentation of CT studies were performed. Repetitions of imaging studies and cumulative effective dose (CED) were noted.33 of 43 patients (77 %) treated in our hospital (MA 17.2 years, 52 % male) and 25 of 32 TH (78 %) were evaluated. 24-hr availability of conventional radiography and CT was present in 96 % and 92 % of TH, whereas MRI was available in only 36 %. In 64 % of TH, imaging expertise was guaranteed by an on-staff radiologist. During off-hours radiological service was provided on an on-call basis in 56 % of TH. Neuroradiologic and pediatric radiology expertise was not available in 44 % and 60 % of TH, respectively. CT imaging including post-processing and documentation matched our standards in 36 % and 32 % of cases. The repetition rate of CT studies was 39 % (CED 116.08 mSv).With frequent CT repetitions, two-thirds of re-examined patients revealed a different clinical estimation of trauma severity and insufficient CT quality as possible causes for re-examination. A standardization of initial clinical evaluation and CT imaging could possibly reduce the need for repeat examinations.
