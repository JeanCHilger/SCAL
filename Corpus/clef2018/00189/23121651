Spinal manifestations of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. The goal of the study was to elucidate the spinal manifestations of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.The authors reviewed the medical records and imaging studies of 338 consecutive patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who were evaluated at their institution between 2001 and 2010.Twenty patients (6% mean age 35.8 [range 16 to 60 years]Spinal manifestations are uncommon in cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, occurring in about 6% of patients, but myelopathy and radiculopathy involving all spinal segments do occur. Unlike the headache, the spinal manifestations usually are not positional and are caused by mass effect from an extradural CSF collection.
