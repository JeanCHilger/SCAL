Successful cranio-cervical fusion in a patient with Down syndrome. We present a patient with Down syndrome with neck pain and severe cervical myelopathy. Imaging revealed occipito-atlantal and atlanto-axial instability with severe spinal cord compression. There are no standardized radiological or clinical guidelines to aid in managing this unique subset of patients. We demonstrate a successful occiput-C3 internal fixation and fusion without complication. Due to the largely unknown natural history and ongoing management difficulties in this population, we demonstrate a case that may aid future decision making for this specialized field. We also discuss an approach to reduce this deformity, which, to our knowledge, has not been published before.
