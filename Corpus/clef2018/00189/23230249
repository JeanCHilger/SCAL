Remarkable recovery in an infant presenting with extensive perinatal cervical cord injury. Cervical-cord damage is a complication of a difficult delivery, and results in spinal shock with flaccidity progressing to spastic paralysis. Conventionally, outlook for such patients is extremely poor and most will recover only slightly from quadriplegia and autonomic dysfunction. Here, we report a case in which the extent of damage considerably contrasted with the outcome and recovery. A full-term baby girl born by difficult vaginal delivery displayed bilateral flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs with absent spontaneous movements, weakness of both upper limbs, hyporeflexia in all limbs and axial hypotonia. MRI of cervicothoracic spine exhibited raised signal intensity in the dorsal aspects of C7 to T1 signifying myelopathy. MRI at 4&emsp14months revealed a near-total transection of the cervical cord. However, at 6&emsp14
