Time-management study of trauma resuscitation. A prospective time-management analysis of trauma resuscitation (TR) of 431 patients arriving at a university trauma center documents timing and organization. Severity of injury, patient age, and potential airway injury were significant factors increasing the duration of TR up to a certain time (36 minutes). Moderately injured patients required less time (under 25 minutes). Patients needing emergent operations spent a minimal amount of time (20 minutes) in TR. Potential injuries involving the airway or cervical spine, or shock, added minutes. A review of the timing and organization of TR suggests the need for improvement in airway assessment and management. Patients with certain mechanisms of injury and elderly patients with blunt injuries required additional time in TR. With surgery faculty supervision and senior resident attendance, the month of resident experience had no effect on TR times. A timely and organized TR is critical to trauma care. TR times should be documented for quality assurance and ongoing review.
