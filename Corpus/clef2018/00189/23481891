Autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency in pediatric spinal cord injury. The purpose of this manuscript is to present a general overview and preliminary results of pilot projects of two complications in pediatric spinal cord injury (SCI): autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency.Retrospective cross-sectional investigations of blood pressures (BP), heart rates (HR), and vitamin D levels were performed.Among 279 children with SCI, it was observed that baseline BP increases and HR decreases with increasing age. Boys had higher systolic BP and girls had higher HR, but a gender difference in diastolic BP did not emerge. There were no significant associations of baseline BP or HR as a function of injury level, severity, or duration. Among 82 youth with SCI, 79% had vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. There were no differences in vitamin D status as a function of gender or level of injury. Adolescents, however, were more likely to exhibit deficiency compared to children.Because of the clinical significance of autonomic dysreflexia and orthostatic hypotension, baseline BP and HR need to be routinely assessed in youth with SCI. In view of the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in youth with SCI and the risk of complications such as pathological fractures, serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels should be routinely monitored.
