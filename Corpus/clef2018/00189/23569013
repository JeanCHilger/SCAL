Clinical application of olfactory ensheathing cells in the treatment of spinal cord injury. To investigate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of autologous olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation in cervical spinal cord injury (SCI).Patients with cervical SCI of >6 months' duration were treated with autologous OECs, injected into the area surrounding the SCI under magnetic resonance imaging guidance, twice a week for 4 weeks. Patients were evaluated before treatment and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment, using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, the ASIA sensory and motor score and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score.Eight patients were recruited to the study. Three months after treatment, ASIA and FIM scores had improved significantly compared with pretreatment, though by 1 year no further significant improvements in the ASIA score were seen. The return of substantial sensation and motor activity in various muscles below the injury level was observed in three patients during follow-up. In addition, bladder function was restored in two patients. There were no serious complications postoperatively or during the follow-up period.This study provides preliminary evidence of the safety and possible efficacy of autologous OEC transplantation.
