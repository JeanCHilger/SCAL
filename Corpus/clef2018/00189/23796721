Challenge of the management of severe trauma of cervical spine in sub-developed country. The management of cervical spine injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach based on emergency management and rehabilitation. In our context this chain fails, especially on the post-hospital care. Our goal is to explain the difficulties we had in the management of these patients in Dakar.This retrospective cohort study (2005-2009) included 99 patients admitted for severe cervical spinal cord injury in two hospitals in Dakar. The clinical signs, treatment and outcome were studied. The follow up was between 3 and 54 months.The average age of patients was 36.1 years and the traffic accidents were the main etiology (73.7%). Medical transport of patients was done in 65.7% with an admission average time of 64.86 hours. On admission, 57.6% of patients had Frankel score A or B. Dislocations (59.6%) and Tear drop fractures (16.2%) were the main lesions. The surgery was performed in 83.8% with a mean interval of 128.84 hours after the trauma. Outpatient rehabilitation was offered whatever the patient's neurological status. Recovery was complete in 20.2% and partial in 31.3% with a mortality rate of 37.4%. Most deaths occurred between 1 and 6 months (59.5%) mainly due to decubitus complications (56.8%).The efficacy of the management of severe spinal cord injuries is based on reducing the preoperative time and rehabilitation.
