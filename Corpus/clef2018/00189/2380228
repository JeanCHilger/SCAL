Spinal tuberculosis with neurological deficit. Treatment with anterior vascularised rib grafts, posterior osteotomies and fusion. Nineteen patients with thoracic or thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis and neurological deficits were treated by anterior debridement, decompression and vascularised rib grafting, followed, either during the same procedure or 14 days later, by multilevel posterior osteotomies, instrumentation and fusion. Surgery was performed under cover of four-drug antituberculosis chemotherapy, given for 12 months. The average pre-operative kyphotic angulation of 56 degrees was reduced to 27 degrees postoperatively and 30 degrees at the latest follow-up (3 degrees loss of correction). Radiological fusion between the vascularised rib graft and the vertebrae was seen after an average of 3.3 months. Eighteen patients (95%) had normal neurological function at 14 months, and the other could walk with the aid of crutches.
