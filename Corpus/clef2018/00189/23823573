Novel surgical classification and treatment strategy for atlantoaxial dislocations. Retrospective study of 904 patients with a diagnosis of atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD), using a novel surgical classification and treatment strategy.To describe a novel surgical classification and treatment strategy for AADs.AADs can result from a variety of etiologies, yet no comprehensive classification has been accepted that guides treatment. Because of the rarity of the cases, however, the treatment strategy has also been debated.During a period of 12 years, a total of 904 patients with a diagnosis of AAD were recruited from a single academic institution. According to the treatment algorithm that included preoperative evaluation using dynamic radiograph, reconstructive computed tomography, and skeletal traction test, the cases were classified into 4 types: I to IV. Types I and II were fused in the reduced position from a posterior approach. Type III, which were irreducible dislocations, were converted to reducible dislocations using a transoral atlantoaxial release, followed by a posterior fusion. Type IV presented with bony dislocations and required transoral osseous decompressions prior to posterior fusion.Four hundred seventy-two cases were classified as type I, 160 as type II, 268 as type III, and 4 cases as type IV. Follow-up was in the range of 2 to 12 years (average: 60.5 mo). Eight hundred and ninety-nine cases (99.4%) achieved a solid atlantoaxial fusion. Anatomic atlantoaxial reduction was achieved in 892 cases (98.7%), whereas 12 cases had a partial reduction. Neurological improvement was seen in 84.1% (512/609) of the patients with myelopathy. The overall complication rate was 9.1% (82/949).Our surgical classification and treatment strategy for AADs was applied in those 904 cases and associated with excellent clinical results with a minimal risk of complications.4.
