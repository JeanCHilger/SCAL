Clinical manifestation and neurosurgical intervention of encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis--a case report and review of the literature. Currently, there are only a few reported cases of symptomatic or asymptomatic subpial (intramedullary) spinal lipoma, and therefore no guidelines are available to indicate surgery. These lesions are infrequently associated with spina bifida.Herein, we provide our experience in the neurosurgical intervention of compressive myeloradiculopathy for encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL). The patient initially presented with bilateral upper hand paralysis, then regained muscle power after surgery and during 1 year of follow-up. We discuss the neurosurgical indications and intervention, imaging studies, other associated symptoms, and the pathogenesis of ECCL in an infant.
