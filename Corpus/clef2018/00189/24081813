Intravertebral pneumatocysts of the cervical spine. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of intravertebral pneumatocyst (IVP) of the cervical spine by age group, compared with that of intradiscal vacuum (IDV).We investigated 500 consecutive patients who underwent cervical computed tomography (CT) from May 2012 to May 2013 for various indications. CT datasets were assessed for the presence of IVPs and IDVs with stratification by age.IVPs of the cervical spine were detected in 8 % (7 of 86 subjects) of patients in their forties or below, 30 % (23 of 75) in their fifties, 49 % (67 of 136) in their sixties, 55 % (76 of 137) in their seventies, and 60 % (40 of 66) in their eighties or over. IDVs of the cervical spine were detected in 6, 25, 48, 54, and 57 %, respectively. Coexistence of both phenomena was identified in 4, 17, 33, 40, and 43 %, respectively.IVPs of the cervical spine are a common incidental finding, increasing in prevalence with age and more common than IDV in all age groups.
