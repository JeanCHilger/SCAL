The prevalence and clinical importance of incidental soft-tissue findings in cervical CT scans of trauma population. To define the age-related prevalence of incidental soft-tissue findings in cervical CT scans of a trauma population and to investigate their clinical importance.The original diagnostic radiology reports and the CT images of the 357 patients with cervical trauma were retrospectively evaluated. Incidental soft-tissue findings were investigated. All findings were grouped according to age. The findings were classified based on their clinical importance into three categories: Category 1: no clinical importance, Category 2: possible clinical importance requiring further investigation and Category 3: obvious clinical importance. In addition, the medical records of the patients were investigated. The follow-up ratio of the pathologies mentioned in the original radiology report was recorded.The most frequently encountered findings in Categories 2 and 3 were carotid artery calcification (n = 89, 24.9%) and tonsillolith (n = 115, 32.2%), respectively. The reporting ratio in the original reports of Categories 1, 2 and 3 findings was 1.1% (n = 4), 9% (n = 27) and 34.5% (n = 64), respectively. No further investigations and follow-up was accomplished for Category 1 lesions, whereas 11.1% of Category 2 and 35.9% of Category 3 lesions were subjected to further investigations and follow-up.The cervical CT scans of trauma patients reveal many clinically important soft-tissue incidental findings. Cervical region incidental findings may be followed up on an outpatient basis, rarely being of life-threatening value. The ratio of reporting and follow-up of incidental findings increases parallel to the clinical importance of the lesions.
