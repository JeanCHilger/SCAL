Outcomes of whole-body computed tomography in spinal cord-injured patients with sepsis. Retrospective case series.To evaluate the efficacy of body computed tomography (CT) in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with sepsis.Specialist acute care and rehabilitation SCI centre in United Kingdom.Patients with SCI and suspected or known sepsis, who had CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, over a 4-year period, were identified. Only patients who fulfilled the definition of sepsis or severe sepsis were included. Their medical notes and CT scans were reviewed and clinical outcomes and radiological findings recorded.Twenty-two patients with sepsis were identified including seven categorised as having severe sepsis. A specific radiological diagnosis was found in three patients (14%) and non-specific findings were found in 15 patients (68%).Although in the majority of cases, the findings were non-specific, a small number of patients had significant pathology identified by CT, which influenced their management significantly.
