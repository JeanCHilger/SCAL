Clinical application of anterior transpediclar screw reconstruction in treating lower cervical spine fracture and dislocation. To investigate the clinical effects of anterior transpediclar screw (ATPS) fixation in treating lower cervical spine fracture and dislocation.From January 2009 to December 2011, 18 patients with lower cervical spine fracture and dislocation were treated with ATPS technique, including 12 males and 6 females, aged from 17 to 47 years old with an average of 38.2 years. Severity score of lower cervical spine injuries (SLIC) ranged from 6 to 9 points with an average of 7.5 points. According to ASIA grade of spinal cord injury, 2 cases were classified in grade A, 8 cases in grade B, 6 cases in grade C and 2 cases in grade D. X-ray and CT scan were done after surgery in order to evaluate the safety of ATPS and observe the stability and fusion of injured segment. Spinal cord function was evaluated according to ASIA grade at 3 months after operation and last follow-up.All patients were followed up for 6 to 15 months with an average of 9.5 months. Three months after operation, in aspect of spinal cord function, 8 cases improved 1 grade, 2 cases improved 2 grades and at final follow-up, 7 cases improved 1 grade, 4 cases improved 2 grades. All patients obtained bony fusion 6 to 8 months after operation with an average of 6.5 months. After operation, 1 case had transient hoarseness and recovered 2 months laterAs for three columns injury caused by lower cervical spine fracture and dislocation, treatment with anterior transpediclar screw reconstruction can achieve the effect of decompression thoroughly and restore the cervical spine height and physiological curvature. Moreover, this kind of treatment has good stability and can create the favorable conditions for the recovery of spinal cord function.
