Pediatric thoracic spine injuries: a single-institution experience. The objective of our study was to determine the incidence of various fractures of the thoracic spine in pediatric patients.Simple compression and process-only fractures were the most common types of fractures and all other fracture types were infrequent. Distraction injury was unexpectedly more common in the nonjunctional thoracic spine than in the junctional thoracic spine.
