False-positive diagnosis of an odontoid fracture by CT scan. Although computed tomography (CT) is a valuable tool for evaluating spine trauma, it's usefulness is limited. Horizontally oriented fractures of the cervical spine, particularly type 2 fractures at the base of the odontoid process, may be difficult to detect with CT. Our case report illustrates a false-positive diagnosis of this fracture and suggests that conventional polytomography is superior to CT for demonstrating this particular lesion when minimal displacement is present.
