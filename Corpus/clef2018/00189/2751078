Non-fatal firearm injuries of the head and neck. There is depicted the evolutive course of 6 men with gunshot wounds of the neck and head, fortunately not threatening their lives. All victims were men between 18 and 67 years of age. Three times the gun fired a single projectile, whereas the other 3 were multiple projectiles. The latter cases resulted in heavier damages. Etiologically the events were classified as: 3 cases as suspected murder, 2 as attempted suicide and in the last case, an accident. The management has been both medical and surgical under general anesthesia, in order to repair the disorders and/or remove the bullets in 5 occasions. The sixth case did not allow removal of the bullet because of expected risk. All the cases did seemingly well, in spite of 2 who had postoperative complications which delayed healing.
