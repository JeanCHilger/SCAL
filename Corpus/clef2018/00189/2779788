A prospective study on acute spinal injuries. This work examines demographic and clinical characteristics of 163 consecutive cases of acute spinal injuries in a small area of Western Turkey, since 1982. These include all spinal injuries with or without neurological symptoms. Combined conservative and surgical methods were used for treatment. Age, sex, etiology, site of injury, radiologic findings, neurological status, and outcome are compared with the other studies. The results have been found to be parallel to those of the other studies except for some regional differences like an excess of tractor accidents.
