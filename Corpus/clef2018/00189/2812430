Fractures of the thoraco-lumbar spine with neurological deficits. We present 78 patients with spinal cord injuries. Operation is not indicated in cord contusion, extended bleeding into the spinal canal or severe fracture dislocation. However, it would seem advisable to operate on patients with vertebral fractures, particularly at the lower thoracic and lumbar levels, if intraspinal bone fragments are detected by CT scan.
