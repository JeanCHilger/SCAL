One-stage anterior cervical decompression and posterior stabilization with circumferential arthrodesis. A study of twenty-four patients who had a traumatic or a neoplastic lesion. Twenty-four patients had a combined anterior cervical decompression and posterior stabilization with circumferential spinal arthrodesis for treatment of either a tumor or an injury. The indication for operation was a fixed kyphosis and an incomplete neurological deficit or cervical instability. All but two patients had substantial improvement, having regained strength or had a reduction in the deformity, or both. The two exceptional patients, both of whom were quadriparetic, had no change. The operation is formidable and requires an average of 6.9 hours of general anesthesia however, its use is justified in patients who have the appropriate indications.
