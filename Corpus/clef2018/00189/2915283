Odontoid hypoplasia with vertebral cervical subluxation and ventriculomegaly in metatropic dysplasia. Our experience with 12 patients with metatropic dysplasia has demonstrated two important and treatable complications: odontoid hypoplasia with subluxation of the first and second cervical vertebrae, and ventriculomegaly. Hypoplasia and lack of ossification of the odontoid process were noted in all cases. Subluxation of these two vertebrae was demonstrated in all six patients who had lateral flexion-extension radiographs three had subluxation even in a neutral position, and sudden odontoid dislocation developed in another after a simple fall. Four individuals have had surgical fusion of the cervical vertebrae
