Neurologic diseases. The responses of apparently healthy newborn foals to neurologic testing differ significantly from those of adult horses. These responses and the diagnostic techniques pertinent to neurologic problems are reviewed as a basis for evaluation of the compromised neonatal foal. The more frequently encountered neurologic diseases are discussed in a problem-oriented format. These clinical problems include behavioral abnormalities, convulsions, changes in consciousness, blindness, ataxia without loss of strength, ataxia with weakness and paralysis, and the floppy foal.
