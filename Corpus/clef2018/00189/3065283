Osteoid osteoma of the spine. After reviewing the international literature the authors present three new cases of osteoid osteoma with vertebral body localisation, two in the lumbar region, and one in the cervical region. This rare localisation necessitates the use of accurate instrumental techniques, based on radiography, scintigraphy, and in particular, CT scanning, in order to arrive at a correct diagnosis as a prelude to the correct surgical treatment.
