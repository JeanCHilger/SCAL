Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of neurotrauma in New South Wales. This study of 1161 neurotrauma patients in New South Wales hospitals was designed to examine the role of preventable causes of death and disability in cases of spinal injury, extradural, subdural and multiple intracranial haematomas in order to make recommendations for improvements in accident, emergency, ambulance and hospital services. Methods have been developed for standardizing diagnosis in different classes of hospital for the assessment of severity in terms of the patient's age, sex, physical signs, head and spine injuries and other injuries. Estimates have been made of the number of preventable deaths by a case control study of each category of neurotrauma under study.
