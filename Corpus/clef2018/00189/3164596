Mandibular growth changes and maturation of cervical vertebrae--a longitudinal cephalometric study. The relationship of cervical vertebral maturation and mandibular growth changes are assessed in annual lateral cephalometric radiographs of thirteen caucasian females from 9 to 15 years of age. Statistically significant increases in mandibular length, corpus length and ramus height are associated with specific maturation stages in the cervical vertebrae.
