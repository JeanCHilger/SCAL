Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism with spinal cord compression. We describe a patient with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism who had an osseous tubercle on the anterolateral margin of the foramen magnum causing compression of the spinal cord. This patient had no evidence for any endocrinopathies and had no other spinal canal anomalies. We suggest that the morphologic phenotype found in patients with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, also known as Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, has an associated risk for spinal cord compression due to congenital vertebral anomalies. The poor recovery of neurologic function following spinal decompression mandates prompt recognition and therapy of this condition in patients with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.
