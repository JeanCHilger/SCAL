The neurological outcome following surgery for spinal fractures. Sixty consecutive patients with spinal injuries and encroachment upon the spinal canal of greater than 20% were assessed for neurological outcome. The patients were divided into two groups, those undergoing posterior surgery alone, and those undergoing anterior surgery for formal decompression with or without anterior or posterior instrumentation. In those patients undergoing posterior surgery, an improvement rate in the neurological function of 83% was noted in patients with incomplete lesions, whereas an 88% improvement rate was found in those undergoing the anterior procedure. There was no statistical difference in outcome between these two groups. Positive correlations were found between the level of injury and Frankel grades. The cord lesions tended to demonstrate more severe neurological deficit, whereas the cauda equina lesions were associated with a lesser severity of neurologic deficit. A component of dislocation to the injury also resulted in a more severe neurological deficit. There was no apparent difference between the degree of bony encroachment of the spinal canal and the initial Frankel grade, nor was there a clear difference between those patients undergoing anterior versus posterior surgery.
