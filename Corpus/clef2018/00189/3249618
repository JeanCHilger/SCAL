Aneurysmal cyst of the cervico-thoracic junction of the spine. The authors report an extensive aneurysmal cyst of the spine at the cervicothoracic junction. During the disease in the patient (a girl aged 9 years) high-grade tetraparesis developed (with complete paralysis of lower extremities but with spared deep sensation and retained sphincter control). In the treatment a two-stage operation with radical removal of the cyst from anterior and posterior approach, spondylodesis and radiotherapy gave very good results as compared with the very poor condition before the operation. Nearly complete movements of all extremities returned, superficial sensation loss regressed. The usefulness of surgical treatment even in such advanced cases is stressed. CT was very helpful in the assessment of the extent of the tumour and its growth rate.
