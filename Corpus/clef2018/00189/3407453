Neurological outcome after surgery for thoracic and lumbar spine injuries. New techniques for internal fixation, employed by neurosurgeons and orthopaedic surgeons, provide reduction and stabilization with early mobilization of patients after injuries of the thoracolumbar spine. It has, however, appeared difficult to prove that the neurological outcome after surgery may be superior to conservative treatment. In this study the neurological results after surgery are evaluated in 30 patients with injuries of the spinal cord and/or cauda equina. Canal encroachment was found on tomograms or CT in all patients. The unstable fractures, dislocations or fracture-dislocations were all reduced and stabilized by the Harrington distraction device. However, peroperative inspection revealed that the Harrington instrumentation alone may be inadequate in achieving intraspinal decompression. Additional anterior decompression by posterolateral approach was necessary in 13 of the 30 patients (43%). In this series there was an unexpectedly high rate of dural tears. These were found in 8 patients (27%) and nerve roots (cauda equina) appeared to have herniated through the tear in 6 of the 8 patients. Significant improvement of the neurological deficit was obtained in 22 of the 30 patients (73%), and the improvement rate in patients with incomplete lesions of the spinal cord was 83% (25 of 30 patients). In this series there was a definite trend toward greater neurological recovery when compared to the results obtained in patients treated conservatively. The importance of a neurosurgical approach in diagnosis and treatment of these patients is stressed.
