Cervical intervertebral disc calcification in children. Intervertebral disc calcification in children is a rare occurrence. The clinical symptoms and signs are distinctively confined to the cervical area with pain, limitation of motion, and torticollis. Long tract signs or radicular involvement are extremely unusual. CT scan and cervical spinal X-ray films shown the calcification to be in the nucleus pulposus with anterior or posterior mild protrusion into the spinal canal. Recovery without neurological sequelae is the rule in most of the pediatric cases with conservative treatment. Intervertebral disc calcification does not necessarily disappear with the onset of clinical symptoms. A case with persistent and even denser calcification at the same level of intervertebral disc space at the second episode of recurrence is illustrated.
