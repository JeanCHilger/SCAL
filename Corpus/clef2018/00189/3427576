Cervical lipoblastomatosis with intraspinal extension and transformation to mature fat in a child. Lipoblastomas are benign tumors of embryonic fat that occur in the pediatric population and may be infiltrating. We report the case of a mature intraspinal cervical lipoma in a 4-year-old girl who had undergone partial resection of a cervical lipoblastoma in infancy. The histology, differential diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of lipoblastoma are discussed.
