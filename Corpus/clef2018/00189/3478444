Problems in evaluation of penetrating foreign bodies with computed tomography scans: report of cases. Computed tomography is the best radiologic modality available in the evaluation of penetrating injuries to the soft tissues. The technique is the best available when the foreign body has a density similar to the surrounding tissues. Limitations of CT scanning include difficulty in identifying small foreign bodies, objects with densities similar to surrounding structures, and detecting vascular injury. Interpretation of postoperative changes is also difficult. Two cases have been presented to illustrate the advantages, and limitations of CT scanning in penetrating soft tissue trauma.
