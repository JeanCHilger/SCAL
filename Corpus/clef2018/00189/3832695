Cervical hemangioendothelioma in childhood. A report is given on the course of the disease in a 6.2-year-old girl with a cervical, histologically verified malignant haemangioendothelioma, who died two years after the appearance of the first symptoms. In connection with this case, the scarce information in the literature about this kind of tumour is analysed and differential diagnostic discussions of vascular tumours, such as the benign haemangioendothelioma, benign and malignant haemangiopericytoma, haemangioblastoma and angioblastic meningioma are presented.
