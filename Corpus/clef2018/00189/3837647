Characteristics of the tonic stretch reflex in spastic spinal cord and head-injured patients. Spasticity is a known sequelae of spinal cord injury and head injury. We sought to examine whether there were any significant differences in the characteristics or underlying mechanisms of spasticity in these two groups in the chronic period which may be related to the level of injury of the neuraxis. The response to vibration applied to the muscle, or the tonic vibratory reflex, has been shown to be related to the degree of spasticity, and was therefore studied along with phasic reflexes and passive movements. These studies were carried out on cooperative, stabilized patients who were otherwise healthy, 5 with head injuries, and 5 with spinal cord injuries. The patients were examined in a supine position while surface EMG recordings were made of quadriceps and triceps surae muscles bilaterally. Tendon jerk responses, passive and volitional movements, and responses to a powerful vibratory stimulator were measured. In both head injury and spinal cord injury patient groups, a large EMG response was elicited by passive maneuvers, and tendon jerks were exaggerated. The tonic vibratory response, previously shown to be dependent upon brain influence, was present in both groups. These observations suggest that similar suprasegmental mechanisms may be responsible for hypertonia in both head-injured and spinal cord-injured patients.
