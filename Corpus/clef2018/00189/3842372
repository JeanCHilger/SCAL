Circadian desynchronization in pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, rectal temperature and urine output in traumatic tetraplegics. An investigation was undertaken to study the circadian rhythmicity in pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, rectal temperature and urine output in eight traumatic tetraplegics in view of the fact that diurnal rhythmicity in prolactin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone was absent in such patients. The data, analysed by single cosinor procedure, showed absence of rhythmicity in all five parameters. Analysis of variance also showed no significant difference in these parameters at various time points. Knowledge of the alterations in circadian biology subsequent to cervical spinal cord trauma would provide useful guidelines towards chronotherapy and vocational rehabilitation of tetraplegics besides possible restoration of euchronism by pharmacological means.
