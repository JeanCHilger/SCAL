Ultrasonic evaluation of the urinary tract in patients with spinal cord injuries. Systematic comparison with intravenous urography in 50 cases. Intravenous urography and ultrasonography were performed routinely, and at the same time, in 50 patients with spinal cord injuries, to compare diagnostic efficacy. Ultrasound was found to be as reliable as intravenous urography in 92% of renal and bladder explorations and to supply additional data on these regions in 6% of cases. It was also found to be equally effective for ureteral dilatation cases, although the site and nature of the obstacle could not be established except in 66% of patients. Ultrasound imaging should therefore play an important role in the urologic surveillance of these patients.
