Injuries of the cervical spine in high school wrestling. Severe injuries to the cervical spine and spinal cord have been widely reported from many causes: automobile accidents, diving mishaps, falls, and contact sports. This paper concerns three young men who sustained severe trauma to the cervical spine and spinal cord during high school wrestling. Certain head-holds are prone to cause such injuries. Their tetraparesis and tetraplegia were reversed by reducing the fracture-dislocation and internal stabilization, in one case by decompressive laminectomy when no bony disruption was encountered. Their recoveries were satisfactory, but prevention of these cervical injuries may be accomplished by elimination of the more dangerous holds in wrestling.
