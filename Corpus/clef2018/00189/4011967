Vertebral osteoid osteoma. Diagnostic problems apropos of 3 cases. One osteoblastoma and two osteoid osteomata were seen in cervical, dorsal and lumbar spines. In the three cases, the diagnosis was made by scintigraphy. In one case, a tomodensitometric (C.A.T.) scan was negative. In two cases the patients had been previously referred to Psychiatrists and in one case there was a painful scoliosis. A review of the literature was made. The value of scintigraphy is considerable and tomodensitometry allows a better localisation of the lesion. Complete excision has led to a complete cure in all cases. In one case, resection of the isthmus led to hypertrophy of the opposite isthmus.
