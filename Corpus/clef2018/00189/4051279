Air gun injuries in children. Air gun injuries occur frequently in children and are potentially lethal. Three cases of air gun injuries in children are described. Two children sustained air gun injuries to the neck that penetrated the platysma. Each had exploration of the wound. One had injury to the esophagus that was treated with external drainage the other sustained no major injury to vital cervical structures. A third child received a penetrating injury to her right flank that did not appear to enter the peritoneal cavity. She was observed for 24 hours and released. After a six-month followup, all patients have remained free of complications. The emergency physician should be aware of the penetrating capabilities of these weapons, and they should be managed as would any other low-velocity gunshot wound.
