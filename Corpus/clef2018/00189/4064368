Lethal and non-lethal diastrophic dysplasia. A study of 14 Swedish cases. A clinical study was performed on 14 patients with diastrophic dysplasia (DD), including three pairs of sibs. Six of these patients, including two pairs of sibs, died shortly after birth of respiratory and circulatory insufficiency. We consider these six patients to represent a special lethal variant of DD. In all infants with the lethal variant of DD the birth weight was lower than in those with the non-lethal variant. There were also roentgenological differences between these two groups. Overlapping in joints and dislocation of the cervical spine were seen in all the lethal cases. In addition, four of the six patients with lethal DD cases had a congenital heart defect, and none in the non-lethal group.
