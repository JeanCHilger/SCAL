Laminar avulsion in a cervical vertebra. An unusual avulsion fracture involving the lamina of a cervical vertebra, most likely due to tear of a ligamentum flavum, is described. Its radiographic features may be quite subtle. Simulation of this fracture on dried skeleton allowed a better understanding of its appearance on the standard projections, its mechanism of occurrence, and its delayed recognition on the patient's anteroposterior view. Only awareness of the existence of this type of fracture and special efforts directed toward its detection will determine its true frequency.
