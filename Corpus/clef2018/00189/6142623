A rare form of open spinal cord injury. By means of an injury of the spinal cord by a glass fragment in a 13-year old boy the problems of operative treatment of penetrating spinal cord wounds are represented. Provided that spinal computer tomography and microsurgical operative techniques are available, penetrating spinal cord injuries should be treated surgically after spinal cord edema has disappeared. By this means secondary infections, meningoceles, and adhesions of the spinal cord to the scar tissue can be prevented.
