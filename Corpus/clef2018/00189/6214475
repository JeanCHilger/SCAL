The course of atlanto-axial involvement and disc narrowing of the cervical spine in rheumatoid arthritis. In 188 patients with rheumatoid arthritis 585 radiological examinations of the cervical spine were performed. Subluxation of C1-2 was found more often than expected it was often the only radiological change in that segment, and its degree was not related to the duration of the disease. Lateral radiographs taken in full flexion were important for the diagnosis. Age over 40 years at the onset of RA, increased ESR at least on one occasion and seropositivity were related to more severe degrees of involvement. The presence of subcutaneous nodules, high titres of the Rose-Waaler reaction and the presence of antinuclear antibodies had no definite relation to the degree of involvement.
