Football head and neck injuries--an update. In the last 5 years there has been a dramatic decrease in the deaths directly related to football participation. The incidence of serious spinal cord injuries, however, appears to be increasing. The number of quadriplegic athletes varies from an estimated 1 per 7,000 to 1 per 58,000 participants per year in different areas of the country. The majority of catastrophic head and neck injuries occurs while tackling or blocking, and defensive players are much more liable to sustain these injuries than offensive players. In addition to permanent and irreversible spinal cord damage, football players may suffer spinal concussions as well as spinal contusions. The latter may be manifested by severe burning paresthesias and dysesthesias in the extremities as the only symptoms. Furthermore, fracture-dislocations with ligamentous tears may be present in this syndrome, with no complaint of cervical pain. Adequate preconditioning and strengthening of the head and neck musculature prior to football participation are essential for the prevention of catastrophic head and neck injury. Furthermore, proper blocking and tackling techniques must be taught, and such punishing maneuvers as spearing, goring, and butt-blocking and tackling must be eliminated. Arbitrarily, most physicians discourage further football participation if an athlete has suffered three cerebral concussions. Strong consideration must be given, however, not only to the number and severity of the concussion, but also to any CAT scan evidence of cerebral edema, contusion, or hemorrhage. With this incredibly sensitive diagnostic tool, one concussion, which is associated with radiographic evidence of structural brain damage, may be enough to strongly discourage or forbid further football participation.
