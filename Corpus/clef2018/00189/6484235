Computerized tomography in the diagnosis of a herniated cervical disk . A total number of 117 cervical herniated disks was observed in 103 patients. Among these, 30 underwent surgical treatment. A comparison is made between CT findings and myelographic and surgical data. Purpose of the investigation is to define the reliability of CT in the diagnosis of cervical herniated disk. The morphology, level and tomographic localization into the vertebral canal are described. Moreover the possible association with spondylosis and "narrow canal" is stressed. The diagnosis was correct in all operated cases (100%). The topographic description too was correct in all cases. In 3 patients the level-diagnosis was mistaken. CT shows a higher degree of sensibility and specificity than myelography in the diagnosis of herniated disk in the cervical spine.
