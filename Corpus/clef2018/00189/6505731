Normal thermographic standards for the cervical spine and upper extremities. Although thermography has been used for a variety of abnormal conditions, extensive data on large, relatively asymptomatic populations has heretofore not been available. More specifically, no data deal with the upper extremities and, more particularly, no analyses are based on simultaneous thermograms of the posterior neck and shoulders. The current study undertook this task. The results confirm the existence of thermal symmetry in the overwhelming majority of 100 normal relatively asymptomatic, actively employed factory workers. Conversely, if persistent, statistically significant thermal asymmetry exists, as outlined and correlates with patient symptomatology, an organic basis for it should be sought.
