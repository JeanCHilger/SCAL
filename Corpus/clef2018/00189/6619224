Cervical spine injuries in children. Cervical spine injuries in children are usually benign, severe traumatism being exceptional. The authors report 4 observations of severe traumatisms, 2 of which have required surgical treatment. Moreover they insist on the interest of acupuncture in the treatment of torticollis and of pain in the cervical spine after injury. The authors also point out the frequent aspect of anterior pseudo-subluxation C2-C3 which corresponds to a genuine medio-cervical physiological hinge.
