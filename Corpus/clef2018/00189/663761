Vertebra plana and eosinophilic granuloma of the cervical spine in children. Eosinophilic granuloma of the cervical spine in children is a rare lesion which presents both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. The report describes three additional cases. Open biopsy is recommended instead of attempted needle aspiration in children. Laminectomy is likely to result in spinal deformity, and is not advised unless a second stage fusion is planned. Radiotherapy is effective in controlling the lesion. The ultimate outcome is usually good.
