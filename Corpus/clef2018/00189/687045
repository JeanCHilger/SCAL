Secondary spinal lesions in spinal cord injury patients. On hospital admission, 6 spinal cord injured patients were noted to have second noncontiguous levels of spinal injury that were previously unrecognized. These secondary levels of spinal injury were diagnosed as a result of routine admission total spine radiographic examinations. Two cases are described in detail, one with the secondary spinal lesion above and the other below the primary spinal cord injury. Careful total spine radiographic studies are recommended to prevent complications, in the event that such lesions are initially unrecognized.
