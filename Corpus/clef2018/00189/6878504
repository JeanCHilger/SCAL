Roentgenologic diagnosis of the cervical spine in childhood. The degree of lordosis and mobility of the cervical spine, the "formation of steps" at the top end of the cervical spine, the Atlas-Dens distance, the diameter of the bony cervical spine canal and the breadth of the retropharyngeal and retrotracheal space were measured on 360 lateral radiograms of the cervical spine in the median position, at maximum flexion and maximum extension. The subjects were 120 children aged three to 14 years. The discussion of the results draws attention to their practical value and to the importance of functional radiographical examination of the cervical spine during childhood.
