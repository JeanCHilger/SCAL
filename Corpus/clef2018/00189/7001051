Effects of dimethyl sulfoxide on renal function in man. To ascertain the clinical significance of dimethyl sulfoxide-induced pigmenturia, we evaluated renal function and indicators of systemic hemolysis in stable quadriplegic patients receiving the drug intravenously (IV) for spinal cord injury. Despite a dose-dependent transient hemolysis with resultant hemoglobinuria, no alteration of renal function could be appreciated. Other than the presence of urinary hemoglobin, there were no changes from baseline in the urinary sediment and all patients remained without severe hematuria. Our results indicate that patients treated with IV dimethyl sulfoxide for severe cerebral edema could serve as donors for renal transplantation.
