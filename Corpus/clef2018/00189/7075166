Computed tomography in tuberculosis of the spine. In a study of the CT appearance of 30 patients with confirmed tuberculosis of the spine, criteria for the diagnosis of tuberculosis of the spine are suggested. From a comparison with plain radiographs it is concluded that bony lesions are more apparent on radiographs than on CT while soft tissue lesions and calcifications are more readily detected on CT. The value of CT in cases who may come to surgery is discussed.
