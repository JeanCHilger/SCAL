CT for trauma to the base of the skull and spine in children. Five patients have been selected to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of CT in cases of traumatic damage to the base of the skull and spine in infants and children. Ct is superior to any other diagnostic radiological technique as bone and soft tissues are usually equally well demonstrated during one visit to the Radiology Department. Thus, CT is considered to be the primary investigative procedure of choice to evaluate trauma of the base of the skull and spine in infants and children.
