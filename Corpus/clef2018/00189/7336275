Spinal fractures and dislocations in children and adolescents. During the years 1962 through 1978 a total of 42 children under the age of 15 years with fractures or dislocations of the spine were admitted to the Royal Brisbane Hospital Complex. Sixty-three percent of these children were males. The predominate causes of injury were fall/jump (40%), road traffic accidents (29%), and water-related injuries (19%). Half the injuries occurred to the cervical spine, while injuries at more than one level occurred in 35% of patients. Cord injuries occurred in 14% of patients, while skeletal and head injuries occurred in over half of the spinal injuries associated with road trauma. The response of the immature spine following trauma differs from that of the adult, especially in respect to a growth potential, ultimate vertebral stability, and neurologic function.
