The spinal cord compression syndrome in children with mediastinal neuroblastoma. The authors present 5 cases of mediastinal neuroblastoma in children with the syndrome of medullar compression. The problems of the diagnosis, the treatment and the prognosis are discussed. The attention is called to the rapidity of neurological signs progression and the diagnostic significance of cerebro-medullar fluid and radiological examinations (thoracic and vertebral X-rays and myelography). The necessity to decompression (laminectomy) as quick as possible is underlined. The authors indicate that these cases must be evaluated and treated in the complex way and the tumour advancement, neurological disorders, appropriate orthopedic supplies and rehabilitation must be considered respectively. The serious prognosis, especially in children above one year of life, is emphasized.
