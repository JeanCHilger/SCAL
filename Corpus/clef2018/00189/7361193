Spinal cord trauma in children. Neurologic patterns, radiologic features, and pathomechanics of injury. There is considerable confusion and controversy regarding the incidence of radiologic abnormalities, prognosis, and pathomechanics of spinal cord injuries in children. The comparison of mechanisms of injury, severity of trauma, methods of management, and outcome has been very difficult because some authors have used 12 years as the upper age limit, while others have included patients as old as 18 years. This article critically analyzes the neurologic patterns of injury, radiologic features, management, outcome, and pathomechanics in 97 children whose acute spinal cord injury was managed and followed at The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research. Pertinent literature on the subject is also extensively reviewed.
