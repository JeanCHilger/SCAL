Cervical myelography with metrizamide (Amipaque). A comparison between conventional and computer-assisted myelography with special reference to the upper cervical and foramen magnum region. Cervical myelography with metrizamide was performed in a series of 30 patients. Minor modifications to the conventional technique made it possible to carry out measurements of the sagittal diameter of the cord and to improve the opacification of the upper cervical--foramen magnum region. Computer tomography was performed with a head scanner within 1 h after the conventional examination, and the spinal cord surrounded by contrast  medium was shown from C-3 to the foramen magnum region. Measurements of the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal and the cord at corresponding levels using the two methods showed good correlation.
