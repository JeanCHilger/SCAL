Penile erection following complete spinal cord injury in man. Three types of erection following complete spinal transection (at lower thoracic or thoracolumbar levels) in man are described. Reflex erection involves both corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum if the lower level of cord injury or lesional sector (LLLS) is cranial to T10/12, and involves only corpus cavernosum if the LLLS is caudal to T12/L2. Psychogenic erection may occur when the upper level of cord injury or lesional sector (ULLS) is caudal to T12 and when testicular sensation is normal. A mixed erection can occur when the ULLS is caudal to T10/12 and the LLLS cranial to S2.
