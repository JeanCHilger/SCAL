Penetrating injuries of the neck: a prospective study of 108 patients. One hundred and eight patients were admitted to King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, with a penetrating wound of the neck and were managed by a conservative policy. Intervention was undertaken if, and only if, there was an indication of damage to deep structures. Data were collected prospectively. Significant sequelae were seen in only 50 patients (46 per cent) and 26 underwent surgery. Three patients died from their neck injuries (2.8 per cent). 2 after operative intervention and 1 after conservative management. Morbidity was higher after surgery, though local sepsis in wound haematomas was more common in those treated conservatively. A selective policy for surgical intervention is safe and justifiable. A minimum mortality and morbidity can be obtained by adequate preoperative evaluation which includes the use of contrast radiography and angiography.
