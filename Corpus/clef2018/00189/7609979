Transpedicular fixation of the lumbar and lumbosacral spine with screws. Application of the Diapason system. Forty-six patients with the Diapason transpedicular screw system for lumbar and lumbosacral fusions were analysed clinically. No implant breakage was observed, but one rod migrated. Additional sacral screws different in the length of the threaded portion are necessary in this system. Metallosis was noted in a few cases, but posed no significant clinical problems. This system, which is simple in structure, easy to use, and applicable to magnetic resonance scanning after surgery, is considered to be a useful instrumentation.
