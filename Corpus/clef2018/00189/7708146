Management of the vertebral artery in excision of extradural tumors of the cervical spine. Extradural tumors of the cervical spine may involve the vertebral artery on one or both sides, posing one of the limiting factors toward the radical resection of such neoplasms. A standard anterior approach may be inadequate for the management of such tumors. An anterolateral approach allows the dissection and mobilization of the vessel, which can then be preserved, resected, or reconstructed with a vein graft. An anterior approach can be supplemented with this for tumor resection and stabilization. This management strategy is described in 10 patients with a variety of tumors.
