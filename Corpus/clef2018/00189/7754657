Complete synostosis of the cervical spine at a young age. A thus far unpublished disease. A case of complete synostosis of the cervical spine in a 12-year-old girl is described. Differential diagnosis included dysontogenetic forms of synostosis, Klippel-Feil syndrome, rheumatic synostosis and synostosis of other inflammatory origin. This severe case, the first of its type to be described, appeared to be due to tuberculosis of the cervical spine.
