A comparison of the chest radiograph and computerised tomography in assessing lung changes in acute spinal injuries--an assessment of their prevalence and the accuracy of the chest X-ray compared with CT in their assessment. Lung function in patients following an acute spinal injury is frequently much more compromised than may be expected from the level of injury and the chest radiograph appearance. Experimental evidence in anaesthetised patients and subsequently our own experience with patients with acute spinal injuries suggested that in paralysed patients lung changes were frequent and that in many spinal patients large pleural effusions and lung consolidation could be present without the usual associated chest radiograph changes being recognised. This study was performed to assess the prevalence of chest pathology and the sensitivity of the chest radiograph in portraying it. Sixty patients (50 males, 10 females, 31 cervical, 29 thoracic or thoracolumbar 15 incomplete, 45 complete
