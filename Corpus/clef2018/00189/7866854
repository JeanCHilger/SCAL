Klippel-Feil anomaly combined with fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol is the most frequent and most important teratogenic noxa for the embryo and fetus. It may lead to deformation of all cells and organs. A case of Klippel-Feil anomaly associated with fetal alcohol syndrome is described. The diagnosis of Klippel-Feil anomaly, even a late diagnosis made on the basis of rare deformities, is very important as the affected patients are at a high risk of alcoholism. The combination of Klippel-Feil anomaly with numerous other syndromes and deformities suggests a basic general disorder of skeletal maturation. Diverse cases of Klippel-Feil anomaly possibly originate, in reality, in an unrecognized fetal alcohol syndrome.
