Massive steroids do not reduce the zone of injury after penetrating spinal cord injury. The National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study II concluded in 1990 that high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) improved neurologic recovery after acute spinal cord injury (ASCI). We tested this conclusion by analysis of 54 patients with ASCI 25 patients were treated without MP before 1990 whereas 29 patients were treated with MP after 1990. Neurologic deficit was assessed regularly, in most cases daily. Motor and sensory scores on admission, and best results at one-half week (days 2 to 4), 1 week (days 6 to 10), 2 weeks (days 11 to 21), 1 month, and 2 months were noted for both groups. Motor assessment was recorded in 22 muscle segments on a scale of 0 (complete deficit) to 5 (normal)
