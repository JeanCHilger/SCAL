The safety of emergency neuromuscular blockade and orotracheal intubation in the acutely injured trauma patient. This study was done to determine the safety and success of orotracheal intubation with planned neuromuscular blockade in patients who are severely injured. The study was performed at Carle Foundation Hospital, designated Level I trauma center located in east central Illinois.A retrospective review of the trauma registry and medical records of all patients requiring emergency airway control from September 1, 1987 to September 30, 1991 was performed. Two hundred twenty-nine patients who were critically injured were reviewed, the mean injury severity score was 29 (range of 3 to 75), the mean revised trauma score was 9 (range of 3 to 12), the mean Glasgow Coma Scale was 9 (range of 3 to 15), and the mean age was 31 years (range of one to 94 years).Indications for intubation included hemodynamic instability or altered level of consciousness (66.4 percent), or both, combative or uncooperative behavior (33.2 percent), and need to secure airway for transport (0.4 percent). Two hundred twenty-three (97.4 percent) patients were successfully intubated. Six (2.6 percent) patients required cricothyroidotomy and one (0.4 percent) patient was aspirated during intubation. Eight (3.5 percent) patients had cervical spine injuries but had no complications from orotracheal intubation. In the combative group, 32 (42 percent) patients had significant head injuries and 17 (22 percent) had other potentially life-threatening injuries.Orotracheal intubation with planned neuromuscular blockade and in-line cervical traction is a safe, effective method for airway control in patients who are severely injured. This technique is also indicated to expedite therapy in combative, uncooperative patients because of the high incidence of significant life-threatening injuries to the brain and other organs.
