Magnetization transfer contrast imaging of the cervical spine at 0.3 T. We assessed the efficacy of magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) imaging of the cervical spine in conjunction with a gradient recalled echo (GRE) technique using a 0.3 T permanent magnet imager.Seventy patients were prospectively investigated. Multislice sagittal and axial images of the cervical spine with and without MTC were obtained using a GRE sequence (TR/TE/flip angle = 750 ms/23 ms/25 degrees). The contrast-to-noise ratios (C/Ns) for CSF versus cord or disk were calculated for quantitative analysis. Qualitative image analysis was also performed.Both sagittal and axial MTC images had significantly higher C/N values than conventional GRE images. The MTC images showed better differentiation between the CSF and the cord or thecal sac as well as better delineation of the nerve roots. Furthermore, MTC images demonstrated syringomyelia more clearly than conventional images.Magnetization transfer contrast images at 0.3 T are effective for diagnosing diseases of the cervical spine.
