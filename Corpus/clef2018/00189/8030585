Disc space infection. Disc space infection or discitis, an infection of the intervertebral disc with contiguous subchondral vertebral osteomyelitis, most frequently follows prior intervertebral disc surgery or arises by hematogenous dissemination. The majority of cases are located in the lumbosacral spine and are caused by staphylococci. Clinical findings include localized spinal pain and fever. The diagnosis is suggested by radiologic studies (plain x-ray, bone scan, CT scan and MR imaging) and confirmed by culturing blood or material obtained from the involved disc space. Treatment consists of antimicrobial therapy, spinal immobilization and surgical intervention in selected circumstances. Discitis is associated with a good prognosis but residual back pain, limited spinal mobility and neurologic deficit may occur.
