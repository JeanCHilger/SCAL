Otoneurological evaluation in patients with Arnold-Chiari malformation and various ossicular changes in cranial vertebral unity. The union between the inferior portion of the occipital bone and the first two cervical vertebrae is the site of osseous and neurological abnormalities responsible for a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms of otoneurological interest. Often symptoms are vague with an evolution marked by temporary exacerbation or remission. The diagnosis can be difficult, and in our experience is best achieved by combining neurotologic and neurologic evaluation. We discuss the diagnosis of 6 patients with lesions at the craneovertebral junction. Arnold-Chiari malformation was diagnosed most frequently.
