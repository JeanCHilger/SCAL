Technique of reduction and internal fixation of thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation using pedicle screws and variable screw placement plates. Spinal column injuries to the thoracolumbar region are common and leave one fifth of patients with neurological deficit. The authors describe a case of complete fracture-dislocation at lumbar 1-2 level with paraplegia. They detail their surgical technique for reduction, stabilization, and fusion using pedicle screws and plates. Surgical management of such injuries allows rapid rehabilitation of patients with spinal column injuries.
