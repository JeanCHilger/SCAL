Neurological recovery after conservative treatment of cervical cord injuries. We reviewed a series of 53 patients with closed traumatic complete injuries of the cervical spinal cord. They were admitted within two days to a spinal injuries centre, treated conservatively by six weeks of bedrest and skull traction, then mobilised in a neck support for six weeks. Eight patients had temporary neurological deterioration, four spontaneously and four after cervical manipulation seven of these recovered to the initial neurological level without surgery. Of 40 patients followed for more than 12 months, 19 recovered useful motor power in local muscles which were initially paralysed (zonal recovery)
