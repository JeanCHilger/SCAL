Larsen's syndrome: review of the literature and analysis of thirty-eight cases. Thirty-eight cases of Larsen's syndrome in patients living on Reunion Island were analyzed, with an average follow-up of 13 years. Fourteen of these patients died of early complications secondary to dislocation of the cervical spine, tracheomalacias, heart disease, and severe respiratory infection. These children pose a problem of planning early treatment. Clubfeet must be treated conservatively early, and operation should be postponed until after knee deformities are corrected by plaster cast and/or early operation. Unilateral hip dislocations should be treated surgically in the second year of life. Treatment of bilateral hip dislocations is best neglected. Finally, the spinal status of these children must be monitored throughout their life.
