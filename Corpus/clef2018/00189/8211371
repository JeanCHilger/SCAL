Cervical spondylolysis. Report of two cases. Two cases of cervical spondylolysis are presented. Both cases were discovered during radiographic examination after incidental trauma. The first patient experienced transient quadriplegia that spontaneously resolved and the other experienced only neck pain. Further radiographic evaluation of the first patient revealed significant spinal cord compromise, ultimately requiring decompression and fusion. The second patient's cervical spine proved stable to dynamic studies and was without cord compromise.
