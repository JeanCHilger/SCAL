A new management approach to decompression, posterior stabilization, and fusion for cervical laminar exostosis with cord compression in a case of diaphyseal aclasis. Case report and review of the literature. A rare case of cervical cord compression secondary to laminar exostosis (in an adolescent girl with diaphyseal aclasis) is described, which was treated by decompression, posterior stabilization by a Hartshill rectangle, and posterolateral facet fusion. A brief summary of the clinical presentation is given as well as the surgical technique employed and a brief review of the relevant literature. Posterior stabilization and posterolateral fusion are emphasized, with a view to minimize the inevitable "postlaminectomy kyphosis." This is the first report of such an aggressive treatment protocol even described for a similar lesion.
