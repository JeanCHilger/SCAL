10-year follow-up of C3-C7 cervical laminectomy for intramedullary grade I astrocytoma. In an eight years old boy we operated an intramedullary astrocytoma grade I and reimplanted the laminae C4-7 en bloc. A good stability was achieved. Ten years later only one segment remained intact, the others showing spontaneous fusion as a major draw back. This is possibly due to subperiostal dissection and bracing. No spinal stenosis occurred. An overuse of the remaining disc C4/5 might lead to a secondary degenerative stenosis. The operation is simple and might avoid swan neck deformity in children after large decompression of dorsal structures.
