Cervical myelomeningoceles. Cervical myelomeningoceles are rare dysraphic lesions. Nine cases of cervical myelomeningoceles are reported. The external features of all nine myelomeningoceles were strikingly similar: They were sturdy, tubular protuberances from the back of the infants' necks, covered at the base by full-thickness skin and covered on the dome by thick squamous epithelium. Internally, these were tethered cord lesions in which fibroneural bands or sagittal midline fibrous septa were tightly tethering the cervical spinal cord to the adjacent dural or intrasaccular soft tissues. Six of our early cases (Group 1) were initially treated with simple subcutaneous resection of the sac and ligation of the dural fistula without release of the internal tethering structures. Five of these children subsequently deteriorated 13 months to 8 years later, all with worsening hand function and spastic legs. All five were reexplored, and the tethering bands and septa were excised all showed improvement. The other three neonates (Group 2) treated in the last 4 years underwent initial intradural exploration of the lesions
