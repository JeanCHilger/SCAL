Harrington instrumentation and spine fusion for unstable fractures and fracture-dislocations of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Of forty patients with unstable fractures and fracture-dislocations of the thoracic or lumbar spine treated with Harrington instrumentation and spine fusion, thirty-five had a neural deficit (twenty-three with incomplete or cauda equina lesions and twelve with complete lesions). Laminectomy or posterolateral decompression was performed prior to instrumentation and fusion in twenty-three patients and at the time of stabilization, in thirteen. Solid fusion was obtained in all but one patient. Back pain persisted in four. No patient had residual spinal deformity. Twenty-one patients with incomplete or cauda equina lesions regained some neural function, while all twelve with complete lesions remained unchanged. The advantages of this technique include effective stabilization of the spine, early mobilization and rehabilitation, and prevention of late deformity.
