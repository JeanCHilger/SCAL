Spinal considerations in the young athlete. The young athlete involved in modern sports activity may be subject to considerable problems involving the spine. An appreciation of the differences in spinal anatomy, development, and kinematics facilitates the evaluation of each individual. While a variety of factors are operant that could contribute to difficulty in evaluation and treatment, an organized approach with an emphasis on naturally-occurring variations of the immature spine will allow for appropriate recommendations. While concern exists regarding the individual with congenital, developmental, or hereditary conditions, it is important to respect the individuality of these young athletes and to assess each problem in a comprehensive manner before recommending full or restricted activity. Current research should yield important information that will serve as more absolute guidelines in formulating recommendations for involved adolescent athletes and will establish the natural history of conditions that today remain obscure.
