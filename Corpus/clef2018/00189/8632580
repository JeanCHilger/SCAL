Results of the treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in spinal cord injury by sacral posterior root rhizotomy and anterior sacral root stimulation. We evaluated the results of treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in spinal cord injury by sacral posterior root rhizotomy and anterior sacral root stimulation using the Finetech-Brindley stimulator.In 52 patients with spinal cord lesions and urological problems due to hyperreflexia of the bladder complete posterior sacral root rhizotomy was performed and a Finetech-Brindley sacral anterior root stimulator was implanted. All patients were evaluated and followed with a strict protocol. A minimal 6-month followup is available in 47 cases.Complete continence was achieved in 43 of the 47 patients with 6 months of followup. A significant increase in bladder capacity was attained in all patients. Residual urine significantly decreased, resulting in a decreased incidence of urinary tract infections. In 2 patients upper tract dilatation resolved. In 3 patients rhizotomy was incomplete and higher sectioning of the roots was necessary. One implant had to be removed because of infection.The treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in spinal cord injury by anterior sacral root stimulation with the Finetech-Brindley stimulator in combination with sacral posterior root rhizotomy provides excellent results with limited morbidity.
