Herniation of the spinal cord 38 years after childhood trauma. We report an unusual post-traumatic spinal cord herniation, which became symptomatic 38 years after the trauma. A 44-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of increasing impotence, neuropathic bladder dysfunction and dissociated sensory loss below the level of T6. At the age of 6 years he had a severe blunt spinal injury with transient paraparesis. MRI revealed right lateral and ventral displacement of the spinal cord at the T5/6 level. The spinal cord was surgically exposed and found to herniate through a ventral defect of the arachnoid membrane and the dura mater. As there were no other events that could have precipitated spinal cord herniation the reported blunt trauma in childhood is the most likely cause for the spinal cord herniation in this patient.
