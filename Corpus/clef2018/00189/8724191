Short device fixation and early mobilization for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction. The authors present a retrospective study based on a homogeneous series of 34 patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction, fixed using Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. These patients underwent instrumentation using a short construct of hooks and screws gripping the two vertebrae above the lesion (2HS) and screws and hooks gripping the first vertebra below the lesion (1SH). This construct was therefore called "2HS-1SH". In order to evaluate just the material resistance after getting up, only the patients who were upright on the 4th day without a body cast and with no secondary anterior osteosynthesis were included in this study. Four patients showed some neurological symptoms on admission but recovery was so quick that they could be included in this study. Mean follow-up was 4 years 1 month (range 3 years 1 month and 6 years 2 months). Vertebral and regional kyphosis angles were measured preoperative, postoperatively and at the final follow-up. Functional recovery and complications were analyzed. Mean vertebral kyphosis was 21.2 degrees preoperatively, 3.8 degrees postoperatively and 5.3 degrees at the final follow-up. Regional kyphosis angles were respectively 19.2, 0.2, and 2.7 degrees. We had two cases of deep suppuration, one early and the other late. None of the patients required analgesics for more than 6 months after the operation. Patients returned to work after 5 months on average. The authors concluded that fixation by screw-and-hook constructs is an effective way to stabilize thoracolumbar junction burst fractures.
