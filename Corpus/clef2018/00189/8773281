Relationship between atlanto-odontoid osteoarthritis and idiopathic suboccipital neck pain. We discuss the relationship of atlanto-odontoid (AO) (anterior C1-C2 joint) osteoarthritis to suboccipital pain. A questionnaire regarding suboccipital neck pain was presented to 210 consecutive patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) of the brain or sinuses for a variety of indications. In all patients the AO joint and the lateral scout image of the cervical spine were studied. In 104 (49%) degenerative changes were seen at the AO joint. There were 89 patients (42%) who reported pain in the suboccipital region, although this was not the reason for CT in any patient. Statistical analysis of the prevalence of suboccipital neck pain in all patients showed the presence of AO osteoarthritis seen on CT to be associated with occurrence of these symptoms. This association remained significant in the same study population after excluding patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, stress and neck trauma and patients with signs of degenerative changes of C2-C7 on the computed lateral scout image.
