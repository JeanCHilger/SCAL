Severe ligamentous injury due to trauma of the mobile spinal segment of the cervical column (author's transl). The mobile spinal segment includes anatomically, all the soft parts which lie between two neighbouring vertebrae. Its involvement in trauma is not always obvious on initial X Ray. However, the course may lead to complete vertebral dislocation. The initial diagnosis is based on opening of the joint spaces, study of the mobility between two vertebrae by dynamic radiography. The distinction between a benign and a severe ligamentous sprain may thus be made. The attitude in cases of mobile spinal segment involvement, i.e. severe ligamentous injury, should include arthrodesis of the mobile segment affected and this is discussed here.
