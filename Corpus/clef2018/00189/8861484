Spondylodiscitis and mediastinitis after esophageal perforation owing to a swallowed radiolucent foreign body. A 6-year-old boy with aphagia presented with a radiolucent foreign body, esophageal perforation, mediastinitis, and a C6-C7 spondylodiscitis. A rigid plastic gear wheel was removed via thoracotomy, and the mediastinal abscess was drained through the esophagomediastinal fistula. Treatment included antibiotics as well as nonsurgical orthopedic management of the spondylodiscitis. The recovery period was uneventful, and the patient has remained asymptomatic for 2 years. Physicians must be aware of radiolucent foreign bodies. Computed tomography is very helpful in establishing the diagnosis of radiolucent foreign body, mediastinal abscess, and spondylodiscitis.
