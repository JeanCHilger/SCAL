Intervertebral disk calcification: an unusual cause of acquired torticollis in childhood. Intervertebral disk calcification in children can result in a syndrome of neck pain, muscle spasm, and torticollis. Usually the clinical course is benign with spontaneous recovery however, occasionally nerve root or spinal cord compression can be seen. We report a seven-year-old patient with symptomatic cervical disk calcification and briefly discuss the salient clinical and radiographic features.
