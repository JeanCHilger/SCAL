Spinal cord injury in children and adolescents: diagnostic pitfalls and therapeutic considerations in the acute stage [proceedings]. Traumatic spinal cord lesions in children are infrequent (2 to 5 per cent of all cases admitted to specialised paraplegic centres depending on whether the upper age limit is set at 10 or 15 years). Traffic accidents are responsible for at least 50 per cent of the lesions playground accidents and various sports add another 35 per cent. A large proportion of the accidents have been found to be related to the child's normal desire for adventure and exploration. The segment most frequently involved in our own series of 18 cases was the cervical and upper thoracic spine. Histopathological studies have shown that splitting of the cartilaginous end-plate in the growth zone of the vertebrae is a common finding. Radiological signs of spinal trauma are less evident than in adults
