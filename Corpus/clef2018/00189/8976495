Dorsal endodermal cyst of the upper cervical spine. This report describes a case of a rare, dorsally placed enterogenous cyst at the craniocervical junction. The patient had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging studies, followed by microsurgical removal of the cyst. The patient made an uneventful recovery from the surgery. Pathological examination revealed an enterogenous cyst. Although enterogenous cysts are more commonly found in the lower cervical or thoracic spine, it is important to recognize that they may also be found at the craniocervical junction. In addition, cysts may occur posterior to the chord. Microsurgical removal is usually effective in the treatment of these cysts.
