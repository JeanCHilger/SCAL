The relationship between cervical whiplash and temporomandibular joint injuries: an MRI study. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) symptoms are a common finding in motor vehicle accident (MVA) patients with hyperextension/hyperflexion injuries of the cervical spine (cervical whiplash). The relationship between cervical whiplash and TMJ injuries was documented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 87 consecutive MVA cervical whiplash patients who presented with TMJ symptoms and had sustained no direct trauma to the face, head or mandible and had no TMJ complaints prior to the MVA. One hundred sixty-four TMJ patients were evaluated for internal derangement, effusion and inflammation, utilizing T1 and T2 weighted images. A high percentage of the TMJ patients demonstrated abnormal findings: disk displacement with reduction (DDR), 118/164 (72%) disk displacement without reduction (DDNR), 25/164 (15%)
