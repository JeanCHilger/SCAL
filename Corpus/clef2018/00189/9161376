Gynecomastia following spinal cord disorder. Gynecomastia, an excessive development of the mammary glands in men, is a known phenomenon among patients with spinal cord disorder, yet in the last 50 years it has not been fully described in relation to spinal cord disorder. Over a period of 2 years, six patients with spinal cord disorder (4 secondary to a traumatic injury, 1 to decompression sickness, and 1 to transverse myelitis) manifested gynecomastia. The onset of gynecomastia occurred between 1 to 6 months after injury. These patients are presented along with a review of the possible causes for gynecomastia and a suggested workup routine. A clinical examination for the presence of gynecomastia should be performed for every patient with spinal cord disorder and a thorough endocrinological workup should follow to rule out malignancy and reassure the anxious patient undergoing a disruption of his body image.
