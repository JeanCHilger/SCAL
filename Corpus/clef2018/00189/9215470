MR of post traumatic spinal cord lesions. Unexpected improvement of hemorrhagic lesions. Fifteen patients who sustained spinal cord trauma were evaluated by MR within 72 hours of injury. Nine patients had hemorrhagic and six had nonhemorrhagic traumatic spinal cord lesions. Three patients with hemorrhagic and all six patients with nonhemorrhagic lesions showed some degree of neurological improvement on follow-up examinations. In two of the three patients with hemorrhagic lesions who improved, the hemorrhage was extensive. This supports the observation that hemorrhagic lesions are not always associated with a poor clinical outcome.
