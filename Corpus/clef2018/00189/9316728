Cervical spine fusion: not protective of cervical spine injury and tetraplegia. The occurrence of tetraplegic spinal cord injuries in two patients who had preexisting cervical spine fusions highlights the vulnerable nature of such patients. One patient sustained a C5-6 fracture-dislocation after a motor vehicle accident, despite a spontaneously fused cervical spine as a consequence of his juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. A second patient sustained a C3-4 distraction injury in a sporting injury 2 years after he had undergone a posterior cervical spine fusion because of an aneurysmal bone cyst. Prior to their spinal cord injuries, both patients had no apparent neurologic deficits, were relatively active, and followed no specific precautions for their spines.
