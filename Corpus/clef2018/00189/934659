Complicated mandibular fractures. In many mandibular fractures, proper alignment of the fragments is only a portion of the management program. Consideration must be given to the possibility of numerous other complications, and the patient should be carefully evaluated for injuries of the cervical spine, skull, head, and chest. The medical background, age, and other factors, such as the patient's ability to cooperate and follow the physician's instructions, may determine the method of applied treatment.
