CT morphology of fractured thoraco-lumbar vertebrae after transpedicular spongiosaplasty and use of internal fixator. An analysis of the CT morphology of fractured thoraco-lumbar vertebrae after treatment with internal fixation and transpedicular spongiosaplasty (SP).30 patients were examined following trauma and surgery after about 12 and 30 months by means of CT. The following were evaluated: width of the spinal canal height of the vertebra and intervertebral spaceThe width of the spinal canal was reconstituted in 91% in 83% the anterior vertebral margin and in 35% the intervertebral space was reduced. A kyphosis of 8.9 degree was found on the followup examination. The SP showed a reduction in size (18/30) or could no longer be defined (6/30). Hypodense areas (28/30) with cavitation (12/30) were found in the vertebral body and the SP could be identified by a sclerotic margin (22/30).Treatment by this form of therapy was successful, reaction of the vertebral body against the spongiosaplasty could be identified.
