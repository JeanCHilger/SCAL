Neurosomatic parallels in children with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Clinical, urodynamic and neurological examinations of 30 children with hyperreflex dysfunction of the bladder gave evidence for clinical symptoms of natal trauma sequelae in 23 of them. Diagnosis of polyvisceral functional changes and chronic urinary diseases was made significantly more frequently in children with neurological symptoms. High occurrence of neurological symptoms of natal subclinical cervical traumas in children with hyperreflex dysfunction of the bladder suggests their pathogenetic relations. Hemodynamic changes of the cerebral vessels with affection of the venous outflow may cause hypoxia of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal structures with emergence of symptom complex of vegetovascular dystonia and marked neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder. The authors conclude on validity of pathogenetic neurological therapy to coordinate the activity of spinal and supraspinal centers regulating function of the bladder.
