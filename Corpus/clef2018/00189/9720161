The results of omentomyelopexy in the late period of traumatic spinal cord disease. The results of omental transplantation to the site of spinal cord lesion in 40 patients in late injury are given. Neurological deficit was alleviated in 17.5% of patients. Improvement of segmentary functions was observed in most cases and was recorded within 1 week to 3 months postoperatively. There was no neurological improvement after 6 months postoperatively. Patients with mild spinal cord injuries (D10-L1) had the best outcomes. Comparative analysis of the outcomes of omentomyelopexy with those of treatment in 115 patients undergone meningomyeloradicolysis did not demonstrate any significant difference. Thus, it is not justifiable to use omental transposition in late spinal cord injury.
