The "posterior cervical line". A radiodiagnostic parameter of the cervical spine in children. The Posterior Cervical Line helps to differentiate pseudosubluxation from the true dislocation C 2/3 in children. But the line can also be used to recognize other pathologic conditions of the upper cervical spine in children, like atlanto-axial sagittal instability or rotatory dislocation.
