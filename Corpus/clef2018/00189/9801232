Cervical facet dislocation: management following delayed diagnosis. This study examined the influence of early versus late initial presentation of patients with cervical spine facet dislocation on presentation, neurologic deficit, and the success of closed reduction. Thirty-four patients were studied, and approximately 35% presented at least 72 hours following their injury. Compared with patients who presented early, this late group demonstrated less neurologic deficit, and closed reduction was less likely to be successful. These findings suggest that a distinction should exist in the management algorithm between early versus late presentation of cervical facet dislocation.
