Bilateral vocal cord paralysis following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Case report. The authors report a rare case of bilateral vocal cord paralysis following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACD/F) in a patient who had a preexisting, clinically silent, and unrecognized unilateral vocal cord paralysis from a remote cardiac surgical procedure. The patient, a 41-year-old woman who developed acute respiratory stridor and respiratory insufficiency at the time of extubation after undergoing a C6-7 ACD/F, required emergency reintubation and ventilation. Otolaryngological evaluation revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis with one vocal cord showing evidence of acute paralysis and the other showing evidence of chronic paralysis. She eventually required a permanent tracheotomy. The patient had undergone previous cardiac surgical procedures to correct Fallot's tetralogy as a neonate and as a child. At those times, there were no recognized symptoms of transient or permanent vocal cord dysfunction. This case emphasizes the importance of identifying patients with preexisting unilateral vocal cord paralysis before performing neurosurgical procedures such as ACD/F, which can place the only functioning vocal cord at risk for paralysis. Guidelines for identifying patients with preexisting unilateral vocal cord paralysis and for modifying the surgical procedure for ACD/F to prevent the catastrophic complication of bilateral vocal cord paralysis are discussed.
