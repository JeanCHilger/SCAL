Magnetic resonance imaging-compatible posterior cervical implant for occipitocervical stabilization. Technical note. Posterior cervical stabilization was accomplished in 30 patients (19 females and 11 males) by using sublaminar titanium cables and a new titanium bullet-shaped implant. Seventeen patients underwent occipitocervical fixation and 13 others were treated subaxially. These patients have been followed for 18 to 52 months (mean 36 months), and no implant has failed during the follow-up period.
