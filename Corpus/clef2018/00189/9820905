The pathogenesis of Schmorl's nodes in relation to acute trauma. An autopsy study. Seventy thoracolumbar spines from cadavers of individuals killed in motor vehicle accidents were examined pathologically and radiologically, particularly for the occurrence of acute Schmorl's nodes.To document whether Schmorl's nodes occur acutely as a result of trauma.Theories proposed to explain the pathogenesis of Schmorl's nodes include developmental, degenerative, traumatic, and disease influences. Few studies show a direct causal relation between a traumatic episode and acute Schmorl's node formation.Thoracolumbar spines were removed at autopsy, underwent radiography in the anteroposterior and lateral planes, fixed, sagittally cut, and underwent radiography a second time. Pathologic and radiographic examinations were performed.Nine acute Schmorl's nodes were detected, most in association with other acute injuries to the spine. Most acute Schmorl's nodes were present in spines from individuals aged 11-30 years, with a male to female ratio of 9:1, and were localized to the T8-L1 region. Spines from motorcyclists showed the highest percentage of acute Schmorl's nodes. No acute Schmorl's nodes were detected radiologically.Schmorl's nodes do occur acutely as the result of a single traumatic episode, and are almost always associated with other acute spinal injury. The frequency and occurrence of acute Schmorl's nodes in motorcyclists suggest that axial loading is an important mechanism. Their predominance in the T8-L1 region suggests that this region is particularly susceptible to stress.
