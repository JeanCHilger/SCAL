Fracture-dislocation of the dorsal spine. A patient with fracture-dislocation of D9 on D8 had considerable posterolateral displacement. The neurologic injolvement of his left leg proved to be progressive. Treatment consisted of posterior decompression, exploration, open reduction and stabilization by means of Harrington rods, and fusion. All neurologic findings resolved completely. Final evaluation 18 months later showed a good and serviceable spine with no residual neurologic deficits. In my opinion, the treatment used in this case under given circumstances represented a reasonable modality of therapy.
