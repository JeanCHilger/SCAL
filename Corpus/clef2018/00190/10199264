A new occipitocervical fusion construct in pediatric patients with occipitocervical instability. Technical note. Posterior occipitocervical stabilization procedures were successfully performed in 10 patients (nine boys and one girl) 16 years of age or younger by using C1-2 transarticular screws coupled with a rigid occipitocervical construct. The average length of follow-up evaluation was 18.8 months (range 5-37 months). No implant failed and all fusions were successful without the use of an external orthotic halo device.
