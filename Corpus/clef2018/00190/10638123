Role of computed tomography in spinal trauma. Twenty patients admitted for spinal trauma were studied with computed tomography (CT) scan. All the patients had initial routine plain radiographs in the anteroposterior and lateral views. Ten patients sustained injury due to fall from height, 7 suffered road side accident, 2 had injury due to fall of weight on back and one suffered due to slip on floor. Twelve patients had injury at multiple levels. Twenty-four vertebral bodies were involved in 20 patients, 10 had fracture of posterior elements only. Neurological deficit occurred in 16 patients. CT scan provided more information than plain radiography, which missed vertebral body fracture in 2 out of 24 instances and spinal canal compromise in 7 out of 12 patients. CT scan detected posterior element injuries better and in greater detail in all cases.
