Delayed presentation of abdominal bleeding in a teenage boy after a fall. The delayed presentation of an abdominal bleed in a victim of a fall is a rare occurrence. In the multiple injured patients, even with an intact sensorium, competing pain from associated injuries may mask the pain from a occult injury. Although a rare occurrence of abdominal injury in an asymptomatic neurologically intact patient, in the patient requiring a computed tomography scan of a spinal fracture, it may be worthwhile to image the abdomen and pelvis as well to rule out a concomitant occult abdominal injury. Current literature regarding injuries associated with falls from height are discussed that support this position and the delayed manifestation of an abdominal bleed in a 17-year-old boy 1 day after a fall is presented.
