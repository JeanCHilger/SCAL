Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of metastatic osteogenic sarcoma. Fourteen patients with 16 metastatic ostogenic sarcoma lesions were treated with high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) with citrovorum factor rescue (CFR), adriamycin, and pulse high-dose cyclophosphamide combined with radiation therapy. Thirteen of 16 lesions responded. Responses consisted of relief of pain (6/6 patients) in bone lesions, roentgenographic and clinical evidence of decrease in the size of the bone lesions (6/7 patients), and a decrease in the size of pulmonary metastases (2/4 patients). The 2 patients whose pulmonary metastases responded to combined therapy developed pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonitis in the treated areas 3 months after radiation therapy (RT) (1400 and 1600 rads respectively). Of two bulky primary tumors that appeared to respond, both were ultimately found to contain viable tumor a third less bulky primary tumor appeared to respond more completely. Three smaller metastatic bone lesions that were ultimately biopsied showed no evidence of active tumor. It is concluded that: 1) combination therapy (particularly HDMTX and RT) has an additive effect in controlling osteogenic sarcoma bone lesions, but bulky primary tumors cannot be completely eradicated
