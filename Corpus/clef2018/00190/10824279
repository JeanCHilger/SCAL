Cervicogenic headache: clinical aspects. Cervicogenic headache (CEH) is a relatively common but often overlooked disorder. There is sufficient evidence to support this category and the existing diagnostic criteria are adequate. Subgroups may exist and the clinical picture sometimes may be similar to that of other headache disorders, however. The pathophysiology of this condition and its relationship with other headache syndromes remain to be determined. Migrainous features may occur in some patients.
