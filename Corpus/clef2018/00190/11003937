Cervical spondylodiscitis in an infant. Spondylitis in childhood is rare, presenting a great variety of symptoms that are related to the child s age and to the site of the inflammatory process. We present the case of a nine-month-old infant, who presented to the emergency department with a torticollis of six weeks evolution. The diagnosis of spondylitis (C6-C7) was confirmed by MRI. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was administered. The patient showed complete regression of symptoms and imaging tests were normal. The rarity of this disease in patients in this age group, as well as the site and form of presentation are emphasised as is the importance of diagnosing this disease to prevent permanent neurological injuries or bone deformities.
