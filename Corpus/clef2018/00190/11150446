Characteristics of pediatric cervical spine injuries. The objective of this study was to assess the mechanisms and patterns of injury and outcome in children with cervical (C) spine trauma.We reviewed the National Pediatric Trauma Registry between April 1994 and March 1999 and identified (by ICD-9 criteria) all cases of blunt trauma victims with cervical fractures, dislocations, and spinal cord injuries without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). Data are shown as mean +/- SEM.During the 5-year period, the incidence of blunt C-spine injury was 1.6% (n = 408 of 24,740 total entries). Mean age was 10.5+/-0.3 (1 to 20) years, and 59% were boys. Leading mechanisms were motor vehicle accidents (n = 179 44%), sports (n = 66These data, representing the largest series to date, confirm that blunt C-spine injuries in children are rare. Patterns of injury vary significantly according to child age. Major neurologic sequelae in survivors is uncommon, does not correlate well with cord level, and rarely is complete.
