Management of craniocervical junction dislocation. The discovery of a craniocervical junction malformation requires management in three steps: (1) The patterns must be recognized using tomographic measurements (Chamberlain's line, Wackenheim's line). Dynamic flexion-extension studies are necessary to assess stability or instability. Stable patterns range from platybasia to basilar invagination, with gradual deformation, and are frequently associated with Chiari malformation. Unstable patterns characterized by odontoid instability are the equivalent of an odontoid fracture. The origin is malformative (hypoplasia, aplasia of the dens, os odontoidum), but the last may be difficult to distinguish from an old odontoid fracture. They are found in many syndromes (Down, Morquio, etc.). Unstable atlantoaxial patterns with atlas assimilation are hardly reducible they evolve toward progressive instability. (2) The neurological consequences must be defined from the clinical features of the spinal cord and the cranial nerves. Both static and dynamic MRI scans must be performed
