Spinal cord injury caused by gunshot wound during pregnancy. We report a case of a pregnant woman with acute spinal cord injury (C5) caused by gunshot wound and discuss the respective maternal and fetal considerations. Neither decompressive surgery nor corticosteroid protocols were used. At 37 weeks, the patient delivered a normal female infant after induction of labor and epidural anesthesia, with no medical or obstetrical complications. With conservative management and rehabilitation, this patient had significant recovery of function.
