Vertebral compression fractures in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and remodelling after treatment. Three children, aged 7-10 years, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia presented with back pain, along with a mild kyphosis. Collapse of the vertebral bodies at multiple levels was shown on imaging. Chemotherapy resulted in pain resolution and spontaneous remodelling of the vertebrae.
