Dorsal stabilization in dislocated fractures of C-1 and C-2 vertebrae with Palacos and wiring. During 1 year 6 patients with dislocated fractures of C-1 and C-2 vertebrae (fractures of the odontoid process) and 1 patient with a pseudarthrosis of the odontoid process have been treated. 6 patients have been treated surgically by internal fixation of the arch of C-1 and C-2 spinous process by wiring and plastic material (Palacos). No complications occurred. The advantage of the method was early mobilization of the patients and reduction of hospitalization. Clinical and radiographic follow-up studies showed stable fusion on Flexion-extension X-rays and boney union of the fracture of the odontoid process.
