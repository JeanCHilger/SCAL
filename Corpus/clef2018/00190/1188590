Post-traumatic syringomyelia. Post-traumatic syringomyelia is uncommon. It is seen predominantly after injury to the thoracic or the lumbar spine and rarely after injury to the cervical spine. In this report, three cases of post-traumatic syringomyelia are presented. The injury was limited to the thoracic spine in one case and to the cervical spine in the rest. The symptoms began after two years in two cases and after fifteen years in the third. The diagnosis was suggested by radiographic examination and was confirmed at operation in each case. Following evacuation and drainage of the cyst, significant improvement occurred in two patients.
