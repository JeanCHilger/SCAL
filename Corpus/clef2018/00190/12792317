Chronic tinnitus resulting from head or neck injuries. The main objectives were 1) to determine the percentage of cases of chronic tinnitus in a specialized clinic that resulted from head or neck injuries 2) to describe the characteristics of this populationRetrospective analysis of tinnitus clinic patient data.Detailed questionnaires were mailed to 2400 patients before their initial appointment at the Oregon Health and Science University Tinnitus Clinic (Portland, OR). All of the patients experienced and received treatment for chronic tinnitus. Patient data were entered into a database and later analyzed.Two hundred ninety-seven patients (214 male and 83 female patients) reported that their chronic tinnitus started as a result of head or neck injuries. Compared with patients whose tinnitus onset was not associated with trauma, patients with tinnitus associated with head or neck trauma were younger had better hearing thresholdsTinnitus is a significant symptom that commonly occurs as a result of head or neck trauma. The fact that tinnitus resulting from head or neck injuries tends to be more severe (and is often accompanied by a greater number of co-symptoms) than tinnitus resulting from other causes should be taken into account by clinicians treating these patients.
