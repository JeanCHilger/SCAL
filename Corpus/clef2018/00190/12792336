Single-level fixation of flexion distraction injuries. Flexion distraction injuries of the thoracic and lumbar spine can be stabilized with a short construct spanning one motion segment. This surgical technique has not been well accepted because of the paucity of published outcomes of patients treated in this manner. The current study is a cohort of patients who underwent a standardized posterior open reduction and single-level fixation for this injury pattern. Independent observation prospectively followed the cohort for a minimum of 20 months with functional and radiologic outcomes determined. A significant (p < 0.0001) correction of deformity was achieved, from a mean preoperative kyphosis of 10.1 degrees to a mean postoperative lordosis of 0.9 degrees. No loss of correction occurred. The mean Oswestry score was 11.5, with 88% of patients having minimal disability. This prospective study demonstrates the efficacy of posterior open reduction and single-level fixation of flexion distraction injuries.
