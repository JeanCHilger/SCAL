Lumbar Chance fracture associated with use of the lap belt restraint in an adolescent. The use of the 2-point seat belt or lap belt in motor vehicles, particularly to restrain young rear seat passengers, remains an issue of some concern. The occurrence of lumbar spinal flexion-distraction injuries in lap belt restrained children and adolescents during road traffic accidents is a well known phenomenon, but is still occurring. High velocity paediatric Chance fractures are frequently associated with significant intra-abdominal trauma. We present the case of a Chance fracture sustained by a 15 year old girl, involved in a motor vehicle collision, while wearing a lap belt. We emphasise the need to develop safer seat belt designs for juvenile car passengers.
