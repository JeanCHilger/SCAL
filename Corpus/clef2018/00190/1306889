Cervical meningocele and meningomyelocystocele. Apropos of 4 cases. Published cases of cervical dysraphic lesions are rare. Their estimated proportion is about 5% of the entire group of spinal dysraphism. Four cases are reported, representing 2 types of lesion: 2 meningoceles with a simple fibrous band fixing the posterior aspect of the cord to the skin and 2 meningomyelocystoceles with other associated anomalies (hydromyelia, hydrocephalus, Chiari II, Peter's ocular anomaly). The clinical presentation is that of a soft posterior cervical mass without marked neurological impairement. The surgical treatment is simple, consisting in the resection of the lesion, intradural exploration to untighten the cord if fixed by a fibrous band, and drainage of the hydrocephalus. Neurological outcome is generally good immediately but may need sometimes secondary surgical exploration.
