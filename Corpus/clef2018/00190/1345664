Nuclear magnetic tomography in the diagnosis of spinal cord cysts. Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) was used in examinations of 172 patients with spinal cord abnormalities. Thirty-eight cysts were detected: 25 in syringomyelia, 5 in intramedullary tumors, 4 posttraumatic and 4 postoperational ones. Based on the MRT patterns, two types of syringomyelia were distinguished, the occlusive and idiopathic ones. The size and site of cyst, as shown by the MRT, did not conform to its neurologic symptoms. A characteristic feature of tumorous cysts was a highly intensive signal originating from their contents. Traumatic cysts were detected against the background of diffuse atrophy of the cord. Computer-aided tomography did not give full-value information in such cases and therefore could not be recommended in cases with suspected intramedullary cysts.
