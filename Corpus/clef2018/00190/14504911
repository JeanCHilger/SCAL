Cervical involvement in juvenile-onset ankylosing spondylitis with bone scintigraphy. Juvenile-onset ankylosing spondylitis is an unusual disorder which can present with either peripheral arthritis or more classic hip girdle and back symptoms. A 12-year-old child with this disease was admitted with walking disorder, cervical pain, restricted cervical motion, and right ankle swelling. Diffusely increased accumulation of radioactivity in the cervical spine, focally increased accumulation in bilateral sacroiliac joints, and diminished irregular uptake in thoracal spine were detected on technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy. As a result, this imaging technique may give important information for diagnosis and differential diagnosis in juvenile chronic arthritis.
