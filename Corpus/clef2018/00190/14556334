Spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality (SCIWORA). SCIWORA or Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiological Abnormality is a pre-MRI term that includes injuries to the spinal cord in the absence of radiological (plain radiographs, tomographs and CT scans) evidence of injury to the spinal column or cord. It occurs in skeletally immature spines because of the inherent plasticity of the bony structures in this age group. The prognosis is dependent on the extent of cord damage, and the role of active management is limited. A high index of suspicion is needed to establish a diagnosis. This diagnostic accuracy can be improved with the free availability of MRI scanning for the spines. We describe three cases of SCIWORA with a minimum follow-up of three years and a review of current literature.
