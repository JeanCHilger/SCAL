Long-term outcomes of surgical treatment for tethered cord syndrome. Surgical outcomes for tethered spinal cord syndrome (TCS) associated with low-lying conus medullaris were evaluated. We investigated the long-term results of untethering the spinal cord and dural plasty in surgical patients with a wide age range. Improvement of bladder dysfunction and suppression of leg deformity progression were noted in two pediatric patients. However, severe urinary dysfunction generally remained postoperatively. Adult patients commonly showed low back or leg pain as clinical manifestations. In seven adult patients, urinary dysfunction also improved. Neurologic findings and urinary deficits showed a favorable improvement mostly in adult TCS in comparison with natal or juvenile onset of TCS. A short duration from onset to surgery and cranial movement of the conus medullaris as assessed by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging were factors indicating a favorable prognosis.
