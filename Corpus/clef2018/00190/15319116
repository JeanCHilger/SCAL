Benefits of Australian Design Rule 69 (full frontal crash protection) and airbags in frontal crashes in Australia. In-depth data at MUARC was used to evaluate the Australian Design Rule 69 (ADR69) - Full frontal dynamic crash requirement, as well as the effectiveness of frontal airbag deployment on injury risk and associated cost of injury. ADR69 was introduced in Australia in mid-1995 and was based largely on the US equivalent FMVSS-208. The results indicate reductions in excess of 90% in the likelihood of sustaining AIS 2+ injuries in body regions where frontal airbags would be expected to benefit. The average injury cost savings for drivers of post-ADR69 manufactured vehicles was found to be up to AUD19,000 dollars depending on body region considered. Limitations and implications of these findings are discussed.
