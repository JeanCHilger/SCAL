Quantification of acute muscle pain after whiplash injury using computer-aided pressure algesimetry. The present study utilised the PC-interactive pressure algesimetry to quantify cervical pain after whiplash injury. Pressure painfulness of the splenius and trapezius muscles was investigated in patients with an acute cervical syndrome after whiplash injury and compared to that of healthy subjects.Pressure painfulness of neck and shoulder muscles was significantly increased in whiplash patients. The trapezius muscles were more painful left than right, probably due to the seat belt position.The computer-interactive pressure algesimetry enables a standardised, rater-independent quantification of cervical pain due to whiplash injury.
