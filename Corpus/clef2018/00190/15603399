The influence of the cervical proprioception on the postural reflexes--experimental and clinical study. The aim of the study was to estimate the effect of the neck proprioception on the postural reflexes in the cases of the cervical pathology in the whiplash injury and degenerative disease of the cervical vertebral column. The investigation using ENG and stabilometry was performed in 81 patients. Experimental observations were done among 10 pigeons with limitation of the neck proprioceptors action by special neck tutor. Their postural reflexes were analysed during balance test on the seesaw. Our conclusion is, that disorders of the proprioceptors impulastion can damage the postural reflexes even in patients with normal labyrinth function.
