The effectiveness of a hydrogel dressing compared with standard management of pressure ulcers. To compare a hydrogel dressing with a conservative topical wound-care regimen (gauze with povidone-iodine) for the treatment of pressure ulcers.A prospective study comprising 27 (24 male and three female) spinal-cord injury patients with a total of 49 pressure ulcers. Wounds were randomised into a treatment group (n=25) or control group (n=24). The primary outcome measure was the rate of wound healing (cm2/days).Healing rates in the treatment group were higher than in the control group, although this was not statistically significant. Some 84% of the wounds in the treatment group and 54% in the control group epithelialised, which was statistically significant (p=0.04). The mean healing time in the treatment group was 48 days compared with 45 days for the controls.Our results suggest that hydrogel occlusive wound dressings facilitate healing by promoting more rapid epithelialisation of pressure ulcers, when compared with conservative wound care.
