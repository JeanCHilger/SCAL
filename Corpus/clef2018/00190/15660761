Adhesive fragment reattachment after orthodontic extrusion: a case report. In the treatment of crown fractures, adhesive fragment reattachment provides a good alternative to other restorative techniques, offering several advantages. The present paper reports a case in which the treatment of a cervical crown fracture was accomplished by reattaching the tooth fragment with a flowable resin composite. Orthodontic root extrusion was performed with a modified Hawley appliance prior to fragment reattachment. The clinical and radiographic results after 2.5 years were successful.
