Implementation of the Canadian C-spine rule reduces cervical spine x-ray rate for alert patients with potential neck injury. The objectives of this before-and-after study of alert, stable adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department of Western Hospital with potential neck injuries who were immobilized in hard cervical collars were to determine the impact of implementation of the Canadian C-spine rule on x-ray ordering rates and whether implementation of the rule reduced time in hard collars for patients with potential neck injury. Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, x-ray rate, and time in hard collar. Data analysis was by chi-square test for proportions and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. There were 211 patients studied. The x-ray ordering rate decreased from 67% to 50% (25% relative reduction, p = 0.0187). Time in hard collar was also reduced from a median of 128 min to a median of 103 min (effect size 25.5 min), but this did not reach statistical significance. Implementation of the Canadian C-spine rule reduced x-ray ordering by 25%.
