Traumatic perinatal cervical dislocation. We report on a case of cervical dislocation in which the severity of the lesion contrasts with the paucity of the symptoms. An eight-month-old girl presented with weakness of the left upper limb. She had a normal cephalic delivery. On the following days, increased weakness of the limb showed a spontaneous, partial regression. Clinical examination at eight months showed a normal physical and psychical development, a falling neck and an impossibility to maintain the sitting position, but a normal mobility of the lower limbs. Cervical radiography performed showed a complete dislocation. CT confirmed the diagnosis and eliminated congenital vertebral anomalies. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an important stretching and compression of the spinal cord. Cervical spine damage in the newborn are scarce and serious. The here reported case is characterized by a complete vertebral dislocation associated with medullar stretching and compression, but few initial symptoms.
