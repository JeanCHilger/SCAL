The effect of intravesical Marcain instillation on hyperreflexic detrusor contractions. Thirty-six patients with suprasacral spinal injury were treated with intravesical local anaesthetic instillation. Eighteen of 32 patients (56%) were converted from an 'ice water positive' hyperreflexic state to an 'ice water negative' state by bupivacaine hydrochloride. Four patients treated with lignocaine hydrochloride showed no benefit. Intravesical local anaesthetic instillation is suggested as a possible treatment for selected cases of detrusor hyperreflexia in patients on intermittent catheterisation.
