Acute myeloid leukemia presenting as spinal cord compression. We report the findings of a 10-year-old boy who presented to a pediatric emergency department with symptoms of spinal cord compression. Radiological imaging demonstrated multiple soft tissue masses in the head and spine. The surgical pathology showed that the masses were comprised of myeloid leukemia cells. These findings were consistent with those observed on bone marrow aspiration. The characteristics and management of extramedullary leukemia are discussed.
