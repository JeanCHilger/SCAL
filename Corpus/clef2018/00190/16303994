Evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma using PACS-based 2D and 3D MDCT reformations of the lumbar spine and pelvis. The purpose of this study was to show the value of 2D and 3D reformations of CT data from abdominal and pelvic CT performed immediately at the workstation using a PACS-based software program to evaluate the lumbar spine and pelvis in patients with blunt abdominal trauma.We reviewed the abdominopelvic CT scans and conventional radiographs of the lumbar spine or pelvis of 156 consecutive patients with blunt abdominal trauma. The CT data were compared with the radiographic findings and also with the findings of dedicated repeat CT of the spine or pelvis, when performed.CT depicted 80 fractures of the lumbar spine and 178 pelvic fractures. Radiography showed 40 fractures of the lumbar spine and 138 pelvic fractures. No additional fractures were identified on dedicated repeat CT.Conventional radiographs to clear the lumbar spine are no longer required when abdominopelvic CT data are available. CT and reformatted CT data show more fractures than radiography and miss no fractures compared with dedicated CT of the lumbar spine or pelvis. Having these images immediately available through the PACS workstation saves time for the trauma team in the management of critically ill patients.
