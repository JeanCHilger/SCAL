Progressive syringomyelia controlled by treatment of associated hydrocephalus in an infant with birth injury. Case report. The author's aim in reporting this case is to extend awareness of the importance of management of associated hydrocephalus among patients with syringomyelia to the posttraumatic state. A full-term infant was delivered by cesarean section because of transverse lie. In the 2nd week of life, hypotonia affecting the lower limbs and the left upper limb was recognized. On MR imaging, posterior fossa subdural hemorrhage and spinal cord injury at the T-1 and T-2 levels were evident. Sequential imaging studies demonstrated progressive myelomalacic changes in the cervical spinal cord and eventual development of syrinx cavities as far cephalad as C-3. Hydrocephalus developed simultaneously as well. A ventriculoperitoneal cerebrospinal fluid shunt was inserted at 22 months of age. Six months after shunt insertion, MR imaging demonstrated regression of the posttraumatic syringomyelia. The patient was stable from an imaging standpoint at 16 months after shunt insertion, and she has continued to make developmental progress. The importance of treatment of associated hydrocephalus is widely recognized in the management of syringomyelia associated with the Chiari malformations. It should be considered in the management of posttraumatic syringomyelia as well.
