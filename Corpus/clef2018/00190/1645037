Powerlessness in acute spinal cord injury patients: a descriptive study. The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and characteristics of the nursing diagnosis, powerlessness, in an acute spinal cord injury (SCI) population. This descriptive study had a sample of 50 SCI patients admitted during the acute phase of injury to a model systems SCI center. Patients with a length of stay of greater than or equal to 15 days experienced a significantly higher (p less than .01) occurrence of powerlessness than did those with hospitalization of less than 15 days. Powerlessness was not found to cluster or occur in any pattern but was random throughout hospitalization. There was a statistically significant relationship (p less than .01) between the occurrence of powerlessness and patient acuity, with the occurrence increasing as acuity increased in severity. Quadriplegics and patients over the age of 60 years had a higher occurrence of powerlessness (p less than .05). This study demonstrated powerlessness was a commonly occurring diagnosis in acute SCI.
