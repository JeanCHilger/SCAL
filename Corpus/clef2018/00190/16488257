Aneurysmal bone cyst of the cervical spine in a child: case report and review of the surgical role. Surgical treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts of the cervical spine, frequently affecting pediatric patients, is a challenge to operating surgeons. Complete tumor resection offers the best chance for cure.We present the case of a child with an expansile aneurysmal bone cyst of the cervical spine that involves all 3 spinal columns. The advantages of combining a posterolateral followed by anterior approach after a preoperative angiography and vertebral artery balloon occlusion testing provided the added safety to maximize the extent of tumor resection. Spinal stabilization was successfully achieved in both approaches.The challenge of surgically resecting aneurysmal bone cysts of the cervical spine in children enabled us to achieve a total resection with the help of preoperative angiography and vertebral artery balloon occlusion testing. Spinal instability should be addressed with reconstruction and stabilization techniques.
