Classification of thoracolumbar spine fractures based on a complete imaging investigation in 33 patients. The thoracolumbar spine fractures constitute a wide spectrum of resultant lesions, with distinct injury mechanisms. In order to reduce the controversies concerning about the management of these fractures, a universally accepted classification is necessary. In this study we evaluated retrospectively 33 patients with thoracolumbar spine fracture, with the goal of categorize and evaluate the factors related to this pathology. A complete radiological investigation, complaining of plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, was used to classify these fractures. Fall was the more common mechanism, present in 24 cases. In 57.6% of the patients, the fractures located at thoracolumbar transition (T12-L1) and the more frequent neurological presentation was total deficit, present in 45.45%. The neurological presentation was more serious in patients with thoracic lesions regarding lumbar lesions (Fischer's test, p=0.039). A positive correlation was observed between severity of the neurological presentation and gravity of the lesion according to Magerl's classification (Pearson's method, r=0.85, p<0.001). In conclusion, thoracolumbar spine fractures are serious lesions considering the initial neurological presentation a wide and accurate classification, as we used, is necessary to describe these injuries and may help resolve some of the controversies concerning the management of these lesions.
