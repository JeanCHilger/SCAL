Superior odontoid migration in the Klippel-Feil patient. Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) is an uncommon condition noted primarily as congenital fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae. Superior odontoid migration (SOM) has been noted in various skeletal deformities and entails an upward/vertical migration of the odontoid process into the foramen magnum with depression of the cranium. Excessive SOM could potentially threaten neurologic integrity. Risk factors associated with the amount of SOM in the KFS patient are based on conjecture and have not been addressed in the literature. Therefore, this study evaluated the presence and extent of SOM and the various risk factors and clinical manifestations associated therein in patients with KFS. Twenty-seven KFS patients with no prior history of surgical intervention of the cervical spine were included for a prospective radiographic and retrospective clinical review. Radiographically, McGregor's line was utilized to evaluate the degree of SOM. Anterior and posterior atlantodens intervals (AADI/PADI), number of fused segments (C1-T1), presence of occipitalization, classification-type, and lateral and coronal cervical alignments were also evaluated. Clinically, patient demographics and presence of cervical symptoms were assessed. Radiographic and clinical evaluations were conducted by two independent blinded observers. There were 8 males and 19 females with a mean age of 13.5 years at the time of radiographic and clinical assessment. An overall mean SOM of 5.0 mm (range = -1.0 to 19.0 mm) was noted. C2-C3 (74.1%) was the most commonly fused segment. A statistically significant difference was not found between the amount of SOM to age, sex-type, classification-type, AADI, PADI, and lateral cervical alignment (P > 0.05). A statistically significant greater amount of SOM was found as the number of fused segments increased (r = 0.589 P = 0.001) and if such levels included occipitalization (r = 0.616
