Xeroradiography of the neck and of the salivary glands (author's transl). This paper describes the possibilities of xeroradiography in the neck area. 6 clinical samples demonstrate the usefulness of this method in the diagnosis of different disorders of the neck organs. The advantage of xeroradiography is that in contrast to conventional x-ray technique all tissue densities are represented in a single image. The problems of the different radiation exposure are discussed.
