Amenorrhoea in newly spinal cord injured women: an effect of hyperprolactinaemia? Prospective, single centre study.Previous studies have suggested a relationship between stress reaction and elevated levels of prolactine. The aim of the present study was to investigate if there was a relationship between s-prolactine and menstrual cycle status following spinal cord injury (SCI).Spinal Cord Injury Unit, Göteborg, Sweden.S-prolactine and menstrual cycle status were investigated in 16 consecutive women with SCI, treated at the SCI Unit, Sahlgrens University Hospital, Göteborg, Sweden. Level of injury ranged from C1 to L5, ASIA A-D. Mean age at injury was 45 years (range 20-79).S-Prolactine showed a mean value of 741 mIU/l (standard deviation (s.d.): 625 95% confidence interval (CI): 435-1788 mIU/l, reference value <400 mIU/l). When dividing the group according to fertility status we found hyperprolactinaemia in the women who were in childbearing age (n=9): mean value 1050 mIU/l (s.d.: 678Amenorrhoea following SCI is correlated to level of s-prolactine. We found no correlation between level of s-prolactine and level or degree of injury.
