An analysis of the results of transferring the musculocutaneous nerve onto the median nerve in tetraplegics. Following injuries of the cervical spinal cord at the common level with C6 neurological level sparing, abduction of the shoulder and elbow flexion remain active. The flexors of the elbow are controlled by the musculocutaneous nerve formed mainly from C5 and C6 fibers, the motor cells of which are usually located above the level of the spinal lesion. The encouraging report of anastomosis of the musculocutaneous nerve to the median nerve, described by Benassy and Robart, induced us to perform similar operations in 42 patients with traumatic tetraplegia. In 32 patients this has restored simple grasping function of the hand, increasing the patients' independence. The operation is particularly indicated in cases of complete lesion of the spinal cord at the C6-C7 level in young people, and for best results should be performed with in the first few months after trauma.
