Flexion-distraction injuries to the lumbar spine associated with abdominal injuries. Flexion-distraction injuries to the lumbar spine frequently occur with concomitant abdominal viscus injury. We encountered 16 patients with flexion-distraction lumbar spine injuries. Half of them also suffered abdominal viscus rupture. Lap safety belts were most frequently associated with these injuries however, the incorrect, underarm use of the shoulder harness was common in our series. The diagnosis of the spinal injury was frequently delayed when abdominal viscus injury occurred together with a flexion-distraction spinal injury. Thorough physical and radiographic examination of the spine as well as a detailed history, including seat belt use, is necessary to diagnose these injuries properly.
