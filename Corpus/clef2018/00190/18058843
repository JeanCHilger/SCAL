Prenatal diagnosis of dumbbell neuroblastoma. A neuroblastoma that develops in the sympathetic nodes can infiltrate the intervertebral foramina and invade the spinal canal, leading to spinal cord and nerve root compression and neurological impairment. Dumbbell neuroblastomas are now considered to be unresectable tumors and preoperative chemotherapy is recommended. We report the prenatal diagnosis of a dumbbell neuroblastoma successfully managed through premature delivery followed by immediate chemotherapy. We suggest that delivering prematurely in such cases is only of benefit if chemotherapy can be administered under favorable conditions. Chemotherapy should proceed immediately after delivery in order to reduce the size of the tumoral mass and its effects on the spine.
