Fractures of the odontoid in children with an open basilar synchondrosis. Fractures of the odontoid in children with an open basilar synchondrosis differ from those which occur in older children and adults. We have reviewed the morphology of these fractures and present a classification system for them. There were four distinct patterns of fracture (types IA to IC and type II) which were distinguished by the site of the fracture, the degree of displacement and the presence or absence of atlantoaxial dislocation. Children with a closed synchondrosis were classified using the system devised by Anderson and D'Alonzo. Those with an open synchondrosis had a comparatively lower incidence of traumatic brain injury, a higher rate of missed diagnosis and a shorter mean stay in hospital. Certain subtypes (type IA and type II) are likely to be missed on plain radiographs and therefore more advanced imaging is recommended. We suggest staged treatment with initial stabilisation in a Halo body jacket and early fusion for those with unstable injuries, severe displacement or neurological involvement.
