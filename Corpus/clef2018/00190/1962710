Spine injuries in gymnasts and swimmers. An epidemiologic investigation. Three groups of top level female gymnasts of preelite, elite, national and Olympic caliber were studied without regard to back pain or injury. These athletes were compared to a similar group of national caliber female swimmers. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of each participant were used to document disk or bony abnormalities. The relationship between magnetic resonance imaging findings and age, height, weight, previous injuries, back symptoms, and hours of training per week each year was examined. Nine percent of preelite (1/11), 43% of elite (6/14), and 63% of Olympic level (5/8) gymnasts had spine abnormalities 15.8% of all swimmers had spine abnormalities. Average hours of training per week and age were found to be associated with abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging. Increased intensity and length of training correlated with previous data that suggests the female gymnast is prone to spine injuries.
