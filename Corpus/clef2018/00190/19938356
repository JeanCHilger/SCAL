Corrective growth after vertebral body fracture in the adolescence. We present the case of a 13-year-old female patient who sustained an incomplete burst fracture of the 1st lumbar vertebral body and an impression fracture of the 3rd vertebral body. Using a dorsal instrumentation the kyphosis of the thoracolumbar junction was treated. The radiographical follow-up indicated a correction of the involved vertebral bodies. However, complete restoration of the height of the vertebral bodies was not achieved. In view of this long-term follow-up the potential for correction of the adolescent thoracolumbar junction spine is discussed.
