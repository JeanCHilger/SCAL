Transoral closure of a perforation of the hypopharynx from blunt trauma. Hypopharyngeal perforation secondary to blunt trauma is a rare injury. It can be managed operatively or expectantly without clear criteria for either approach. Here, we present a case of a 17-year-old adolescent boy who had a hypopharyngeal tear from direct blunt trauma to the anterior neck received during a high school football game. Physical examination demonstrated cervical crepitus, and neck radiograph revealed air in the retropharyngeal space. Rigid endoscopy diagnosed a 3-cm linear tear in the posterior hypopharynx. The tear was repaired transorally using laparoscopic instruments and visualized by a rigid endoscope, followed by anterior neck dissection and drain placement. Postoperatively, he was kept nil per os and received intravenous antibiotics. He was discharged home and returned to the football field the same fall.
