Ischiatic pressure sores: our experience in coupling a split-muscle flap and a fasciocutaneous flap in a 'criss-cross' way. Description of a technique and prospective follow-up study.The aim of this study was to present our experience in the surgical treatment of ischial pressure sores, especially recurrence.The Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Spinal Injuries Unit, CTO Hospital, Rome, Italy.From 1995 to 1997, the authors used in 12 consecutive paraplegic patients, who had a grade III or IV decubitus ulcer in the ischial area only, two different and independent flaps coupled together in a 'criss-cross' musculocutaneous flap: a split-muscle gluteus maximus flap and a rhomboid fasciocutaneous local flap. The average follow-up period was 3 years and 9 months. Details of the operative procedure are presented to prove that this criss-cross closure of the ischial pressure sore beneficial for patients with spinal cord injury.All flaps survived recurrence of the decubitus ulcer occurred in one patient (8%). Pressure-sore-free survival after surgery was 20 months in the patient with recurrence and an average of 26 months in patients without recurrence.The results obtained confirm this procedure to be safe and useful. We believe this technique to be a valuable alternative for the reconstruction of primary or recurrent ischial pressure ulcers.
