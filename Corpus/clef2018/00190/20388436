The surgical treatment of severe adolescent idiopathic cervical kyphosis. To summarize the clinical characteristics of severe adolescent idiopathic cervical kyphosis and the operation method.A retrospective study was performed in 12 adolescent patients with severe cervical kyphosis treated from July 2003 to January 2007. Preoperative the Cobb angle of kyphosis range from 55 degrees to 73 degrees (average 61 degrees ). According to the angles between the posterior vertebral body tangents at every involved level on lateral cervical radiograph in extension, the osteotomy angles and range of lamina and facet were decided. The anterior release and posterior osteotomy were performed firstly. Then skull traction was maintained in order to correct the deformity as long as possible, fusion and internal fixation was completed after 7-10 days. The cervical coronal and sagittal planes X-rays and the MR were hold after operation 3 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. At the same time the treatment result, bone fusion and the instrumentation were followed up, and the symptoms were compared between pre-operation and post-operation.The defect appearance of the patients was improved significantly, with the total disappearance of neck pain and improvement of nerve function. Post-operational cervical spine MR showed that the physiological curve of cervical spine was restored, cerebral spinal fluid line was clear in the kyphosis area and no spinal cord compression was found. X-ray imaging of post-operation 3 d showed that Cobb angle ranged from -12.3 degrees to 11.2 degrees with an average of -2.0 degrees . Beside one patient's AISA score was D, other patient's AISA score was E.The severe adolescent idiopathic cervical kyphosis has its own clinical manifestation. It is an ideal treatment to completely assess the deformity, have staging operation and skull traction between two operations.
