Spinal cord compression by epidural involvement over 21 vertebral levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Spinal cord compression is a rare complication of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We report a 13-year-old boy with B-precursor ALL, presenting with restriction of breathing and back pain. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed extremely high protein levels. Radiologic examination indicated that leukemia extended from the thoracic to sacral epidural spaces over 21 vertebral lengths in a band-shaped form, threatening to induce compressive spinal cord neuropathy. Prompt initiation of systemic chemotherapy relieved the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow without local irradiation or surgical intervention. To our knowledge, this patient has shown the most extensive epidural involvement among ALL patients previously reported.
