The challenges of managing spine and spinal cord injuries: an evolving consensus and opportunities for change. The current Spine Focus Issue reflects the collective efforts of members of the Spine Trauma Study Group, and seeks to summarize as well as critically evaluate many of the key controversies related to the management of spinal trauma and spinal cord injury. Some of the topics discussed in this issue include the optimal timing for surgical intervention in spinal cord injury and central cord syndrome, the optimal treatment for both elderly and skeletally mature individuals with odontoid process fractures, management of pediatric spine trauma, rehabilitation strategies for the spinal injured patient, return to play guidelines, and variations in international practice patterns for the management of common spine trauma scenarios. The current Spine issue serves as an update to clinicians on these topics as well as a framework for stimulating new discussion and research in the field as a whole.
