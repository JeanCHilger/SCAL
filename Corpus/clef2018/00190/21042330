The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury: relationship between S4-5 dermatome testing and anorectal testing. Prospective cross-sectional multicenter study.To evaluate the correlation, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of S4-5 dermatome and the anorectal examination for determination of sacral sparing in the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) examination.Two tertiary hospitals that specialize in pediatric spinal cord injuries.In all, 189 patients who were at minimum 3 month after spinal cord injury participated in complete ISNCSCI examinations. All examiners completed training for the proper completion of the ISNCSCI examination. Correlations and sensitivity/specificity analyses were conducted between S4-5 dermatome testing and the anorectal examination. Results were analyzed by age of patient, examiner, tetraplegia/paraplegia classification and injury level (T10-S3, L1-S3 and S3).The correlation between S4-5 dermatome and anorectal sensation was moderate (0.62, P<0.001). Using the anorectal examination as the gold standard, the sensitivity of S4-5 testing was 0.60 (0.49, 70) and specificity was 0.96 (0.90, 0.99). No single age group, tester, level, or type of injury differed from the overall result.In the pediatric population, the correlation between S4-5 and anorectal sensation was lower than anticipated. The sensitivity of 0.62 for S4-5 testing and diminished sensation between T10 and S3 suggests that anorectal testing may either be a more sensitive representation of S4-5 function or activate an alternative neuronal pathway that is perceived by the patient. Further investigation into the validity of the sacral sparing components of the ISNCSCI examination is warranted.
