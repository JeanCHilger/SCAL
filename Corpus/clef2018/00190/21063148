Results of 'two above- one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The aim of this retrospective clinical study was to evaluate and compare the results of the technique so called 'two above one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site with long-segment posterior fusion in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. For this purpose neurologically intact 27 patients having isolated one level thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion in our clinic via 'two above-one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site. A control group consisting of 15 patients having one level thoracolumbar burst fracture treated with long segment posterior spinal fusion in our institute was formed. At the preoperative, postoperative and final follow up period, anterior body height loss, local kyphosis and sagittal index values of both groups were noted. At the final follow up Visual Analogue Pain Scale and Oswestry disability scores were noted. Retrospective data from both groups underwent statistical analysis. In both groups anterior body height loss, local kyphosis and sagittal index measurements improved at the final follow-up, but there was no significance between two groups in terms of radiological and clinical follow-up data. The loss of correction in local kyphosis of short-segment group in the interval between postoperative and follow-up period was also significant. No implant failure was noted. As a conclusion 'two above one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site is associated with loss of correction radiographically, but favorable clinical outcomes in the presence of any implant failure can be achieved in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
