Pseudarthrosis of cervical rib: an unusual cause of thoracic outlet syndrome. Thoracic outlet syndrome is uncommon in adolescence. Cervical rib fracture is an extremely rare cause of thoracic outlet syndrome in this age group. We report an unusual case of thoracic outlet syndrome in a 14-year-old girl caused by pseudarthrosis of the cervical rib. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed significant compression of the brachial plexus by the pseudarthrosis mass. Excision of the cervical rib through a supraclavicular approach gave excellent results in this case.
