Cervical endplate and facet arthrosis: an anatomic study of cadaveric specimens. An anatomic, epidemiologic study of cervical endplate and facet arthrosis in cadaveric spines.To determine the prevalence of cervical endplate and facet arthrosis and the relationship between these 2 entities in a large population sample.Cervical endplate and facet arthrosis are common radiographic findings, which have both been linked to pain. However, the prevalence and relationship between cervical endplate and facet arthrosis has not been clearly defined.The cervical vertebrae from 234 cadaveric spines were examined by a single investigator for evidence of endplate and facet arthrosis. Arthrosis at each endplate and facet was graded on a continuum from 0 to IV. Race, age at death, and sex of each specimen were also recorded. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to analyze any association between race, age, sex, endplate arthrosis, and facet arthrosis. Factors with P values <0.05 remained in the analysis. Two-tailed t tests for matched samples were used to analyze any difference between mean endplate and facet arthrosis severity scores among patients within the same decades of life.Concurrent cervical endplate and facet arthrosis was present in 77% of the study population. Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed significant (P<0.01) associations between endplate and facet arthrosis and between age and facet arthrosis. Race and sex did not correlate with facet arthrosis. In addition, patients in age groups 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 to 89 demonstrated more severe (P<0.01) endplate arthrosis in comparison with facet arthrosis.Concurrent cervical endplate and facet arthrosis is a common condition. Cervical endplate arthrosis and advancing age are associated with cervical facet arthrosis independent of race and sex. Cervical endplate arthrosis precedes facet arthrosis.
