Giant cell tumor of the odontoid in an adolescent male: radiation, chemotherapy, and resection for recurrence with 10-year follow-up. Giant cell tumors (GCTs) are rare lesions of the cervical spine, with only 14 previously reported pediatric cases in the literature, all occurring in females. The authors present the case of a 15-year-old boy with neck pain who was found to have a lytic GCT of the odontoid process. Following resection, recurrent disease was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy and then a final resection. He has remained tumor free for more than 10 years. The rarity of GCTs can make their diagnosis difficult in the cervical spine. Because of their aggressive behavior and relative resistance to adjuvant therapy, GCTs must be monitored diligently and treated aggressively.
