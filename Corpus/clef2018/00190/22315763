Evaluation of pedicular screw fixation in dorsolumbar spinal injury. Twenty-five patients with dorsolumbar spinal injury was treated by pedicular screw fixation along with direct or indirect decompression within 1 1/2 years period. Eighteen patients with incomplete neurodeficit had some amount of neurological recovery in terms of ASIA impairment scale but no neurological recovery was seen in 6 patients with complete neurological injury. Mean correction of kyphotic angle was 11.76 degrees. Mean postoperative increase in anterior vertebral body height was 43%. Complications like bed sore, superficial wound infections and peroperative dural tear were seen but all of which were treated successfully. Neurological deterioration after operation, screw pull out and implant failure were seen in none. This study indicates that short segment pedicular screw fixation is a safe and effective method for treatment of unstable spinal injury.
