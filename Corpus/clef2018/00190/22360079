Assessing skeletal relationships using the cervical vertebral curvature. The aim of this study was to determine any association amongst the cervical vertebral morphology and the various sagittal and vertical facial patterns. The results of this study demonstrate a relationship between the cervical vertebral morphology and the skeletal facial patterns. This may be of some assistance to an orthodontist to diagnose a skeletal malocclusion at a glance just by looking at the patient's cervical vertebral curvature.
