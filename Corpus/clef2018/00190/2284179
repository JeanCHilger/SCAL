Comparative analysis of the informative value of roentgenological diagnosis and computerized tomography of birth injuries of the cervical spine in newborn infants. The information content of x-ray diagnosis and computer-aided tomography was studied and compared in 40 newborns aged 3 to 26 days. In these infants, the natal period was complicated by total and subtotal plexitis. It has been demonstrated that computer-aided tomography is the most informative method in etiological interpretation of the post-traumatic condition of the vertebral canal and spinal cord itself.
