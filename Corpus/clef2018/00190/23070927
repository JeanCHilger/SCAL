The role of aerodigestive tract endoscopy in penetrating neck trauma. To determine the role of aerodigestive tract endoscopy in the management of penetrating neck trauma.Retrospective case series.A search of the hospital's trauma database was performed for patients who presented with penetrating neck trauma between July 1989 and June 2008. The mechanism and site of injury, airway status and manipulation, physical findings, diagnostic and therapeutic steps taken, and outcomes were all recorded.One hundred sixty-three patients were identified. There were 144 males and 19 females. The mean age was 28 years (range, 13 to 65 years). There were 105 gunshot wounds, 9 shotgun injuries, and 48 stab wounds. Seventy-three patients (45%) underwent emergent neck exploration, of which 15 had upper aerodigestive tract injuries intraoperative endoscopy was performed on 13 and was used to guide the repair. Ninety patients (55%) did not meet the criteria for emergent neck exploration. Endoscopy in this group was performed in symptomatic patients, which revealed two cases of unilateral true vocal fold motion impairment, one mucosal laceration of the right mainstem bronchus, one questionable area of injury at the apical segment of the right upper lobe bronchus, and one mucosal laceration of the proximal esophagus.Aerodigestive tract endoscopy is critical in assessing and guiding surgical repair of injuries noted on surgical exploration. In stable patients with a low clinical suspicion of aerodigestive tract injury, it was of low yield. We propose a new algorithm for assessing aerodigestive tract injuries that includes multidetector computed tomography, in which only symptomatic patients who fail to meet the criteria for emergent neck exploration undergo endoscopy.4.
