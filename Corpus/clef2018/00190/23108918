C2/3 instability: unusual cause of cervical myelopathy in a child with Down syndrome. We report a rare cause of cervical myelopathy (CM) in a 10-year-old Down syndrome (DS) girl. She presented with progressive CM over 1Â year affecting her ability to ambulate or feed herself. The myelopathy was secondary to C2/3 instability. Surgical reduction and instrumented fusion have significantly improved her neurological status. This case emphasizes the importance of close follow-up of DS patients for early diagnosis and treatment of cervical spine abnormalities.
