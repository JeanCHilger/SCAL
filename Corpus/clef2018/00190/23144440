Case report: neurological complications associated with epidural analgesia in children: a report of 4 cases of ambiguous etiologies.

In this article we present a series of 4 cases of longterm or permanent neurologic complications associated with epidural analgesia. Possible mechanisms of injury and implications for practice are discussed.
