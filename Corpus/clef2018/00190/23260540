Determining skeletal maturation using insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) test. To investigate the validity of Insulin like Growth Factor -1(IGF-1) as a skeletal maturity indicator by comparing serum IGF-1 levels with the stages in cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) and in the middle phalanx of the third finger (MP3).The study population was selected by using simple random sampling technique and consisted of 30 female subjects in the age range of 8-23 years who had blood sample, cephalometric and MP3 radiographs taken on the same day. Serum IGF-I estimation was carried out on the blood samples using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) method. CVM was evaluated using method by Baccetti et al and MP3 staging was done using Rajagopal & Kansal method. Mean IGF-1 level between the stages was compared by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney test.Serum IGF-1 levels in females correlate well with skeletal maturity determined by CVM and MP3 stages and increase sharply during early pubertal stages followed by a decrease in late puberty. In addition we hypothesis that serum IGF-1 testing can be undertaken as a preliminary screening test in patients in whom the orthodontist predicts the possibility of using myofunctional appliance but in whom the chronologic age is not suggestive for a growth modification therapy.The finding of the study highlights the fact that the serum IGF-1 estimation can be a valuable tool in assessing skeletal maturation.
