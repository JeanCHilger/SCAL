Analysis of anterior cervical spondylodesis using plate cage PCB Evolution for a 2 year period. The aim of this study was to analyze treatment results of patients who underwent cervical fusion using plate cage PCB Evolution during 2 year period. 37 hybrid cages (titanium plate and PEEK cage) were implanted to 34 patients with degenerative disease of cervical spine. Assessment of results was performed by neurologic examination, neurovisualization data, visual analogue pain scale and Neck Disability Index. Mean duration of surgery was 92 min., blood loss - 42 ml, length of hospital stay - 8 days. Substantial decrease of frequency and intensity of neck and arm pain was observed after surgery in 91% of patients. Single asymptomatic complication occurred due to improper implant position owing to loosening of the upper screw. When properly performed, anterior cervical interbody fusion applying PCB Evolution plate cage is a simple and effective method with low complication rate.
