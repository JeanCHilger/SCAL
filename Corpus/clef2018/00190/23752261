Traumatic epidural retroclival hematoma with odontoid fracture and cardiorespiratory arrest. Case report.To describe a case or traumatic retroclival hematoma with features not previously reported.Single center.Description of a case, in the context of relevant literature on the subject.Traumatic retroclival hematomas are a rare, typically pediatric, entity. Only four cases of epidural hematoma in adult patients have been reported. We describe an additional case, the first with a fatal course in the acute setting. It is also the first retroclival hematoma associated to an odontoid base fracture.Retroclival hematomas are a rare diagnosis, to be considered in pediatric patients with flexion-extension, high-energy injuries. Morphology is typically epidural. Brain stem and cranial nerve symptoms are typical. Treatment is usually conservative. Outcome is regarded as favorable, with partial recovery and neurologic sequelae. Adult cases are extremely rare. The case we describe adds new characteristics to the scarcity of cases.
