Idiopathic intervertebral disc calcification in childhood: an atypical case of an uncommon entity for pediatric pathologists. Calcification of the intervertebral disc is a common occurrence in the adult population, but it is rare in children. However, its radiological and clinical findings are well described in the pediatric age group, with close to 150 publications on record. In contrast, little information is available regarding the histological features of this entity, which may prove to be challenging to surgical pathologists. Here we provide a detailed description of a young patient with an inflammatory retropharyngeal mass originating in a calcified intervertebral disc. A review of the pathological features described in the literature in English, with pathogenic considerations, is presented.
