A primary spinal extradural atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the cervical spine with bony involvement. Primary spinal atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors are extremely rare and most commonly occur as intramedural or extramedural intradural. The location of extradural type is rarely reported. A 10-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of nape pain. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extradural tumor from C2-C5 with bony destruction of the C3 vertebral body. Subtotal removal of the tumor was performed and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor was proven histologically. But 2 months after surgery, the neck pain became worse. There were metastasic lesions in bilateral lung fields and multiple enlarged lymph nodes around the carotid sheath. She died 8 months after the initial symptoms. The present case is the third detailed report of spinal extradural. We describe the CT and MRI findings of this case and review the literature describing this rare disease.
