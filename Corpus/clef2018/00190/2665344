Spinal dysraphia and disordered ascension of the spinal cord in adults. Spinal dysraphism and tethered cord syndrome which frequently present with clinical symptoms during infancy, childhood and adolescence are rarely encountered in adults. In this retrospective study covering a period of 15 years were report of 12 patients aged from 22 to 71 years with delayed symptoms from the tethered spinal cord. The clinical signs and symptoms which consisted of progressing neurological, urological and orthopedic malfunctions as well as the aspects of current neuroradiological diagnosis including myelography, CT-scan and MRI are presented. The possible pathophysiological mechanism responsible for the delayed onset of the sequelae of the tethered cord are discussed. It is concluded that neurosurgical therapy should be performed in cases of progressing clinical deterioration and the results of surgery in our patient group are presented.
