Multiple-level noncontiguous spinal fractures. Double-level noncontiguous spinal injury is a more common occurrence than generally appreciated. A large number of these patients have neurological injury. Because these injuries occur in patients who meet the criteria for categorization as multiple trauma patients, we feel that a complete radiographic survey of the spine must be accomplished in the emergency room in any situation where clinical assessment is impaired. Treatment must be individualized with the same guidelines for treatment as for the isolated injury in the majority of circumstances.
