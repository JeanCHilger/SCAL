MR imaging of the spine in children. MR imaging was reviewed in 66 pediatric spinal cord patients with diagnoses of posterior fossa tumor (n = 8), primary spinal cord tumor (n = 3), metastatic disease (n = 11), neuroectodermal disorder (n = 8), congenital malformation (n = 14), trauma (n = 2), and demyelinating, neurodegenerative, or metabolic disorders (n = 9). MR proved to be useful in delineating the extent of posterior fossa and cord tumor including metastasis to the cord. MR was of limited value in demyelinating and metabolic disorders. Arnold Chiari malformations, syringomyelia, tethered cord and meningoceles were all easily evaluated using MR.
