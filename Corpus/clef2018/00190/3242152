Spinal deviations in sports medicine practice. The examination of the spine in sportsmen is imperative. The anatomical configuration reveals the X-ray examination, where the radiation is, however, considerable. Our apparatus eliminates the danger of radiation, using a non-invasive method of examination, at the same time enabling to state the grade of curvature both in the frontal and the sagittal level. It also secures the standard posture at examination. The authors have also found the conclusive physiological deviation of the single curvatures of the spine, and examined various groups of sportsmen in which the grade of pathological curvature was evaluated.
