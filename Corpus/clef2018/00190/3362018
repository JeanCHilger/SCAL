Osteochondroma presenting as a neck mass: a case report. Osteochondromas are benign bone tumors which rarely present as neck masses. This report reviews the literature and presents the case of a 10-year-old girl with a neck mass and hoarseness due to an osteochondroma of the cervical spine. An extensive diagnostic evaluation and partial surgical excision were necessary. Although rare, osteochondromas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a firm neck mass. Surgical excision of these lesions is recommended.
