Spinal sonography in childhood. Indications and value in abnormalities and space-occupying lesions. Conditions, examination technique, and sonographic anatomy of the spinal canal are presented. The sonographical appearance of various kinds of dysraphism and their differentiation, of malformations at the cranio-cervical junction and of mass lesions is demonstrated and illustrated. Based on our preliminary experience spinal sonography appears to be useful as first imaging device for the differentiation of complex malformations, and as screening method for occult dysraphism. In case of mass lesions spinal sonography is suitable to diagnose and follow up disease although additional imaging procedures are currently needed for the confirmation of the diagnosis.
