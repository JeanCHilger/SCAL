Metastasizing chordoma in early childhood: a pathological and immunohistochemical study with review of the literature. A 2 1/2-year-old female with a sphenooccipital-vertebral chordoma presented with neck pain, torticollis, fever, a lytic lesion of C2 vertebra, and bilateral nodular infiltrates in the lung. The lung biopsy revealed multiple tumor emboli by an enigmatic epithelioid-appearing neoplasm with immunohistochemical staining for vimentin, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen. A thorough roentgenographic evaluation disclosed a destructive, prepontine mass in the region of the clivus, erosion of the odontoid process, and compression of the cervical spinal cord. The patient died after a clinical course of 3 months. We identified 16 additional cases of metastasizing chordomas in the pediatric-age population this case is the first to our knowledge with pathologically documented pulmonary metastasis at presentation.
