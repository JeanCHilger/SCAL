Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva presenting as osteomyelitis-like syndrome. An 8-year-old boy presenting with fever, neck pain, and torticollis was eventually diagnosed as having fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The initial bone scan was interpreted as being suggestive of vertebral osteomyelitis. Subsequent computerized tomographic studies (CT scan), however, demonstrated paravertebral soft-tissue calcification adjacent to, but not involving, intact cervical vertebrae. The acute process of FOP was thereby distinguished from that of osteomyelitis by use of CT scan.
