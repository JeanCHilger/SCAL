Chronic repetitive unrecognized flexion injury of the cervical spine (high jumper's neck). Unrecognized flexion injuries of the cervical spine may lead to late instability and neurologic damage. These hidden flexion injuries may be from acute or chronic traumatic episodes. Cervical spine instability was seen in an amateur high jumper as a result of chronic repetitive flexion loading of her cervical spine due to incorrect landing technique. The instability from these types of flexion injuries is generally unrecognized on a routine lateral radiograph. The presence of slight anterior subluxation, simple compression fractures, or subtle kyphotic angulation at one cervical level should alert the physician to this diagnosis. Flexion extension views are useful to demonstrate this instability. Occupations and sports which involve repetitive flexion stress to the cervical spine are at risk for this type of late instability. Therefore, in high jumping careful attention to safe techniques of landing is of utmost importance.
