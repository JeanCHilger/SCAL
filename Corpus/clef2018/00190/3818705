Occipito-atlantal instability in children. A report of five cases and review of the literature. We are reporting the cases of five patients who had occipito-atlantal instability, a rare condition that may be due to either trauma or congenital abnormalities. In three of the patients the instability was secondary to trauma. The clinical and neurological manifestations were varied and included cardiorespiratory arrest, motor weakness, quadriplegia, torticollis, pain in the neck, vertigo, and projectile vomiting. All of the patients underwent posterior arthrodesis of the occiput to the first or second cervical vertebra. In the patients who had trauma-related instability, surgery was performed when immobilization in a cast failed to stabilize the spine in the patients who had a congenital abnormality, arthrodesis was indicated because of persistent symptoms and the potential for catastrophe with minor trauma. Based on our experience, we recommend surgical stabilization by posterior arthrodesis when this form of instability of the cervical spine is diagnosed.
