Cardiovascular instability following acute cervical spinal cord trauma. Irregularities in vital sign (pulse, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm) recordings are commonly observed following acute spinal cord injury. These abnormalities have been generally attributed to autonomic instability. However, there have been no clinical reports that evaluate these problems in a large group of acutely injured patients. Therefore, this study was performed on 45 patients with acute cervical spinal cord injuries to evaluate the incidence, severity, and risk factors for cardiovascular instability. This investigation revealed that there is a direct correlation between the severity of the cord injury and the incidence and severity of cardiovascular problems. Endotracheal suctioning with or without documented hypoxia are major causes of severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest within the first 2 weeks after trauma. Careful monitoring of severely injured patients and attention to the warning signs of cardiovascular instability can reduce the risk of life-threatening emergencies.
