Complications of sublaminar wiring. Complications of sublaminar wiring are reported, including four cases that involved the cervical spine and one case that included the thoracolumbar spine. The complication rate at our institution involving the cervical spine was about 7% and less than 1% for the thoracic spine. A direct correlation exists between the degree of anterior bowing, number of consecutive laminae the wire passes beneath, and the complication rate. The clinical presentations, radiologic findings, and indications for surgical removal of the wires are discussed. To our knowledge, nothing has been reported in the literature regarding the complications caused by sublaminar wiring of consecutive vertebrae.
