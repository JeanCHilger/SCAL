X-ray computed tomographic aspects of spinal aneurysmal cysts in children. The interest of CT imaging in a case of aneurysmal bone cyst of the posterior arch of the 6th cervical vertebra in a 10 y.o. child is underlined. The value of intra tumoral densities which are relatively low, inferior to 100 Hounsfield unit is stressed but the most contributory feature in this case was the presence of a fluid level inside the cyst due to different densities of fluid components into the cyst.
