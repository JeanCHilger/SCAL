Cervical vertebrae subluxation. Rotary subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint is an uncommon complication of head and neck surgery and infections. Reported sequelae of this disorder range from torticollis to death from compression of the spinal cord. Two cases of C1-C2 rotary subluxation will be discussed. These complications occurred following otitis media, repair of choanal atresia, and an adenoidectomy. The literature is reviewed.
