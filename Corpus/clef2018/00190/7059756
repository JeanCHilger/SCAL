Dynamic urethral function in the assessment of spinal injury patients. Forty-two spinal injury patients underwent single or sequential urodynamic studies to assess the value of dynamic urethral pressure using transducer tipped catheters. Three groups of patients were identified: those with poor detrusor function, those with unsustained dyssynergia and those with sustained dyssynergia. All patients demonstrated some dyssynergia. Urethral needle EMG mirrored urethral pressure changes accurately. The addition of dynamic profilometry to fluoroscopy, detrusor pressure and urethral EMG has clarified our understanding of lower urinary tract behaviour after cord lesions.
