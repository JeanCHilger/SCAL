The role of polytomography in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical spine injuries. Ninety-one sets of polytomograms were analyzed for diagnosis and treatment of 123 patients with cervical spine injuries. Pluridirectional polytomographis is valuable in evaluation of acute cervical spine injuries when the findings on plain roentgenograms do not correlate well with the clinical symptoms and signs. The polytomographic study had a dramatic impact on the diagnosis and a lesser but nevertheless significant impact on the treatment of cervical spine injuries. Polytomograms were especially valuable for the diagnosis and treatment of atlantoaxial injuries.
