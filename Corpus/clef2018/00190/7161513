Detrusor inactivity in central spinal cord lesions. Hypothesis of inhibitory hyperreflexia of sympathetic origin. In connection with two observations of suprasacral complete spinal cord patients showing a clear sublesional spasticity and paradoxically and inactive and unreactive detrusor, the authors discuss the mechanisms that are usually considered: vesical distension, sacral peripheric neurogenic lesion, reflex inhibition of the detrusor of somatic origin. They express the hypothesis of an inhibition hyper-reflex of sympathetic origin, reversible under phenoxybenzamine treatment, consider the urodynamic evaluation and the therapeutic treatment and compare this type of neurogenic vesical dysfunction to that of the spinal shock.
