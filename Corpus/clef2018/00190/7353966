Intercostal muscle reflexes and sleep breathing patterns in the human infant. Breathing variability and apnea characteristic of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was investigated in a newborn infant with complete interruption of intercostal to phrenic neural pathways due to intrapartem transection of the cervical spinal cord. Breath-to-breath variability in inspiratory duration (TI), breath duration (Ttot), tidal volume (VT), and ventilation (VI) was significantly greater in REM than in quiet sleep and was similar to the variability in these parameters seen in normal infants. In addition, brief periods of diaphragmeatic apnea were observed during REM sleep. The phenomenon of shortened TI during airway occlusion previously attributed to intercostal-to-phrenic reflexes was examined in the quadriplegic infant and in seven healthy term infants. The frequency of this response was increased when airway occlusion was delayed until after onset of inspiration. Shortening of TI by occlusion occurred no less frequently in the quadriplegic than in the control infants. The constant paradoxical inward movement of the rib cage during inspiration observed in the quadriplegic infant suggests that supraspinal innervation of intercostal muscle limits such paradoxical movements in the normal infant. The quadriplegic infant's end-expiratory volume was consistently above his passive functional residual capacity, as inferred from respiratory volume and pressure measurements.
