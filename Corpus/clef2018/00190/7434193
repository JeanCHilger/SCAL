Aneurysmal bone cyst of the cervical spine: a twelve-year follow-up after surgical treatment. In 1967 a 14-year-old boy underwent anterior cervical stabilization and subtotal removal of an aneurysmal bone cyst of the cervical spine. A complete reversal of his neurological deficit followed and has been maintained during a 12-year-period without radiation therapy. An early demonstration of the angiographic appearance of this rare lesion is presented.
