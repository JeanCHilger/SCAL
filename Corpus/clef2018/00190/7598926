Atlantooccipital dislocation: a case report. We report on a child who suffered an atlantooccipital dislocation and survived. The patient required tracheostomy and feeding gastrostomy due to retropharyngeal swelling from a traumatic pseudomeningocele. He later underwent fusion of his occiput to C3. The complications of such an injury and the anesthetic management are discussed.
