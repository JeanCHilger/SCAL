Diagnostic value of myeloscintigraphy in lesions and diseases of the spine. Twenty-seven myeloscintigraphic examinations were carried out in 24 patients aged 6 to 66 with various diseases and involvements of the spine. Seven patients suffered from scoliosis complicated by neurologic symptoms, 2 from compression fractures of the L2 vertebra, 1 from a benign tumor of the spinal cord, 13 from various dislocations of the upper cervical segments of the spine, and 1 from a chronic fracture of the spinous process of C2 vertebra. Myeloscintigraphic examinations revealed different disorders of the spinal cord subarachnoidal space patency. The findings evidence higher diagnostic potentialities of myeloscintigraphy in a number of cases as against x-ray contrast myelography, for it permits the detection of patency disorders in the spinal subarachnoidal space, undetectable by x-ray contrast myelography.
