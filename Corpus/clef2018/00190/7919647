Intracanalicular osteochondroma producing spinal cord compression in hereditary multiple exostoses. Spinal cord compression is an unusual but potentially catastrophic manifestation of hereditary multiple exostoses (HMEs). Isolated, osteochondromas are usually of little significance. However, if they are located near neurologic structures, they may cause irritation due to mechanical compression. In patients with HMEs who present with neck or back pain, and particularly in those who have neurologic symptoms in the upper or lower extremities, a diagnosis of intracanalicular osteochondroma should be presumed until proven otherwise. Prompt diagnosis and surgical excision affords the best prognosis for these patients who have spinal cord compression secondary to intracanalicular osteochondroma.
