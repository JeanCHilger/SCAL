Use of full-thickness calvarial bone grafts for cervical spinal fusions in pediatric patients. The use of full-thickness calvarial bone grafts for cervical spinal fusions appears to be effective and safe in pediatric patients requiring stabilization of the cervical spine. The grafts create solid fusions, better immediate internal stabilization, and the procedure is associated with less morbidity than those using autologous grafts of rib or iliac crest.
