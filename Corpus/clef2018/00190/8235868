Intraoperative use of the mobile gamma camera in localizing and excising osteoid osteomas of the spine. Three patients (ages 12, 13, and 15 years) had histologically verified osteoid osteomas of the spine (specifically in the facet processes of L3, L2, and C5) which were localized preoperatively with nuclear scintigraphy utilizing technetium 99m diphosphonate. Intraoperative nuclear scintigraphy utilizing the mobile gamma camera was essential in both localizing the tumor during surgical excision and ensuring adequacy of excision. The authors strongly recommend intraoperative scintigraphy, and en bloc resection rather than shelling out and curettage. All three patients required facet process excision for successful tumor removal, and therefore required local fusion with internal fixation.
