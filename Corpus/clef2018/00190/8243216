SCIWORA syndrome: nursing assessment. Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Abnormality (SCIWORA) is a commonly misdiagnosed injury in children and adolescents. Failure to recognize SCIWORA can lead to additional injury. The critical care nurse recognizes the risk of SCIWORA, conducts a complete neurologic assessment on children experiencing cervical trauma, and provides immediate immobilization to prevent further neurologic complications. These pediatric neurosurgical and trauma nurse authors describe the nurse's role and include a SCIWORA case study in this article.
