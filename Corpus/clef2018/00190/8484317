Fractures of the odontoid process. Conservative and operative treatment. Prognostic factors. In a retrospective study 33 fractures of the dens were analyzed. Nonoperative treatment was successful in types I and III, but unsuccessful in 48.5% of type II fractures. In addition to the poor outcome factors of Schatzker, the classification of Roy-Camille is a valuable prognostic factor.
