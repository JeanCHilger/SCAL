Outcome of head injury in 2298 patients treated in a single clinic during a 21-year period. Between 1968 and 1988, 2298 head-injured patients of all grades of severity were registered in the data bank of a single clinic. The majority of patients were admitted to a community hospital and transferred later to the neurosurgical clinic. The data included mechanism of injury and clinical status at admission, including the level of consciousness according to the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) before and after resuscitation. After admission, nearly all patients below a score of 8 were intubated and treated with controlled ventilation until the patient awakened, died, or had remained in a steady state for approximately 3 weeks. Assessment of the final outcome was made according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) both at discharge and again after the patient's status was stabilized. The results show a stable yearly outcome during the 21 years of recording but a significantly improved good recovery and mortality rate when compared with our previous results. Outcome was significantly correlated to age and type and severity of lesion, as judged by the postresuscitation GCS. The outcome of the 1264 most severely injured, comatose patients (GCS < 9) shows a good recovery rate of 55%, a severely disabled rate of 14%, a vegetative rate of 7%, and a mortality rate of 24%. We attribute these results, which compare favorably with others, to prompt airway control and controlled ventilation in unconscious patients.
