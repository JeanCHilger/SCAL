Fractures and dislocations encountered by the general surgeon: general principles. The definitive treatment selected for the care of a fracture is dependent upon what will offer the best cosmesis and function for the individual patient. Closed reductions and immobilization which require the joints to be in abnormal positions may offer an anatomic reduction but after the fracture is healed, joint function may be poor. Consequently, immobilization in the functional position with early motion and acceptance of some deformity is often better in terms of the ultimate use of the extremity. Traction treatment which requires prolonged recumbency is dangerous in the elderly because of the threat of thromboembolic phenomena and pneumonia. Therefore, open reduction and internal fixation with early mobilization of such patients is preferred. The type of treatment used is based on an evaluation of the entire patient and not just the radiographic interpretation of the fracture.
