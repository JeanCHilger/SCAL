Clinico-radiologic correlations in common neck pain. Patients with spontaneous neck pain, headache, dizziness and/or pain to the upper limbs are frequently observed. Common cervicodynia, due to the involvement of arthromuscular structures of the cervical spine, was diagnosed in the patients with these symptoms in the absence of trauma or neurologic signs. The authors investigated the clinical-radiologic correlation in a series of 130 symptomatic patients and considered it a metameric disorder. The frequent association of many radiographic signs at the same level often prevents single radiographic signs from being assessed individually therefore, the authors selected some patients with just one radiographic change per functional unit, to assess its relationship with clinical symptoms. The patients underwent anteroposterior, lateral and functional (flexion-extension) radiographs of the cervical spine. Vertebral rotation, detected on antero-posterior views as a spinous process deviation, was the most frequent isolated sign (79/130 cases) per metameric level, with strong clinical correlation (70/79 cases). Vertebral rotation was probably due to unilateral muscular stiffness. Other single radiologic signs per functional unit with strong clinical correlation follow: atloaxial rotation (13/130 with clinical-radiologic agreement of 12/13), functional blockage (13/130 with clinical-radiologic agreement of 11/13), angular flexion (21/130 with clinical-radiologic agreement of 19/21) and overall disc space thinning (12/130 with clinical-radiologic agreement of 10/12). Atloaxial rotation is represented as an asymmetry of the spaces between the odontoid and the lateral masses of the atlas
