Hypertransfusion for spinal cord compression secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis. A 19-year-old girl with thalassemia intermedia presented with signs of thoracic spinal cord compression secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis. She was started on a transfusion regimen to maintain a hemoglobin level of more than 12.5 g/dL. Clinical signs disappeared within the first week and circulating erythroblastemia was completely suppressed by the second week. Magnetic resonance imaging 4 weeks after diagnosis revealed near-complete resolution of the extradural mass, followed by gradual improvement in the posterior tibial somatosensory evoked potentials. Transfusion therapy may be diagnostically and therapeutically useful in spinal cord compression secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis, obviating the need for surgery or radiotherapy.
