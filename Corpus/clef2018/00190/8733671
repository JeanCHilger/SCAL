Missed cervical spine injury following barflying. The case is reported of a young woman who suffered a wedge fracture of C7 due to axial loading with a flexed spine, in an injury caused by barfly jumping. The fracture was unstable and required surgical stabilisation. In this case the seriousness of the injury was not realised at first because neck radiographs were not taken at her initial assessment in accident and emergency.
