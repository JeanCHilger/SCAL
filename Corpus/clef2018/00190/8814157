Somatosensory evoked potential monitoring in cervical surgery: identification of pre- and intraoperative risk factors associated with neurological deterioration. Cortical and subcortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were noninvasively monitored in 191 surgical procedures involving the cervical spine. In nine patients in the poorest neurological condition, SSEPs could not be monitored. Lower limb SSEPs were often too degraded to be useful. Upper limb responses were reliably recorded in 182 procedures, with a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 27% in 10 patients who developed neurological signs postsurgery. The aim of monitoring was to detect changes in spinal cord function at a time when neurological deterioration could be prevented or reversed, and these studies alerted the authors to certain clinical and SSEP risk factors associated with deterioration. Clinical and operative risk factors were: 1) poor pre-operative neurological function (one-third of Ranawat Class IIIb patients deteriorated) 2) use of instrumentation (the risk doubled in preoperatively unimpaired patients)
