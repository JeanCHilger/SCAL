Short-term effect of pudendal nerve electrical stimulation on detrusor hyperreflexia in spinal cord injury patients: importance of current strength. Twenty patients with chronic suprasacral spinal cord injury presenting with detrusor hyperreflexia were examined. In a preliminary study in ten patients we investigated the reproducibility of bladder capacity through the repetition of three cystometries. The effect of electrical stimulation (ES) on detrusor hyperreflexia was then investigated in ten patients during three consecutive cystometries, the first one without ES (baseline) and the other two with continuous ES of the dorsal penile or clitoris nerve via surface electrodes. Parameters of stimulation were 5 Hz frequency, 0.50 msec pulse duration, and stimulation strength of 1 and 2 times the bulbocavernosus reflex threshold. No significant differences in bladder capacity were found between the three consecutive cystometries without ES (respectively 97.0 ml, 101.5 ml and 105.6 ml). A current at the bulbocavernosus threshold (mean 24.4 mA) failed to induce a significant increase in bladder capacity compared to baseline (173.0 ml vs 155.5 ml, P = 0.17) whereas a current of twice the bulbocavernosus threshold (mean 48.9 mA) was highly significant (318.5 ml vs 155.5 ml, P < 0.007). ES of twice the threshold resulted in perineal contraction in all of the patients, the threshold ES never did. Our results emphasise the decisive roles of perineal contraction and of current strength for achieving short-term bladder inhibition in spinal cord injury patients. The carry-over effect may also be dependent on the current strength. If so, maximal pudendal ES could represent an alternative procedure in the treatment of detrusor hyperreflexia in these patients.
