Posterolateral decompression and stabilization of thoracolumbar injuries using Diapason instrumentation. The authors describe a series of 28 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury who were decompressed via a posterolateral approach and stabilized with a new material for osteosynthesis called Diapason. Similarly to other osteosynthesis systems, it combines the advantages of pedicular fixation and rod stabilization. All patients were studied pre- and postoperative by plain X-ray films, standard and 3-D CT scan. The sagittal index (S.I.) was calculated in all patients to quantify segmental sagittal deformity. Patient follow-up ranged from 1 to 3 years. Twenty-two patients who presented with neurological deficit improved (78.5%). Twenty-six patients (92.8%) developed osseous union and 5 patients with spinal deformity (S.I. > 15 degrees) presented a postoperative S.I. of less than 5 degrees at long-term check-up S.I. underwent a current of 2 degrees in one patient only but it remained stable at subsequent controls. Instrument failure occurred in 4 cases (screw breakage in 1 case, rod displacement in 3) but only one required reoperation because the others were asymptomatic and presented solid fusions.
