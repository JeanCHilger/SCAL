Strength post-spinal cord injury: myometer vs manual muscle test. This study was designed to compare changes in strength after spinal cord injury (SCI) with the use of a hand held myometer to the manual muscle test (MMT). Eighty-eight C4-C8 Frankel A-D tetraplegic subjects were tested at various times up to 2 years post-SCI. Elbow flexor strength on successive examinations were grouped according to their early and later MMT scores (3.5 with no change in MMT. 3.5 to 4.0, and 3.5 to 4.5 4.0 with no change in MMT, 4.0 to 4.5, and 4.0 to 5.0
