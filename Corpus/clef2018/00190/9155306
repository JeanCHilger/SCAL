Trauma to the neck and larynx. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons from 8 months to 44 years of age. The precise incidence of neck trauma is unknown. Autopsy studies have shown that the majority of the individuals with a major airway injury die at the scene of the accident, as a result of asphyxia caused by interruption or obstruction of the airway, compounded by aspiration of blood and intrapulmonary hemorrhage. A neck traumatized patient thoroughly challenges the practitioner's ability to coordinate, diagnose, and rapidly formulate a proper method of treatment.
