Severe trauma in children. Trauma are responsible for approximately 50% of the deaths of the pediatric population between 1-15 years of age. This high mortality rate, associated with frequent sequelae, leading sometimes to severe handicaps, is a major problem of public health in the developed countries. Pediatric trauma have some particularities, due to anatomical and physiological differences, and to specific injury mechanisms. Management of a patient with severe trauma is best performed by trained physicians, working in a multidisciplinary team with a two steps approach: 1) emergency rapid clinical assessment and resuscitation. 2) a secondary complete clinical evaluation associated with medical imaging, mainly based on CT scan. Head injuries are frequent and represent the main prognosis factor, mass lesions being less frequent and cerebral oedema more frequent in children, than in adult brain swelling appears to be less frequent than initially reported. Management of head trauma has evolved in recent years, and is now largely directed towards the prevention of secondary ischemic brain injury: new monitoring devices are proposed to pursue that goal: transcranial doppler and continuous jugular vein oxygen saturation monitoring. Spinal cord injuries are rare but may be severe: cervical and spinal cord injuries without radiological abnormality (SC/WORA) appear to be more frequent than in adult. Most often, abdominal plain viscera injuries are treated with a conservative non operative approach. Among chest injuries, pulmonary contusion is the most frequent, with a favorable outcome in most cases within 3-4 days. Child abuse must be suspected in any case where there is no clear injury mechanism or when there is a discrepancy between the severity of the injury and the alleged mechanism.
