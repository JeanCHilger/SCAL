Anteriorly displaced transverse fractures of the sacrum in adolescents: report of two cases. A fracture of the sacrum at the level of the first and second segments, with forward displacement of the first segment, is a very rare injury in adolescents. The cases of two patients, who both suffered a displaced transverse fracture of the sacrum with resulting neural disturbance, are reported here. We consider that these unstable fractures may be treated surgically, by extensive laminectomies of the lumbosacral area and posterolateral fusion. Stabilization of the displaced fracture is possibly preferable, because it provides the prerequisites for early mobilization and reduces pain.
