Long-term suprapubic catheterisation: clinical outcome and satisfaction survey. We report on the clinical outcome and satisfaction survey of long-term suprapubic catheterisation in patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction. Between early 1988 and later 1995, 185 suprapubic catheters were inserted under direct cystoscopic vision. Anti-cholinergic therapy was given to all patients with significant detrusor hyper-reflexia the catheters clamped daily for two hours and changed every six weeks. Ultrasonography and assessment of the serum creatinine were used to assess the upper renal tracts, and the results of the pre- and post-catheter video-cystometrography was used to evaluate bladder morphology, cystometric capacity, maximum detrusor pressure and the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux. There were equivalent numbers of males and females. The follow-up ranges from 3-68 months. Following catheterisation, there was a 50% reduction in the average maximum detrusor pressure, bladder morphology improved in 85% of the cases
