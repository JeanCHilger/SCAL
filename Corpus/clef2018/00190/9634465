Head-wag autotomography of the upper cervical spine in infantile torticollis. Infants with torticollis require evaluation of the entire cervical spine for vertebral anomalies as part of the work-up, but open-mouth views to assess occiput to C2 are difficult to obtain.To evaluate a "head wag" autotomographic technique for the frontal projection of this region.Twenty infants under one year of age were evaluated using this technique.Sixteen of 20 could be adequately evaluated using this simple, low-radiation-dose procedure.For infants with torticollis in whom vertebral anomalies need to be excluded, the "head wag" technique is useful.
