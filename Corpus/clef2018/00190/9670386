Functional evaluation using motor scores after cervical spinal cord injuries. Patient evaluation using Zancolli's classification for cervical cord injuries uses easily understood criteria and accurately defines the state of disability in Frankel grade A or B patients. However, this classification cannot be used in Frankel grade C patients even though they also cannot walk. We compared the Zancolli classification with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores in evaluating self-care in Frankel grade C patients. The Zancoli classification was found to correlate closely with the ASIA motor score. The threshold of ability to perform self-care in areas such as urinary toileting and wheelchair mobility occurred approximately between C6A and C6B 1 in the Zancolli classification in Frankel grade A and B patients and at the level of about 30 points in the ASIA motor score in Frankel grade C patients. The ASIA motor score is helpful in defining functional motor status in Frankel grade C patients with cervical spinal cord injuries.
