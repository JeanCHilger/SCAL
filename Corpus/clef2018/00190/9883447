Application of ultrafast 3D-CT in cervical spine injury. The authors investigated the usefulness of the ultrafast three-dimensional computed tomography (UF-3D-CT) in cervical spine injury. At Osaka City General Hospital, between April 1995 and March 1998, the authors examined 38 patients with cervical spine injury using UF-3D-CT. The ultrafast CT reduces scanning time. There were no complications associated with the examination. We examined 12 patients with vertebral body fracture, 11 patients with lamina fracture, 8 cases with subluxation including locking facet, 2 patients with atlanto-axial dislocation and 8 patients without bony abnormality. Results suggested that UF-3D-CT was very useful for helping us to understand the bony deformity and the relationship between the bone and the important vessels. UF-3D-CT is very useful for preoperative evaluation and pathophysiological evaluation in cervical spin injury.
