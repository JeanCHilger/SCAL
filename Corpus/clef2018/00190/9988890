The assessment of the dynamics of somatosensory evoked potentials in the surgical and conservative treatment of patients following spinal and spinal cord trauma. Somatosensory evoked potentials at the cortical and spinal levels were dynamically studied in patients with vertebral column and spinal cord injuries before and after radical reparative surgery. The study showed that quantitative determination of the time course of changes occurring was highly effective in neurological disorders. Most significant were changes in the latent periods and amplitude of the peaks N11, N13, N20, P23 in the activation of n. medianus and N21, N28, P37, N45 in the bilateral stimulation of n. tibialis posterior. There was a correlation of neurophysiological and clinical manifestations in 50-60% of cases. Thus, the neurophysiological studies quantitatively verify the efficiency of surgical treatment for vertebral column and spinal cord injuries.
