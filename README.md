# (Refactor in Progress) Systematic Identification of Scientific Articles with Reduced user Effort

**NOTE:** Previously work were made in [mvtodescato's CAL fork](https://github.com/mvtodescato/CAL), however, since we don't intend to merge it with the original upstream, we decided to create another repository, therefore all modifications since 5 March, 2020 was made in this repository.
