First found in several viruses, it is now believed to exist in all kingdoms of life. Strong stimulators for −1 PRF are a heptameric slippery site and an RNA pseudoknot. Here, we present a new algorithm KnotInFrame, for the automatic detection of −1 PRF signals from genomic sequences. It finds the frameshifting stimulators by means of a specialized RNA-pseudoknot folding program, fast enough for genome-wide analyses. Evaluations on known −1 PRF signals demonstrate a high sensitivity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
