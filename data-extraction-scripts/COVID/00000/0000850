<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-02-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Rapid Genome Sequencing of RNA Viruses</TITLE><BODY>We developed a system for rapid determination of viral RNA sequences whereby genomic sequence is obtained from cultured virus isolates without subcloning into plasmid vectors. This method affords new opportunities to address the challenges of unknown or untypeable emerging viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
