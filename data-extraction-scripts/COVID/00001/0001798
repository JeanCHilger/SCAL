<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-03-24</DATELINE><TITLE>An Updated Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method for Rapid Diagnosis of H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses</TITLE><BODY>We designed a new set of primers for reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RTLAMP) to specifically amplify the HA gene of avian influenza viruses subtype H5N1. By testing nine H5N1 virus strains and 41 clinical samples collected in Northern Vietnam, we found that the new primers showed higher sensitivity and specificity than the previously published RT-LAMP primers and were comparable to the RT-PCR method currently recommended by WHO. These results suggest that our RT-LAMP assay may be a better choice as a diagnostic tool for current H5N1 influenza virus infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
