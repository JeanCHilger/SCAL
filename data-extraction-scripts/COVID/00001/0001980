<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-02-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Usefulness of Published PCR Primers in Detecting Human Rhinovirus Infection</TITLE><BODY>We conducted a preliminary comparison of the relative sensitivity of a cross-section of published human rhinovirus (HRV)â€“specific PCR primer pairs, varying the oligonucleotides and annealing temperature. None of the pairs could detect all HRVs in 2 panels of genotyped clinical specimens; >1 PCR is required for accurate description of HRV epidemiology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
