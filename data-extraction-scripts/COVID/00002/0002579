<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-12-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Bushmeat Hunting, Deforestation, and Prediction of Zoonotic Disease</TITLE><BODY>Understanding the emergence of new zoonotic agents requires knowledge of pathogen biodiversity in wildlife, human-wildlife interactions, anthropogenic pressures on wildlife populations, and changes in society and human behavior. We discuss an interdisciplinary approach combining virology, wildlife biology, disease ecology, and anthropology that enables better understanding of how deforestation and associated hunting leads to the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
