In Belgium, the reference laboratories performed their activities on a voluntary basis and lacked a legal status. METHODS: Pathogens or groups of pathogens necessitating a national reference center (NRC) were prioritized based on diagnostic and epidemiologic relevance. Terms of reference for each of these pathogens were developed. RESULTS: Recently, 40 NRCs for different pathogens or groups of pathogens have been installed in Belgium to fulfill the following core functions: offering reference diagnostics, collecting reference materials, sharing information and scientific advice, participating in national and international networks, collaborating with research workgroups, and contributing to surveillance activities. CONCLUSIONS: These NRCs are important focal points of the national and international network in public health microbiology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
