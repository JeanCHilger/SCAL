These processes are viewed primarily as cellular degradative pathways that recycle macromolecules and dysfunctional or redundant organelles into amino acids, sugars and lipids, especially during starvation. However, the ubiquitin-like autophagy proteins and other components of the autophagic machinery additionally participate in cellular reprogramming. We highlight these non-autophagic roles of autophagy proteins with the aim of drawing attention to this growing, but unexplored, research topic. We focus on the non-autophagic functions of autophagy proteins in cell survival and apoptosis, modulation of cellular traffic, protein secretion, cell signalling, transcription, translation and membrane reorganization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
