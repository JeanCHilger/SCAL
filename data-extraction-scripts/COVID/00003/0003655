<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-12-14</DATELINE><TITLE>The broad-spectrum antiviral functions of IFIT and IFITM proteins</TITLE><BODY>Over the past few years, several groups have identified novel genes downstream of type I interferon (IFN) signaling that inhibit infection by individual or multiple families of viruses. Among these IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral activity are two genetically and functionally distinct families â€” IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) and IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM). This review focuses on recent advances in identifying the unique mechanisms of action of IFIT and IFITM genes, which explain their broad-spectrum activity against replication, spread, and disease pathogenesis of a range of human viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
