Compared to controls, H1N1/09 patients showed increased expression of inflammatory pathway genes and reduced expression of adaptive immune pathway genes. This was validated on an independent cohort. The most significant function distinguishing H1N1/09 patients from controls was protein synthesis, with reduced gene expression. Reduced expression of protein synthesis genes also characterized the H1N1/09 expression profile compared to children with RSV and bacterial infection, suggesting that this is a key component of the pathophysiological response in children hospitalized with H1N1/09 infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
