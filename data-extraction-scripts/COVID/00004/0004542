She subsequently completed 72 weeks of natural IFN-β plus ribavirin therapy without remarkable adverse effects and achieved a sustained viral response, suggesting differences in the pharmacological properties and biological effects of IFN-α and IFN-β. Thus, natural IFN-β plus ribavirin therapy may be a treatment option for patients with poor tolerance to IFN-α or pegIFN-α treatments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
