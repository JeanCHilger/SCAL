<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Genome Sequence of Torovirus Identified from a Pig with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus from the United States</TITLE><BODY>Porcine torovirus (PToV) strain PToV-NPL/2013 was identified from a pig that tested positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The spike protein-encoding gene from PToV-NPL/2013 had 92% identity with PToV-SH1, suggesting that PToV circulating in the United States is slightly different from the isolates circulating in China. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PToV in the United States.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
