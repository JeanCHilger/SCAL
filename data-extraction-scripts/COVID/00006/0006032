<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete Genome Sequence of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Variant CH/HNYF/2014</TITLE><BODY>Sowâ€™s milk is a potential route for the vertical transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) from sow to suckling piglet. We report here the complete genome sequence of PEDV strain CH/HNYF/2014, which was isolated from milk samples. This information provides further understanding of the transmission mechanisms and genetic diversity of PEDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
