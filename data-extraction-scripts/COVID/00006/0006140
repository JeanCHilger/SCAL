<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Shedding and Environmental Cleaning in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection</TITLE><BODY>Viral shedding lasted 31 and 19 days from symptom onset in two patients with east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pneumonia, respectively. Environmental real-time RT-PCR was weakly positive for bed guardrail and monitors. Even after cleaning the monitors with 70% alcohol-based disinfectant, RT-PCR was still weakly positive, and converted to negative only after wiping with diluted sodium chlorite. Further studies are required to clarify the appropriate methods to clean environments during and after treatment of patients with MERS-CoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
