<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-11-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Design, Synthesis, and Antiviral Activity of Novel Ribonucleosides of 1,2,3‐Triazolylbenzyl‐aminophosphonates</TITLE><BODY>A novel series of ribonucleosides of 1,2,3‐triazolylbenzyl‐aminophosphonates was synthesized through the Kabachnik–Fields reaction using I(2) as catalyst followed by copper‐catalyzed cycloaddition of the azide–alkyne reaction (CuAAC). All structures of the newly prepared compounds were characterized by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, and HRMS spectra. The structures of 2e, 2f, 3d, and 3g were further confirmed by X‐ray diffraction analysis. These compounds were tested against various strains of DNA and RNA viruses; compounds 4b and 4c showed a modest inhibitory activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and compound 4h displayed modest inhibitory activity against Coxsackie virus B4.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
