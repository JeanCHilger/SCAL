<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-07-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Multiplexed Molecular Diagnostics for Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, and Central Nervous System Infections</TITLE><BODY>The development and implementation of highly multiplexed molecular diagnostic tests have allowed clinical microbiology laboratories to more rapidly and sensitively detect a variety of pathogens directly in clinical specimens. Current US Food and Drug Administrationâ€“approved multiplex panels target multiple different organisms simultaneously and can identify the most common pathogens implicated in respiratory viral, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system infections. This review summarizes the test characteristics of available assays, highlights the advantages and limitations of multiplex technology for infectious diseases, and discusses potential utilization of these new tests in clinical practice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
