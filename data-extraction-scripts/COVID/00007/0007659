The successful resolution of infection and avoidance of autoimmunity necessitates efficient and timely communication between autophagy and pathways that sense the immune environment. In this article, progress in elucidating mechanisms of crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory signaling cascades will be reviewed. The recent literature indicates that a variety of immune mediators induce or repress autophagy. It is also becoming increasing clear that immune signaling cascades are subject to regulation by autophagy, and that a return to homeostasis following a robust immune response is critically dependent on this pathway. Importantly, examples of non-canonical forms of autophagy in mediating immunity are pervasive. Improved mechanistic understanding of the autophagy machinery offers hope for treating infectious and inflammatory diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
