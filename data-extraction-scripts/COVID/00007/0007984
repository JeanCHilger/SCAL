<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-05-10</DATELINE><TITLE>The Broad Host Range and Genetic Diversity of Mammalian and Avian Astroviruses</TITLE><BODY>Astroviruses are a diverse family of viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts. Here we describe the phylogenetic diversity and current classification methodology of astroviruses based on the ORF1b and ORF2 genes, highlighting the propensity of astroviruses to undergo interspecies transmission and genetic recombination which greatly increase diversity and complicate attempts at a unified and comprehensive classification strategy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
