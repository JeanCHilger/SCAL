One presented with upper airway signs, and was identified to have a focal laryngeal lesion. The other had central neurological signs at the terminal stages, with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies identified within the cerebral hemispheres on histopathology. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Currently, cowpox would be an unlikely consideration in patients with neurological signs or upper respiratory noise. These cases both document novel presentations of cowpox infection, which clinicians should be aware of and consider as differential diagnoses in patients with these atypical presentations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
