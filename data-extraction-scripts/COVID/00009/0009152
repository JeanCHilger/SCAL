<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete Genome Sequence of Human Coronavirus NL63 CN0601/14, First Isolated in South Korea</TITLE><BODY>We report here the complete genome sequence of the human coronavirus NL63 CN0601/14 strain, first isolated from South Korea. It contains 18-nucleotide discontinuous deletions of the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and spike regions. This study will aid in our understanding of the complete genome sequences of isolated coronaviruses in South Korea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
