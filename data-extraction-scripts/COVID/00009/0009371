<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-03-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Clinical Features of Human Metapneumovirus Infection in Ambulatory Children Aged 5–13 Years</TITLE><BODY>We detected human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 54 (5%) of 1055 children aged 5 to 13 years with acute respiratory illness (ARI) identified by outpatient and emergency department surveillance between November and May 2003–2009. Its clinical features were similar to those of HMPV-negative ARI, except a diagnosis of pneumonia was more likely (13% vs 4%, respectively; P = .005) and a diagnosis of pharyngitis (7% vs 24%, respectively; P = .005) was less likely in patients with HMPV- positive ARI than those with HMPV-negative ARI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
