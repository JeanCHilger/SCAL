<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-05-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Correlation between Pneumonia Severity and Pulmonary Complications in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome</TITLE><BODY>This nationwide, prospective cohort study evaluated pulmonary function and radiological sequelae according to infection severity in 73 survivors from the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. Patients with severe pneumonia in MERS-coronavirus infection had more impaired pulmonary function than those with no or mild pneumonia at the 1-year follow-up, which was compatible with the radiological sequelae. Severe pneumonia significantly impairs pulmonary function and makes long radiological sequelae in MERS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
