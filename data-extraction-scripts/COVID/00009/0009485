In this study, we detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) autoantibodies using peptide array and screen the epitopes which are recognized by EGFR autoantibodies. METHODS: Peptide array covering the extracellular domain of EGFR protein was synthesized by a synthesizer (ASPSL) made by Intavis company. EGFR autoantibodies in the serums of non-small cell lung cancer patients was detected using peptide array. RESULTS: Six of 20 patients were found to have EGFR autoantibodis. The positive rate is 30%. Nine high frequency spots were found in the 6 positive patients and 8 high frequency spots clustered in the Ⅲ and Ⅳ domains. CONCLUSION: These findings will offer new clues for the futher studies of EGFR and EGFR autoantibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
