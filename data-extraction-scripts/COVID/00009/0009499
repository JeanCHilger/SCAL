<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-05-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Performance of TEM-PCR vs Culture for Bacterial Identification in Pediatric Musculoskeletal Infections</TITLE><BODY>Improved diagnostics are needed for children with musculoskeletal infections (MSKIs). We assessed the performance of target-enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (TEM-PCR) in children with MSKI. TEM-PCR was concordant with culture in pathogen identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing, while increasing the overall yield of pathogen detection. This technology has the potential to inform judicious antimicrobial use early in the disease course.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
