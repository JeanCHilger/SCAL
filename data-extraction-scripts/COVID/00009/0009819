<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-08-30</DATELINE><TITLE>A Versatile Sample Processing Workflow for Metagenomic Pathogen Detection</TITLE><BODY>Metagenomics is currently the only generic method for pathogen detection. Starting from RNA allows the assessment of the whole sample community including RNA viruses. Here we present our modular concerted protocol for sample processing for diagnostic metagenomics analysis of human, animal, and food samples. The workflow does not rely on dedicated amplification steps at any stage in the process and, in contrast to published methods, libraries prepared accordingly will yield only minute amounts of unclassifiable reads. We confirmed the performance of the approach using a spectrum of pathogen/matrix-combinations showing it has the potential to become a commonly usable analytical framework.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
