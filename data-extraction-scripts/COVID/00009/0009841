<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-04-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Crystal Dehydration in Membrane Protein Crystallography</TITLE><BODY>Crystal dehydration has been successfully implemented to facilitate the structural solution of a number of soluble and membrane protein structures over the years. This chapter will present the currently available tools to undertake controlled crystal dehydration, focusing on some successful membrane protein cases. Also discussed here will be some practical considerations regarding membrane protein crystals and the relationship between different techniques in order to help researchers to select the most suitable technique for their projects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
