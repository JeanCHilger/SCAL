<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-09-07</DATELINE><TITLE>An original design of remote robot-assisted intubation system</TITLE><BODY>The success rate of pre-hospital endotracheal intubation (ETI) by paramedics is lower than physicians. We aimed to establish a remote robot-assisted intubation system (RRAIS) and expected it to improve success rate of pre-hospital ETI. To test the robotâ€™s feasibility, 20 pigs were intubated by direct laryngoscope or the robot system. Intubation time, success rate, airway complications were recorded during the experiment. The animal experiment showed that participants achieved a higher success rate in absolute numbers by the robot system. In summary, we have successfully developed a remote robot-assisted intubation system. It is promising for RRAIS to improve the success rate of pre-hospital ETI and change the current rescue model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
