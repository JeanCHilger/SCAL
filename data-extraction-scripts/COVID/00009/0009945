Sterilization using a chemical reactor with plasma assisted catalytic technology (PACT) was investigated. Tests were carried out on the feline calicivirus (FCV) vaccine strain F9, which is a surrogate of airborne pathogen human norovirus. Results showed that the PACT device could inactivate FCV, which passed through the plasma chamber. Sterilization rate may be more than 99.99% (below the detection limit). These results indicate that PACT may be an effective mean to inactivate many viruses, including human norovirus, and potentially other airborne, infectious microorganisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
