However, the role of sensory neurons in pulmonary host defense is unclear. Here, we found that TRPV1(+) nociceptors suppressed protective immunity against lethal Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Targeted TRPV1(+)-neuron ablation increased survival, cytokine induction, and lung bacterial clearance. Nociceptors suppressed the recruitment and surveillance of neutrophils, and altered lung ᵞδ T cell numbers, which are necessary for immunity. Vagal ganglia TRPV1(+) afferents mediated immunosuppression through release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP). Targeting neuroimmunological signaling may be an effective approach to treat lung infections and bacterial pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
