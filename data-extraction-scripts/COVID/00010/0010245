Their structures were established by chemical tests and detailed spectroscopic analysis as 25-O-acetyl-7,8-didehydrocimigenol-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside (1), 7,8-didehydrocimigenol-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside (2) and 7,8-didehydro-24S-O-acetylhydroshengmanol-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside (3), respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
