Piglets were inoculated orally with S-INDEL, PC21A or mock. At 20â€“29 days post-inoculation (dpi), all pigs were challenged with the PC21A strain. The S-INDEL-inoculated pigs had lower ileal IgA antibody secreting cells, serum IgA and neutralizing antibody titers compared with PC21A-inoculated pigs. No pigs in the PC21A-group developed diarrhea, whereas 81 and 100% of pigs in the S-INDEL and mock-groups had diarrhea post challenge, respectively. S-INDEL induced partial protective immunity against the original US PEDV strain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
