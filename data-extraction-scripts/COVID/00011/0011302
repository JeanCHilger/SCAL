<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-04-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Successful Treatment of Legionnaires’ Disease with Tigecycline in an Immunocompromised Man with a Legion of Antibiotic Allergies</TITLE><BODY>Legionella species are Gram-negative bacilli that are relatively rare causes of community-acquired pneumonia but can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality if unrecognized or improperly treated. Limited data exist regarding the use of tigecycline, a third generation glycylcycline, in the treatment of Legionnaires' disease. We present an immunocompromised patient with Legionnaires' disease and allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides, which are first-line treatment options for Legionnaires' disease. He was successfully treated using tigecycline, a third generation glycylcycline, indicating that tigecycline may serve as a safe and effective alternative therapeuticl option for treatment of Legionnaires’ disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
