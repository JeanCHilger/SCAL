Many viruses have been identified as triggering the autoimmune process, including HIV, MCV, EBV, parvovirus, rubella and measles. However, ITP in association with coronavirus infection has not previously been reported. We describe the case of a healthy man who presented with severe ITP complicated by intracranial haemorrhage following upper respiratory tract infection. An infection screen revealed coronavirus infection. LEARNING POINTS: Coronavirus can cause severe immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Intracerebral haemorrhage is an uncommon presentation of ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids are very effective treatments for severe ITP.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
