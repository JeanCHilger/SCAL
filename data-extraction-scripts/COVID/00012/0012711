<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Microarray Chip Based Identification of a Mixed Infection of Bovine Herpesvirus 1 and Bovine Viral Diarrhea 2 From Indian Cattle</TITLE><BODY>Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 (BVD2) are endemic in India although no mixed infection with these viruses has been reported from India. We report first mixed infection of these viruses in cattle during routine screening with a microarray chip. 62 of the 69 probes of BHV1 and 42 of the 57 BVD2 probes in the chip gave positive signals for the virus. The virus infections were subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR. We also discuss the implications of these findings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
