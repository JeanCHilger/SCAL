The proteins show a similar effect on the lipid bilayer structural parameters: an increase in the lipid bilayer hydrophobic core, a decrease in the amplitude of the vertical density profile and a systematic change in the ordering of the acyl chains as a function of protein-to-lipid ratio. These results are discussed in a comparative view.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
