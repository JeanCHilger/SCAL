Four weeks after heat treatment, we observed, in addition to normally remyelinated axons, a few aberrantly remyelinated axons which had both CNS-and PNS-type myelin sheaths: the CNS-type myelin sheaths were always situated inside the PNS-type sheaths. This finding indicates that in some conditions Schwann cells can form myelin sheaths around those formed by oligodendrocytes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
