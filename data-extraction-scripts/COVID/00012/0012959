Viral-nucleic acid is considered to be one of actual components for interferon induction. In addition, viral glycoproteins trigger interferon induction in lymphoid cells by membrane-membrane interaction via a lectin-like activity. A biological significance of lectin-like activity of viral glycoproteins is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
