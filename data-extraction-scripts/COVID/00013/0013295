In this study, the complete genome sequence of TSHSV was determined by RACE cloning, and the functions of the predicted proteins were predicted. The complete genome of TSHSV was found to be 17,875 bp in length, and a 3â€™-end poly(A) tail was detected. Eight TSHSV hypothetical proteins (TSHSV-HPs) were predicted by gene model identification. TSHSV-HP2, 3 and 4 were associated with replicase activity, since papain-like protease (PLPs), serine-type endopeptidase, P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, and EndoU-like endoribonuclease motifs were detected. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TSHSV clusters with an arterivirus from a Chinese broad-headed pond turtle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
