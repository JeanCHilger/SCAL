<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-07-11</DATELINE><TITLE>New porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus variant with a large deletion in the spike gene identified in domestic pigs</TITLE><BODY>From October 2013 to date, approximately 1,000 outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) have occurred in Japan. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea with non-lethal effects in piglets was identified in Tottori prefecture in October 2014. Complete genome analysis revealed that the causative pathogen, Tottori2, is a new PEDV variant with a large (582 nt) deletion in the spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Tottori2 PEDV strain might have been derived from the current PEDV strains circulating in domestic pigs. Moreover, the Tottori2 PEDV strain was successfully isolated in Vero cells by serial passage.
