<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1981</DATELINE><TITLE>An immunoelectron microscopic and immunofluorescent study on the antigenic relationship between the coronavirus-like agent, CV 777, and several coronaviruses</TITLE><BODY>A possible antigenic relationship between the porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus-like agent (CVLA) and 6 known coronaviruses was examined by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and by immunofluorescence (IF). CVLA did not show cross reactivity with infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine coronavirus (CCV) hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus (NCDCV) or feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Antigenic relationship was detected by IEM between TGEV and CCV, NCDCV and HEV and by IF between TGEV and CCV, TGEV and FIPV, HEV and NCDCV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
