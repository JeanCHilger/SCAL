<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1993</DATELINE><TITLE>Feline CD 4 molecules expressed on feline non-lymphoid cell lines are not enough for productive infection of highly lymphotropic feline immunodeficiency virus isolates</TITLE><BODY>To investigate whether the feline CD 4 (fCD 4) molecules are involved in infections of highly lymphotropic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) isolates, we expressed fCD 4 stably on Crandell feline kidney cells andFelis catus whole foetus 4 cells by transfection of a cDNA encoding the fCD 4 glycoprotein, and then infected them with TM 1 and TM 2 strains of FIV, which are unable to infect these cells productively. In spite of fCD 4 being expressed on these cells, no virus production was observed. This result indicates that fCD 4 expression alone cannot induce a productive infection of the FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
