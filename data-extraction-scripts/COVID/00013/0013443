This article briefly reviews the role of mathematical models and‚ê£their historical precedents for creating new knowledge of the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, transmission, and control of some human viral infections. Future research in the modelling of infectious diseases will need to rely upon incorporation of the fundamental principles that govern viral dynamics in vivo as well as in the population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
