<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004</DATELINE><TITLE>Structural Organization of the Genome of SARS-Associated Coronavirus (Strain SoD) Isolated on the Territory of the Russian Federation</TITLE><BODY>Complete nucleotide cDNA sequence (29715 nucleotides) of SARS-associated coronavirus (strain SoD) isolated for the first time in the territory of the Russian Federation was determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed maximum similarity between strain SoD genome and Frankfurt 1 strain genome. Three nucleotide substitutions determining two amino acid substitutions were detected.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
