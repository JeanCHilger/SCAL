<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-12-09</DATELINE><TITLE>A complexity-based measure and its application to phylogenetic analysis</TITLE><BODY>In this article, we propose two well-defined distance metrics of biological sequences based on a universal complexity profile. To illustrate our metrics, phylogenetic trees of 18 Eutherian mammals from comparison of their mtDNA sequences and 24 coronaviruses using the whole genomes are constructed. The resulting monophyletic clusters agree well with the established taxonomic groups.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
