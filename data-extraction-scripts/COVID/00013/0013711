Among IFNs, IFN alpha (IFNA) has the largest number of family members and plays an important role against the invasion of pathogens. Bats are putative and proven vectors for numerous viruses; however, the evolution of the IFNA family in bats has not been addressed. Here, we construct a phylogeny of IFNA families, including one fruit bat (Dobsonia viridis), with other vertebrates as references. Site-model estimation reveals that positive selection has shaped bat IFNA genes, showing that positive selection drives the evolution of bat IFNA genes.
