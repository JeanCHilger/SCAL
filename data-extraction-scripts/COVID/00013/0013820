Herein, to elucidate the mechanism through TCDD modifies BoHV-1 infection, we analyzed the modulation of a members of Sirtuin proteins family in MDBK cells. We found that mitochondrial SIRT3 was upregulated during infection. This change was accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell extensions. All these trends were drastically modified by TCDD. We hypothesize that, taken together, these results might further clarify the processes responsible for the action of TCDD on the BoHV-1 replication, resulting in enhanced virus production.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
