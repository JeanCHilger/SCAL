<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Identification of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus variant with a large spike gene deletion from a clinical swine sample in the United States</TITLE><BODY>Two genetically different porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains have been identified in the USA: US prototype (also called non-S INDEL) and S INDEL PEDVs. In February 2017, a PEDV variant (USA/OK10240-8/2017) was identified in a rectal swab from a sow farm in Oklahoma, USA. Complete genome sequence analyses indicated this PEDV variant was genetically similar to US non-S INDEL strain but had a continuous 600-nt (200-aa) deletion in the N-terminal domain of the spike gene compared to non-S INDEL PEDVs. This is the first report of detecting PEDV bearing large spike gene deletion in clinical swine samples in the USA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
