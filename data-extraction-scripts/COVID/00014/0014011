<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003</DATELINE><TITLE>Oral Immunization using Tuber Extracts from Transgenic Potato Plants Expressing Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Capsid Protein</TITLE><BODY>Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, which is caused by a calicivirus, is a lethal infection of adult animals that is characterized by acute liver damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this study, we report the production of the major structural protein VP60 of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus in transgenic tubers of potato plants and its use as an oral immunogen in rabbits.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
