<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-03-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Infections of the Lower Respiratory Tract</TITLE><BODY>Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a global burden to public health and are frequently caused by respiratory viruses. Advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have allowed the identification of previously undetected viral pathogens and have improved our understanding of respiratory virus infections. Here we review the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of recently identified viruses including human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, human rhinovirus C, bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses, and parechovirus. The roles of these viruses in LRTIs in children and adults are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
