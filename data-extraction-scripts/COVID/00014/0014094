Recent studies have shown that under pathologic conditions, ACE2 expression in the kidney is altered. In this review, we briefly summarize recent studies dealing with pharmacologic interventions that modulate ACE2 expression. ACE2 amplification may have a potential therapeutic role for kidney disease and hypertension.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
