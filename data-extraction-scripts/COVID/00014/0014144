<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1995</DATELINE><TITLE>Precise large deletions by the PCR-based overlap extension method</TITLE><BODY>The authors describe an efficient method for generating large deletions (>200 nts) of precise length using the PCR-based method of gene splicing by overlap extension (1). This method is technically simple and less time consuming than conventional loop-out mutagenesis techniques requiring preparation of a single-stranded DNA template.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
