<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-09-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Illuminating the Gateway of Gene Silencing: Perspective of RNA Interference Technology in Clinical Therapeutics</TITLE><BODY>A novel laboratory revolution for disease therapy, the RNA interference (RNAi) technology, has adopted a new era of molecular research as the next generation “Gene-targeted prophylaxis.” In this review, we have focused on the chief technological challenges associated with the efforts to develop RNAi-based therapeutics that may guide the biomedical researchers. Many non-curable maladies, like neurodegenerative diseases and cancers have effectively been cured using this technology. Rapid advances are still in progress for the development of RNAi-based technologies that will be having a major impact on medical research. We have highlighted the recent discoveries associated with the phenomenon of RNAi, expression of silencing molecules in mammals along with the vector systems used for disease therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
