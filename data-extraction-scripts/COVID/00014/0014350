<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004</DATELINE><TITLE>Virus PCR Assay Panels: An Alternative to the Mouse Antibody Production Test</TITLE><BODY>Antibody production tests have traditionally been used to test biological materials for viral contamination. Now molecular biology techniques have emerged as an alternative. The authors compare MAP testing with PCR-based detection methods, focusing on differences in animal use, laboratory requirements, sample size, and limits of detection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
