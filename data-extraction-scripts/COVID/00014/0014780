<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Pathogenic epitopes, heterologous immunity and vaccine design</TITLE><BODY>Substantial research has been directed towards the development of a new generation of vaccines that are based on the inclusion of immunogenic epitopes in recombinant vectors. Here we examine the evidence that under certain conditions immunogenic epitopes can do more harm than good and might therefore be considered pathogenic. We suggest that the specific removal of such pathogenic epitopes from vaccines might increase their prophylactic potential, while minimizing the risk of side-effects from vaccine use.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
