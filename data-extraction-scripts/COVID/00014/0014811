<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2001</DATELINE><TITLE>Metalloproteinases in biology and pathology of the nervous system</TITLE><BODY>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in several diseases of the nervous system. Here we review the evidence that supports this idea and discuss the possible mechanisms of MMP action. We then consider some of the beneficial functions of MMPs during neural development and speculate on their roles in repair after brain injury. We also introduce a family of proteins known as ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase), as some of the properties previously ascribed to MMPs are possibly the result of ADAM activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
