<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004</DATELINE><TITLE>Transmission cycles, host range, evolution and emergence of arboviral disease</TITLE><BODY>Many pandemics have been attributed to the ability of some RNA viruses to change their host range to include humans. Here, we review the mechanisms of disease emergence that are related to the host-range specificity of selected mosquito-borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses. We discuss viruses of medical importance, including Venezuelan equine and Japanese encephalitis viruses, dengue viruses and West Nile viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
