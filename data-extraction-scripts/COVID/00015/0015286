Here, H5N1 nucleoprotein and hemagglutinin were identified by immunohistochemistry in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neutrophils in the placental blood of a pregnant woman. Viral RNA was detected in neutrophils by in situ hybridization and enhanced real-time polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, neutrophils may serve as a vehicle for viral replication and transportation in avian influenza.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
