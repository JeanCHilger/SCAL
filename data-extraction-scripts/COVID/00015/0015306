<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular Diagnostics for Detection of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens in Community-Acquired Pneumonia</TITLE><BODY>Traditional microbiological methods for detection of respiratory tract pathogens can be slow, are often not sensitive, may not distinguish infection from colonization, and are influenced by previous antibiotic therapy. Molecular diagnostic tests for common and atypical causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia have the potential to dramatically increase the diagnostic yield and decrease the time required to render results. Unfortunately, these tests often lack standardization and are not widely available. Consideration should be given to the development and evaluation of companion molecular diagnostic tests for detection of respiratory pathogens in future clinical trials of antimicrobials intended to treat community-acquired pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
