Nowadays sequencing-based methods, especially whole genome sequencing, are becoming increasingly important. Implementation of such methods into routine diagnostic of highly dangerous pathogens, like Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Ebola virus, MERS, Lassa virus etc. would be very helpful. The best diagnostic strategy would be the metagenomic sequencing directly from the clinical sample. Implementation of majority of currently available WGS platforms inside the BSL-3 or 4 laboratory is impractical because of the size of the equipment and time consuming wet lab part (e.g. library preparation). Nowadays there is a possibility to implement pocket size MinION - real time whole genome sequencer into BSL-3 and 4 laboratory for rapid and precise diagnostic purposes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
