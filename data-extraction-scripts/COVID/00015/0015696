Fifty-three patients with KD were enrolled in our study. Serum, peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat swabs, and rectal swabs from these patients were assayed for HCoV-NL63 by real-time reverse-transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and rectal swabs were also assayed for HCoV-NH by RT-PCR. All PCR results were negative for both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-NH; therefore, we did not find any association between HCoV-NH infection and KD in Taiwan&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
