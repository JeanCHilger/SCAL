Concern that a novel pathogen might be implicated led us to implement a new multiplex diagnostic tool. MassTag polymerase chain reaction resolved 26 of 79 previously negative samples, revealing the presence of rhinoviruses in a large proportion of samples, half of which belonged to a previously uncharacterized genetic clade. In some instances, knowledge of the detected viral and/or bacterial (co)infection could have altered clinical management&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
