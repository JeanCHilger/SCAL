<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-06-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Phage Display: A Powerful Technology for the Generation of High Specificity Affinity Reagents from Alternative Immune Sources</TITLE><BODY>Antibodies are critical reagents in many fundamental biochemical methods such as affinity chromatography. As our understanding of the proteome becomes more complex, demand is rising for rapidly generated antibodies of higher specificity than ever before. It is therefore surprising that few investigators have moved beyond the classical methods of antibody production in their search for new reagents. Despite their long-standing efficacy, recombinant antibody generation technologies such as phage display are still largely the tools of biotechnology companies or research groups with a direct interest in protein engineering. In this chapter, we discuss the inherent limitations of classical polyclonal and monoclonal antibody generation and highlight an attractive alternative: generating high specificity, high affinity recombinant antibodies from alternative immune sources such as chickens, via phage display.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
