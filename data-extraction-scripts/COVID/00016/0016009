Using the same expression system, two structural proteins, membrane (M) and envelope (E), were co-expressed to form SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) within an insect cell. Expression of viral proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis and the formation of VLPs was studied by transmission electron microscopy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
