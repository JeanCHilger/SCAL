Nevertheless, management of HIV-1 infected individuals has become increasingly complex. The emergence of drug-resistant variants, the growing recognition of the long-term toxicity of antiretroviral therapies and the persistence of viral reservoirs justify the continued efforts to develop new anti-HIV-1 strategies. Recent advances regarding the utility of RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to specifically inhibit HIV-1 replication have opened new possibilities for the development of gene-based therapies against HIV-1 infection. Here, the recent advances in siRNA-based therapies are reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
