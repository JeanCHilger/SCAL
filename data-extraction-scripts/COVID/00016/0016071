<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-01-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Impact of MicroRNA in Normal and Pathological Respiratory Epithelia</TITLE><BODY>Extensive sequencing efforts, combined with ad hoc bioinformatics developments, have now led to the identification of 1222 distinct miRNAs in human (derived from 1368 distinct genomic loci) and of many miRNAs in other multicellular organisms. The present chapter is aimed at describing a general experimental strategy to identify specific miRNA expression profiles and to highlight the functional networks operating between them and their mRNA targets, including several miRNAs deregulated in cystic fibrosis and during differentiation of airway epithelial cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
