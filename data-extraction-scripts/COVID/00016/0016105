However, expression of cDNAs coding for viral proteins in prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems is often not straightforward, and frequently the amount and/or the solubility of the protein obtained are not sufficient. Here, we describe a number of protocols for production of nonstructural proteins of coronaviruses that have proven to be efficient in increasing expression yields or solubilities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
