<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-08-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular Approaches to Recognize Relevant and Emerging Infectious Diseases in Animals</TITLE><BODY>Since the introduction of the first molecular tests, there has been a continuous effort to develop new and improved assays for rapid and efficient detection of infectious agents. This has been motivated by a need for improved sensitivity as well as results that can be easily communicated. The experiences and knowledge gained at the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Collaborating Centre for Biotechnology-based Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases in Veterinary Medicine, Uppsala, Sweden, will here be used to provide an overview of the different molecular approaches that can be used to diagnose and identify relevant and emerging infectious diseases in animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
