<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-12-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Macrophage Pattern Recognition Receptors in Immunity, Homeostasis and Self Tolerance</TITLE><BODY>Macrophages, a major component of innate immune defence, express a large repertoire of different classes of pattern recognition receptors and other surface antigens which determine the immunologic and homeostatic potential of these versatile cells. In the light of present knowledge of macrophage surface antigens, we discuss self versus nonself recognition, microbicidal effector functions and self tolerance in the innate immune system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
