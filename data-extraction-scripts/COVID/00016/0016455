<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Biocrystallography: past, present, future</TITLE><BODY>The evolution of biocrystallography from the pioneers’ time to the present era of global biology is presented in relation to the development of methodological and instrumental advances for molecular sample preparation and structure elucidation over the last 6 decades. The interdisciplinarity of the field that generated cross-fertilization between physics- and biology-focused themes is emphasized. In particular, strategies to circumvent the main bottlenecks of biocrystallography are discussed. They concern (i) the way macromolecular targets are selected, designed, and characterized, (ii) crystallogenesis and how to deal with physical and biological parameters that impact crystallization for growing and optimizing crystals, and (iii) the methods for crystal analysis and 3D structure determination. Milestones that have marked the history of biocrystallography illustrate the discussion. Finally, the future of the field is envisaged. Wide gaps of the structural space need to be filed and membrane proteins as well as intrinsically unstructured proteins still constitute challenging targets. Solving supramolecular assemblies of increasing complexity, developing a “4D biology” for decrypting the kinematic changes in macromolecular structures in action, integrating these structural data in the whole cell organization, and deciphering biomedical implications will represent the new frontiers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
