In the present study, we investigated the intracellular pharmacology of tritiated l-Hyd4C in HepG2 cells. l-[(3)H]Hyd4C was shown to be phosphorylated extensively and rapidly to the 5′-mono-, 5′-di-, and 5′-triphosphate derivatives. Other metabolites deriving from a reduction or removal of the NHOH group of l-Hyd4C could not be detected, although both reactions were described as the primary catabolic pathways of the stereoisomer ß-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine in HepG2 cells. Also, the formation of liponucleotide metabolites, such as the 5′-diphosphocholine derivative of l-Hyd4C, as described for some l-deoxycytidine analogues, seems to be unlikely. After incubation of HepG2 cells with 10 μM l-[(3)H]Hyd4C for 24 h, the 5′-triphosphate accumulated to 19.4 ± 2.7 pmol/10(6) cells. The predominant peak belonged to 5-diphosphate, with 43.5 ± 4.3 pmol/10(6) cells. The intracellular half-life of the 5′-triphosphate was estimated to be 29.7 h. This extended half-life probably reflects a generally low affinity of 5′-phosphorylated l-deoxycytidine derivatives for phosphate-degrading enzymes but may additionally be caused by an efficient rephosphorylation of the 5′-diphosphate during a drug-free incubation. The high 5′-triphosphate level and its extended half-life in HepG2 cells are consistent with the potent antiviral activity of l-Hyd4C.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
