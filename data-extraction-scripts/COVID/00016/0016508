Many aspects of WHV replication and pathogenesis resemble acute and chronic hepatitis B infection in patients. Since the establishment of immunological tools, woodchucks were used to develop new therapeutic vaccines and immunomodulatory approaches to treat chronic hepadnaviral infections. Combination therapy of nucleos(t)ide analogs, with primeâ€“boost vaccination and triple therapy, including immunomodulatory strategies by blocking the interaction of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor with its ligand inducing a potent T-cell response in chronic WHV carrier woodchucks, suppression of viral replication, and complete elimination of the virus in 30% of the animals. Both strategies may be used for future therapies in patients with chronic hepatitis B.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
