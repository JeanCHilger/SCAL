However, no T. gondii specific HLA-B07 restricted peptides were proven protective against T gondii. Recently, two T gondii-specific HLA-B*0702-restricted T cell epitopes, GRA7(20–28) (LPQFATAAT) and GRA3(27–35) (VPFVVFLVA), displayed high-affinity binding to HLA-B*0702, and elicited IFN-γ from PBMCs of seropositive HLA-B*0702 persons. Herein, these peptides were evaluated to determine whether they could elicit IFN-γ in splenocytes of HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice when administered with adjuvants and protect against subsequent challenge. Peptide-specific IFN-γ producing T cells were identified by ELISPOT and proliferation assays utilizing splenic T lymphocytes from HLA transgenic mice. When HLA-B*0702 mice were immunized with one of the epitopes identified, GRA7(20–28) in conjunction with a universal CD4(+) T cell epitope (PADRE) and adjuvants (CD4(+) T cell adjuvant, GLA-SE, and TLR2 stimulatory Pam(2)Cys for CD8(+) T cells), this immunization induced CD8(+) T cells to produce IFN-γ and protected mice against high parasite burden when challenged with T gondii. This work demonstrates feasibility of bioinformatics followed by an empirical approach based on HLA binding to test this biological activity for identifying protective HLA-B*0702 restricted T gondii peptides and adjuvants that elicit protective immune responses in HLA-B*0702 mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
