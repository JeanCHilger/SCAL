Because IL-17A and IL-17F, ligands for IL-17 receptor antagonist (IL-17RA), have been shown to mediate neutrophil migration into the lung in response to LPS or Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia, we hypothesized that IL-17RA signaling was critical for acute lung injury in response to pulmonary influenza infection. IL-17RA was critical for weight loss and both neutrophil migration and increases in tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) after influenza infection. However, IL-17RA was dispensable for the recruitment of CD8(+) T cells specific for influenza hemagglutinin or nucleocapsid protein. Consistent with this, IL-17RA was not required for viral clearance. However, in the setting of influenza infection, IL-17RA(−/−) mice showed significantly reduced levels of oxidized phospholipids, which have previously been shown to be an important mediator in several models of acute lung injury, including influenza infection and gastric acid aspiration. Taken together, these data support targeting IL-17 or IL-17RA in acute lung injury due to acute viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
