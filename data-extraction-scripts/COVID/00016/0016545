The aim of this study was to elucidate the extent to which the Intercept treatment modifies the functional properties of platelets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A two-arm study was conducted initially to compare buffy coat-derived pathogen-inactivated PC to untreated PC (n=5) throughout storage. A four-arm study was then designed to evaluate the contribution of the compound adsorbing device (CAD) and ultraviolet (UV) illumination to the changes observed upon Intercept treatment. Intercept-treated PC, CAD-incubated PC, and UV-illuminated PC were compared to untreated PC (n=5). Functional characteristics were assessed using flow cytometry, hypotonic shock response (HSR), aggregation, adhesion assays and flow cytometry for the detection of CD62P, CD42b, GPIIb-IIIa, phosphatidylserine exposure and JC-1 aggregates. RESULTS: Compared to fresh platelets, end-of-storage platelets exhibited greater passive activation, disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψ(m)), and phosphatidylserine exposure accompanied by a decreased capacity to respond to agonist-induced aggregation, lower HSR, and CD42b expression. The Intercept treatment resulted in significantly lower HSR and CD42b expression compared to controls on day 7, with no significant changes in CD62P, Δψ(m), or phosphatidylserine exposure. GPIIbIIIa expression was significantly increased in Intercept-treated platelets throughout the storage period. The agonist-induced aggregation response was highly dependent on the type and concentration of agonist used, indicating a minor effect of the Intercept treatment. The CAD and UV steps alone had a negligible effect on platelet aggregation. DISCUSSION: The Intercept treatment moderately affects platelet function in vitro. CAD and UV illumination alone make negligible contributions to the changes in aggregation observed in Intercept-treated PC.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
