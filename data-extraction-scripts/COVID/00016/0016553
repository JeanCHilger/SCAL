Colostrum-derived antibodies make the detection of persistently BVDV-infected neonatal calves cumbersome and expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples from neonatal calves as a method for the early detection of persistent BVDV infection. Three hundred thirty-two 1- to 4-week-old dairy calves were screened for BVDV as part of a routine control program. Formalin-fixed skin biopsy samples were stained for BVDV antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the results were compared to those of virus isolation (VI) from white blood cell preparations. Six calves were positive by both IHC and VI and remained positive for BVDV upon subsequent follow-up testing; thus, they were classified as persistently infected with BVDV. One calf was positive by VI but negative by IHC. On subsequent testing, the calf was negative by VI, suggesting that the initial VI result was due to an acute BVDV infection. One calf was positive by IHC but negative by VI. This calf remained negative by VI on follow-up testing. Immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples is a reliable method for screening neonatal calves for persistent BVDV infection and would be a useful management tool as an aid for controlling and preventing BVDV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
