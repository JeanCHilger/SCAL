<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-03-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Heritable Thrombophilia-Hypofibrinolysis and Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head</TITLE><BODY>We hypothesized that inherited thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis were risk factors for osteonecrosis of the femoral head. We compared measures of thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis in referred new adult patients with idiopathic osteonecrosis (n = 71) or secondary osteonecrosis (n = 62) with the same measures in sex- and race-matched healthy control subjects. Heritable thrombophilic Factor VIII and hypofibrinolytic Lp(a) were more frequently high in the 71 patients with idiopathic osteonecrosis than in control subjects. High Factor VIII, Factor V Leiden heterozygosity, and resistance to activated protein C, all heritable thrombophilias, were more frequently present in the 62 patients with secondary osteonecrosis than in control subjects. Our data suggest inherited thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis are risk factors for both idiopathic and secondary osteonecrosis of the head of the femur. Level of Evidence: Level IV, prognostic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
