We sought to determine whether HRV are a cause of wheezing and/or hospitalization in children < 2 years old. METHODS: A PCR assay was used to screen for HRV infection in 4 categories of children < 2 years old: 1) with symptoms of respiratory tract disease without wheezing; 2) with wheezing with or without other symptoms; 3) who were asymptomatic and; 4) who had a respiratory specimen submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. All specimens were collected between January and December, 2004. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on most HRV isolates. RESULTS: Twenty-eight (17%) of 165 children with symptoms of respiratory infection without wheezing; 21 (26.3%) of 80 children with wheezing; 3 (3%) of 93 asymptomatic children and 47 (23.3%) of 202 children with specimens submitted to the diagnostic laboratory tested positive for HRV. The difference between the rates of infection in the asymptomatic group and in each of the three other categories was statistically significant (pâ‰¤0.01). Among HRV-positive children with samples submitted to the diagnostic laboratory, 55% were hospitalized which was similar to that observed for respiratory syncytial virus (52.7%) among children of a similar age group and time period (P=0.85). Diverse groups of HRV were circulating during the one-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: HRV are important pathogens among children < 2 years old and are responsible for a significant proportion of wheezing this age group. The hospitalization rates of HRV-positive children appear to be similar to that of RSV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
