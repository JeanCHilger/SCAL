<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-01-14</DATELINE><TITLE>A Simple Red Blood Cell Lysis Method for the Establishment of B Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines</TITLE><BODY>A number of methods exist for the transformation of B lymphocytes by the Epstein Barr virus in vitro into immortalized cell lines. We have developed a new method with a powerful and simple strategy for the establishment of B-LCLs, the red blood cell lysis method. This method simplified the PBMC separation procedure with red blood cell removal, and used as little as 0.5 mL of whole blood for establishing EBV-immortalized cell lines, which can proliferate to large cell numbers in a relatively short amount time with a 100% success rate. The method is simple, reliable, time saving, and applicable to treating a large number of the clinical samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
