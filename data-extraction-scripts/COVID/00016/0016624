<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Absence of Gastrointestinal Pathogens in Ileum Tissue Resected for Necrotizing Enterocolitis</TITLE><BODY>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in premature infants and has been linked with viral antigens for as much as 40% of cases in single center cohorts. We examined 28 tissue sections from surgically resected ileum from 27 preterm infants with NEC from 2 separate institutions for 15 common bacterial, viral, and parasitic gastrointestinal pathogens using multiplex RT-PCR amplification and suspension array detection methods. We did not detect infectious enteritis pathogens in any of the NEC tissues and conclude that gastrointestinal pathogens are a rare cause of NEC.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
