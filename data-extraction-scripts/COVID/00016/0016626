To identify host proteins that bind to viral RNAs, we took a global approach based on the yeast proteome microarray, which contains 4080 purified yeast proteins. The biotin-labeled RNA probes included two distantly related RNA viruses, namely Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and Brome mosaic virus (BMV). Altogether, we have identified 57 yeast proteins that bound to TBSV RNA and/or BMV RNA. Among the identified host proteins, eleven bound to TBSV RNA and seven bound to BMV RNA with high selectivity, whereas the remaining 39 host proteins bound to both viral RNAs. The interaction between the TBSV replicon RNA and five of the identified host proteins were confirmed via gel-mobility shift and co-purification experiments from yeast. Over-expression of the host proteins in yeast, a model host for TBSV, revealed that 4 host proteins that enhanced TBSV replication as well as 14 proteins that inhibited replication. Detailed analysis of one of the identified yeast proteins binding to TBSV RNA, namely translation elongation factor eEF1A, revealed that it is present in the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex. We also demonstrate binding of eEF1A to the p33 replication protein and a known cis-acting element at the 3â€² end of TBSV RNA. Using a functional mutant of eEF1A, we provide evidence on the involvement of eEF1A in TBSV replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
