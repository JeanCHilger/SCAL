<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-11-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Recent advances in the development of antiviral therapeutics for Rift Valley fever virus infection</TITLE><BODY>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne bunyavirus endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and the etiological agent of Rift Valley fever. Rift Valley fever is a disease of major public health and economic concern, affecting livestock and humans. In ruminants, RVFV infection is characterized by high mortality rates in newborns and near 100% abortion rates in pregnant animals. Infection in humans is typically manifested as a self-limiting febrile illness, but can lead to severe and fatal hepatitis, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever or retinitis with partial or complete blindness. Currently, there are no specific treatment options available for RVFV infection. This review presents a summary of the therapeutic approaches that have been explored on the treatment of RVFV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
