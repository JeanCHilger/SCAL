<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-08-04</DATELINE><TITLE>Recent advances in the molecular biology of metazoan polyamine transport</TITLE><BODY>Very limited molecular knowledge exists about the identity and protein components of the ubiquitous polyamine transporters found in animal cells. However, a number of reports have been published over the last 5 years on potential candidates for metazoan polyamine permeases. We review the available evidence on these putative polyamine permeases, as well as establish a useful «identikit picture» of the general polyamine transport system, based on its properties as found in a wide spectrum of mammalian cells. Any molecular candidate encoding a putative «general» polyamine permease should fit that provided portrait. The current models proposed for the mechanism of polyamine internalization in mammalian cells are also briefly reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
