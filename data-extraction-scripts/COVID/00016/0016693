<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Porcine peripheral blood dendritic cells and natural interferon-producing cells</TITLE><BODY>Peripheral blood contains two major particular infrequent dendritic cells (DC) subsets linking the innate and specific immune system, the myeloid DC and plasmacytoid DC equivalent to the natural interferon-producing cells (NIPC). The functional characterization of these cells demands large volumes of blood, making a large animal model more appropriate and beneficial for certain studies. Here, two subsets of porcine blood mononuclear cells expressing swine workshop cluster 3 (SWC3, a SIRP family member), are described and compared to monocytes. The blood DC specialized in T-cell stimulation were major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II(+), CD80/86(+), CD1(+/–), CD4(−), and in contrast to monocytes CD14(−). A CD16(−) and a CD16(+) subset could be discriminated. Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 were survival factors for this DC subset, and culture induced an up-regulation of MHC class II and CD80/86. The second subset described, are porcine NIPC, typically CD4(++), MHC class II(low), CD80/86(low), CD1(−), CD8(−/low), CD16(−/low) and CD45RA(−/low). Porcine NIPC had high interleukin-3 binding capacity, and survived in response to this cytokine. Their unique function was strong interferon type I secretion after virus stimulation. Both subsets were endocytically active when freshly isolated, and down-regulated this activity after in vitro maturation. Taken together, the present report has delineated porcine blood DC and NIPC, permitting a more detailed understanding of innate immune defences, particularly in response to infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
