Epidemiological studies have identified influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus as the most frequent causes of virus-induced respiratory disease in elderly and high-risk adults. Studies in both humans and animal models have established fundamental defects in cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in aged individuals. However, it is not well understood how age specifically alters the immune response to respiratory pathogens. In this review, we will focus our discussion on the major causative agents of severe respiratory virus infections in elderly and high-risk adults and the age-associated defects in the immune response that probably contribute to the increased disease severity observed in these populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
