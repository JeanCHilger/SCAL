Infections of two lines of chickens previously documented as genetically resistant and sensitive to infection were compared in order to ascertain early differences in the response to infection that might provide clues to the mechanism of differential genetic resistance. In addition to major changes that could be explained by previously described changes in infected tissue, some differences in gene expression on infection, and differences between the two chicken lines, were observed that led to a model for resistance in which a more rapid inflammatory response and more-extensive p53-related induction of apoptosis in the target B cells might limit viral replication and consequent pathology. Ironically, the effect in the asymptomatic neonatal infection is that more-severe B-cell depletion is seen in the more genetically resistant chicken. Changes of expression of many chicken genes of unknown function, indicating possible roles in the response to infection, may aid in the functional annotation of these genes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
