Who-infected-whom information enabled us to back-calculate the infectiousness by disease age, employing a step function model for infectiousness. Frequency of secondary transmissions was highest between 3 and 6 days after onset of fever, yielding an expected daily frequency of 20·6% (95% CI 15·1–26·4) of the total number of secondary transmissions, which is consistent with previous observations. The estimated cumulative frequency suggests that 91·1% of secondary transmissions occurred up to 9 days after onset of fever. The proposed method appeared to be useful for diseases with an acute course of illness, where transmission was not hampered by depletion of susceptible contacts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
