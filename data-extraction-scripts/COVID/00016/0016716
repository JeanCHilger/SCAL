Type I and II IFNs bind distinct receptors and are associated with different stages of the immune response. There is however, considerable crosstalk between these two cytokines with enhancement of IFNγ responses following IFNα/β priming and loss of IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR) resulting in diminished IFNγ responses. In this study, we sought to define the mechanism of crosstalk between the type I and II IFNs. Our previous reports demonstrated reduced expression of the canonically activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, in cells lacking the IFNAR α chain (IFNAR1). Therefore, we used microarray analysis to determine whether reconstitution of STAT1 in IFNAR1-deficient cells was sufficient to restore IFNγ responses. We identified several biological pathways, including the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, in which STAT1 reconstitution was able to significantly rescue IFNγ-mediated gene regulation in Ifnar1(−/−) cells. Notably, we also found that in addition to low basal expression of STAT1, cells lacking the IFNAR1 also had aberrant expression of multiple other transcription factors and signaling intermediaries. The studies described herein demonstrate that basal and regulated expression of signaling intermediaries is a mechanism for crosstalk between cytokines including type I and II IFNs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
