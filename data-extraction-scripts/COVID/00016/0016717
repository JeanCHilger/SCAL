Brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicates its RNA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated complexes in plant cells and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. BMV encodes RNA replication factors 1a, with domains implicated in RNA capping and helicase functions, and 2a, with a central polymerase-like domain. Factor 1a interacts independently with the ER membrane, viral RNA templates, and factor 2a to form RNA replication complexes on the perinuclear ER. We show that BMV RNA replication is severely inhibited by a mutation in OLE1, an essential yeast chromosomal gene encoding Δ9 fatty acid desaturase, an integral ER membrane protein and the first enzyme in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. OLE1 deletion and medium supplementation show that BMV RNA replication requires unsaturated fatty acids, not the Ole1 protein, and that viral RNA replication is much more sensitive than yeast growth to reduced unsaturated fatty acid levels. In ole1 mutant yeast, 1a still becomes membrane associated, recruits 2a to the membrane, and recognizes and stabilizes viral RNA templates normally. However, RNA replication is blocked prior to initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis. The results show that viral RNA synthesis is highly sensitive to lipid composition and suggest that proper membrane fluidity or plasticity is essential for an early step in RNA replication. The strong unsaturated fatty acid dependence also demonstrates that modulating fatty acid balance can be an effective antiviral strategy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
