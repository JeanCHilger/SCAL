We sought to define the viral etiology of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and identify risk factors. METHODS: Nasal wash samples were collected from pediatric hematology-oncology patients and HSCT recipients with ARI during the 2003–2005 winter seasons. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to detect influenza A (Flu A), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzaviruses (PIV) 1–3, human metapneumovirus (MPV), and human rhinoviruses (HRV). HRV specimens were sequenced and genotyped. RESULTS: Seventy-eight samples from 62 children were included. Viruses were detected in 31 of 78 samples (40%). HRV were detected most frequently, in 16 (52%) including 5 HRV type C (HRVC); followed by 7 (22%) RSV, 5 (16%) Flu A, 4 (13%) MPV and 2 (6%) PIV2. There was a trend toward higher risk of viral infection for children in daycare. Only 8% of the study children had received infuenza vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: HRV, including the recently discovered HRVC, are an important cause of infection in pediatric oncology and HSCT patients. Molecular testing is superior to conventional methods and should be standard of care, since HRV are not detected by conventional methods.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
