Some processes among them are irreversible, such as helix hairpin formation of the ectodomain, whereas others are reversible, such as exposure of the fusion peptide. Using this property, we attempted to dissect, in temporal order, different stages of the fusion reaction involving the fusion peptide by an acidic–neutral–acidic pH cycle. The fluorescence-quenching data indicated that both insertion depth and self-assembly are pH-reversible. In addition, lipid mixing assay was demonstrated to be arrested by neutral pH. By contrast, membrane leakage was shown to be irreversible with respect to pH. Our results, along with those from other studies on the pH-dependence of membrane fusion, are used to build a model for the virus-mediated fusion event from the perspective of pH-reversibility.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
