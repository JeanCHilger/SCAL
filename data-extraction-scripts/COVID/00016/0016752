However, infections with unrelated pathogens, as may occur in malaria endemic areas, dramatically decrease pre-existing memory CD8 T-cells. It remains unknown whether unrelated infections will compromise numbers of Plasmodium-specific memory CD8 T-cells and thus limit the duration of anti-malarial immunity generated by subunit vaccination. We show that P. berghei circumsporozoite-specific memory CD8 T-cells underwent significant attrition in numbers in mice subjected to unrelated infections. Attrition was associated with preferential loss of effector memory CD8 T-cells and reduced immunity to P. berghei sporozoite challenge. However, and of relevance to deployment of Plasmodium vaccines in malaria endemic areas, attrition of memory CD8 T-cells was reversed by booster immunization, which restored protection. These data suggest that regular booster immunizations may be required to sustain protective vaccine-induced Plasmodium-specific memory CD8 T-cells in the face of attrition caused by unrelated infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
