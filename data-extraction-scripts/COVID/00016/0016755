In C57BL/6 mice the TG-resident CD8(+) T cells are HSV-specific and maintain a 1:1 ratio of cells recognizing an immunodominant epitope on viral glycoprotein B (gB(498–505)-Tet(+)) and cells reactive to subdominant epitopes (gB-Tet(−)). The gB-Tet(−) CD8(+) T cells maintain their frequency in TG by balancing a higher rate of proliferation with a correspondingly higher rate of apoptosis. The increased apoptosis is associated with higher expression of Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) on gB-Tet(−) CD8(+) T cells, and the interaction with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1/B7H1). IFN-γ regulated expression of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1/B7H1) on neurons bearing higher copies of latent viral genome. In latently infected TG of B7H1(−/−) mice, the number and frequency of PD-1(+) gB-Tet(−) CD8(+) T cells increases dramatically, but gB-Tet(−) CD8(+) T cells remain largely non-functional, and do not provide increased protection from HSV-1 reactivation in ex vivo cultures of latently infected TG. Unlike observations in some chronic infection models, B7H1 blockade did not increase the function of exhausted gB-Tet(−) CD8 T cells in latently infected TG.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
