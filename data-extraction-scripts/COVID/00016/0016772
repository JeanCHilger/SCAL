RESEARCH DESIGN: Persons who presented to the emergency department (ED) or were hospitalized with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms at the academic medical center within Forsyth County, NC were prospectively enrolled with nasal/throat swab testing for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus identified through active surveillance were compared by capture-recapture analysis to those identified through independent, passive surveillance (physician-ordered influenza testing). This approach estimated the total cases, including those not captured by either surveillance system. A second analysis estimated the total influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases by multiplying weekly influenza percentages from active surveillance by weekly counts of influenza-associated discharge diagnoses from administrative data. Market share adjustments were used to estimate influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1000 residents overall. RESULTS: Capture-recapture analysis estimated 753 residents (95% confidence interval, 424–2,735) were seen with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus within the academic medical center from September 2009 through mid-April 2010; this result yielded an estimated 4.7 (95% confidence interval 2.6–16.9) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1000 residents. Similarly, 708 visits were estimated using weekly influenza percentages and influenza-associated discharge diagnoses, yielding an estimated 4.4 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1000 residents. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the burden of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in ED and inpatient settings by capture-recapture analysis was 4–5 per 1000 residents and ~8-fold higher than that detected by physician-ordered influenza testing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
