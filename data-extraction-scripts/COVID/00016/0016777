We evaluated six candidate proteins in plasma samples at day 7 after HCT and at onset of IPS from 41 IPS cases to identify potential IPS diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. Samples at similar times from 162 HCT recipients without documented infections and 37 HCT recipients with respiratory viral pneumonia served as controls. In multivariable models, a combination of Stimulation-2 (ST2, OR 2.8; p<0.001) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6, OR 1.4; p=0.025) was the best panel to distinguish IPS at diagnosis from unaffected controls, while tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1, OR 2.9; p=0.002) was the best marker when comparing patients with IPS and viral pneumonia. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for discriminating between IPS and unaffected controls at day 7 post-HCT were 0.8 for ST2, 0.75 for IL-6, and 0.68 for TNFR1. Using estimated sensitivity and specificity values from cutoffs determined with the ROC analysis (cutoff level: ST2, 21 ng/mL; IL-6, 61 pg/mL; TNFR1 3421 pg/mL), we calculated positive predictive values (PPV) for a range of estimated population prevalence values of IPS. Among the three markers, ST2 showed the highest PPV for IPS occurrence. Based on an 8% assumed prevalence, a positive ST2 test increased likelihood of IPS to 50%. We conclude that a prospective validation study is warranted to determine whether a plasma biomarker panel can help with the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of IPS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
