<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>How to approach major surgery where patients refuse blood transfusion (including Jehovah's Witnesses).</TITLE><BODY>Jehovah's Witnesses do not permit the use of allogeneic blood products. An increasing number of patients are refusing blood transfusion for non-religious reasons. In addition, blood stores are decreasing, and costs are increasing. Transfusion avoidance strategies are, therefore, desirable. Bloodless surgery refers to the co-ordinated peri-operative care of patients aiming to avoid blood transfusion, and improve patient outcomes. These principles are likely to gain popularity, and become standard practice for all patients. This review offers a practical approach to the surgical management of Jehovah's Witnesses, and an introduction to the principles of bloodless surgery that can be applied to the management of all patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
