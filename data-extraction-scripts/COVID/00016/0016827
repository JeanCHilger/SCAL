Macrophages activated by intraperitoneal injection of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), showed both extrinsic antiviral activity and high nitrite production in contrast to non-activated, resident macrophages. The extrinsic antiviral activity was observed in cultures of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2. The NO inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate (l-NMA) impaired the antiviral activity of HSV-elicited macrophages. The effect was dose dependent and correlated with a reduction of nitrite in the culture media. The effect of l-NMA was reversed by the addition of l-arginine. These data indicate that NO could be responsible for the described activity. Furthermore, l-NMA treatment resulted in the aggravation of HSV-1-induced keratitis in the mouse model, supporting a defensive role of NO in the pathogenesis of HSV-1 corneal infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
