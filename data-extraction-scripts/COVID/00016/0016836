Lymphocyte type 1 S1P receptor (S1P(1)) that transduces S1P chemotactic stimulation was recognized by patient Abs in Western blots of T cells, S1P(1) transfectants, and S1P(1)-hemagglutinin purified by monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin Ab absorption. The amino terminus of S1P(1), but not any extracellular loop, prevented anti-S1P(1) Ab suppression of S1P(1) signaling and T-cell chemotaxis to S1P. Human purified anti-S1P(1) Abs decreased mouse blood lymphocyte levels by a mean of 72%, suppressed mouse T-cell chemotaxis to S1P in vivo, and significantly reduced the severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice. Human Abs to the amino terminus of S1P(1) suppress T-cell trafficking sufficiently to impair host defense and provide therapeutic immunosuppression.â€”Liao, J.-J., Huang, M.-C., Fast, K., Gundling, K., Yadav, M., Van Brocklyn, J.
