Comparative estimates of the contribution of causative pathogens to the burden of disease are essential for targeted vaccine development. OBJECTIVE: To determine the viral etiology of severe pneumonia among infants and children at a rural Kenyan hospital using comprehensive and sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques. DESIGN, SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational and case control study during 2007 in a rural Kenyan district hospital. We recruited children age 1 day to 12 years who were resident in a systematically enumerated catchment area: i) those admitted to Kilifi District Hospital meeting WHO clinical criteria for ‘severe pneumonia’ or ‘very severe pneumonia’; ii) those presenting with mild upper respiratory tract infection but not admitted and iii) well infants and children attending for immunization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of respiratory viruses and the odds ratio for admission with severe disease. RESULTS: 759/922 (83%) eligible admissions were sampled (median age 9 months). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 425/759 (56%, 95% CI 52 to 60%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 260 (34%, 95% CI 31 to 38%) and other respiratory viruses in 219 (29%, 95% CI 26 to 32%), the commonest being human coronavirus 229E (n=51, 6.7%, 95% CI 5.0 to 8.7%), influenza type A (n=44, 5.8%, 95% CI 4.2 to 7.7%), parainfluenza type 3 (n=29, 3.8%, 95% CI 2.6 to 5.4%), adenovirus (n=29, 3.8%, 95% CI 2.6 to 5.4%) and human metapneumovirus (n=23, 3.0%, 95% CI 1.9 to 4.5%). Compared to well controls, detection of RSV was associated with severe disease (4% in controls, adjusted odds Ratio 6.11 [95% CI 1.65 to 22.6]) whilst collectively, other respiratory viruses were not (23% in controls, adjusted odds Ratio 1.27 [95% CI 0.64 to 2.52]). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of Kenyan infants and children admitted with severe pneumonia to a rural hospital, RSV was the predominant viral pathogen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
