<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-01-22</DATELINE><TITLE>P-Mart: Interactive Analysis of Ion Abundance Global Proteomics Data</TITLE><BODY>The use of mass-spectrometry-based techniques for global protein profiling of biomedical or environmental experiments has become a major focus in research centered on biomarker discovery; however, one of the most important issues recently highlighted in the new era of omics data generation is the ability to perform analyses in a robust and reproducible manner. This has been hypothesized to be one of the issues hindering the ability of clinical proteomics to successfully identify clinical diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of disease. P-Mart (https://pmart.labworks.org) is a new interactive web-based software environment that enables domain scientists to perform quality-control processing, statistics, and exploration of large-complex proteomics data sets without requiring statistical programming. P-Mart is developed in a manner that allows researchers to perform analyses via a series of modules, explore the results using interactive visualization, and finalize the analyses with a collection of output files documenting all stages of the analysis and a report to allow reproduction of the analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
