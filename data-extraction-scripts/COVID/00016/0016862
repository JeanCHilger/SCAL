This unfolded protein response (UPR) protects cells during transient stress and can lead to apoptosis during prolonged stress. Two key mediators of the UPR are PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), which phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), resulting in decreased protein synthesis, and the α subunit of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α), which initiates cytoplasmic splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). XBP1 induces transcription of genes involved in protein quality control. This report describes cross talk between these two pathways: phosphorylation of eIF2α was required for maximal induction of spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) protein levels via a mechanism that involved stabilization of XBP1s mRNA. By using mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in UPR signaling pathways, we demonstrate that stress-induced stabilization of XBP1s mRNA requires cytoplasmic splicing of the mRNA and inhibition of its translation. Because the XBP1s protein promotes transcription of its own gene, the UPR-induced mRNA stabilization is part of a positive feedback loop that induces XBP1s protein accumulation and transcription of target genes during stress. We propose a model in which eIF2α phosphorylation-mediated control of mRNA turnover is a molecular switch that regulates the stress response transcription program and the ER's capacity for protein folding during stress.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
