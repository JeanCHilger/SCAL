Here, we found that CARMA3, a scaffold protein previously shown to mediate NF-κB activation induced by GPCR and EGFR, positively regulates MAVS-induced NF-κB activation. However, our data suggest that CARMA3 sequesters MAVS from forming high-molecular weight aggregates, thereby suppressing TBK1/IRF3 activation. Interestingly, following NF-κB activation upon virus infection, CARMA3 is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation, which releases MAVS to activate IRF3. When challenged with Vesicular stomatitis virus or Influenza A virus, CARMA3-deficient mice showed reduced disease symptoms compared to those of wild type mice due to less inflammation and stronger ability to clear infected virus. Together, our studies reveal the role of CARMA3 in regulating the balance of host anti-viral and pro-inflammatory responses against RNA virus infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
