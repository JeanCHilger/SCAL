The role of defensins in viral pathogenesis in vivo is poorly understood; however, recent studies have revealed that defensin-virus interactions in vivo are complicated and distinct from their proposed antiviral mechanisms in vitro. These findings highlight the need for additional research that connects defensin neutralization of viruses in cell culture to in vivo antiviral mechanisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
