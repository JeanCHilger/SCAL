In the present study, a serum derived TF improved the ability of the recipient animal ability to survive high-risk infectious challenges (salmonellosis and canine parvoviral enteritis (CPV)) by altering the host cytokine response profile. Mice mortally challenged with 5,000 colony-forming units of Salmonella experienced a group mortality of 73% while mice treated with a single 5 mg dose of the TF demonstrated a significant decrease in morbidity (7%, p ≤ 0.01). The splenic bacterial load in untreated mice was over 10,000 times higher than that in the TF treated mice. Twenty-four hours post-administration, the treated murine population expressed a rapid temporal increase in serum IL-6 (26-fold) and INF-γ (77-fold) concentrations. IL-6 can act as a critical signal regulating action against bacterial pathogens. A comparative double-blind study performed using dogs confirmed to be undergoing a canine parvovirus challenge showed that when conventional supportive therapy was supplemented with a single 5 mg TF dose there was a reduction (p ≤ 0.01) in group mortality (68% of the TF treated group survived versus 32% of the placebo group), an observation consistent with the observed increase in INF-γ, a cytokine associated with promoting antiviral activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
