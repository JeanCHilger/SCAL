However, OFs contain particles of feed, feces, and inorganic material that detract from the quality of the sample. We clarified swine OF samples using lyophilized chitosan-based formulas (A–C) tested by PEDV IgG and IgA ELISAs. To evaluate both the immediate and residual effects of treatment on antibody detection, samples were tested immediately post-treatment, then stored at 4°C and retested at 2, 4, and 6 days post-treatment (DPT). Formulations were shown to effectively clarify samples. Statistical analysis comparing treated to untreated OF samples at 0 DPT found that neither chitosan nor Tween 20 affected the OF ELISA IgA and IgG sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio results (p > 0.05). Furthermore, pairwise comparisons of 0 DPT to 2, 4, and 6 DPT results detected no significant differences (p > 0.05) in IgA and IgG S/P ratios (i.e., treated OF samples were stable over time). Therefore, chitosan efficiently clarified OF specimens without affecting the results of the PEDV IgG and IgA antibody ELISAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
