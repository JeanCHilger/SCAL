Previous studies have documented that PRRSV nonstructural protein-1α (nsp1α) was an interferon antagonist, but the mechanism by which nsp1α inhibited the interferon (IFN)-β production was unclear. Here, by site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues of the zinc-finger (ZF) domain of nsp1α or by deletion of the ZF domain of nsp1α, we explored whether the ZF domain was required for nsp1α to disrupt the IFN-β production. The results showed that both mutagenesis of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues of the ZF domain and deletion of the ZF domain made nsp1α lose its interferon antagonism activity. In conclusion, our present work indicated that the ZF domain of nsp1α was necessary for nsp1α to inhibit the IFN-β induction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
