Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are important early responders during systemic viral infections and, in some cases, the sole producers of IFNα. However, their role in IFNα production during memory responses is unclear. We found that IFNα production is absent during a murine viral memory response despite colocalization of virus and pDCs to the splenic marginal zone. The absence of interferon was dependent on circulating antibody, and reversed by the transgenic expression of the activating human FcγRIIA receptor on pDCs. Furthermore, FcγRIIB was required for Sendai Virus immune complex (SeV IC) uptake by splenic pDCs in vitro and internalization via FcγRIIb prevented cargo from accessing TLR signaling endosomes. Thus, pDCs bind viral immune complexes via FcγRIIB, and prevent IFNα production in vivo during viral memory responses. This antibody-dependent, IFNα regulation maybe an important mechanism by which the potentially deleterious effects of IFNα are prevented during a secondary infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
