IL-27 functions through IL-27R and has been shown to have potent anti-tumor activity via activation of a variety of cellular components, including anti-tumor CD8(+) T-cell responses. However, the exact mechanisms of how IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CD8(+) T-cell responses remain unclear. Here we show that IL-27 significantly enhances the survival of activated tumor antigen specific CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo, and programs tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells into memory precursor (MPC)-like effector cells, characterized by upregulation of Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and IL-10. While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show here that IL-27-induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC phenotype induction, CTL memory, and tumor rejection. Thus, IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CTL responses via programming tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells into a unique memory precursor-type of effector cells characterized by a greater survival advantage. Our results have important implications for designing immunotherapy against human cancer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
