Here, we posit that inflammatory and acute-phase proteins in the circulation increase after O(3) exposure and systemically convey signals of O(3) exposure to the CNS. To model acute O(3) exposure, female Balb/c mice were exposed to 3 ppm O(3) or forced air for 2 h and were studied after 6 or 24 h. Of 23 cytokines and chemokines, only KC/CXCL1 was increased in blood 6 h after O(3) exposure. The acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) was significantly increased by 24 h, whereas C-reactive protein was unchanged. A-SAA in blood correlated with total leukocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage from O(3)-exposed mice. A-SAA mRNA and protein were increased in the liver. We found that both isoforms of A-SAA completely crossed the intact blood-brain barrier, although the rate of SAA2.1 influx was approximately 5 times faster than that of SAA1.1. Finally, A-SAA protein, but not mRNA, was increased in the CNS 24 h post-O(3) exposure. Our findings suggest that A-SAA is functionally linked to pulmonary inflammation in our O(3) exposure model and that A-SAA could be an important systemic signal of O(3) exposure to the CNS.â€”Erickson, M.
