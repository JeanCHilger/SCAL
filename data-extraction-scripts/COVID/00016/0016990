Infection of BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice expressing a dominant negative gamma interferon (IFN-γ) receptor specifically in oligodendrocytes was examined to determine the influence of IFN-γ signaling on pathogenesis. Inhibition of IFN-γ signaling in oligodendrocytes increased viral load, infection of oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and axonal damage resulting in increased mortality. IFN-γ levels and the inflammatory response were not altered, although the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA was increased. These data indicate that IFN-γ signaling by oligodendroglia reduces viral replication but affects both demyelination and tissue destruction in a host-specific manner.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
