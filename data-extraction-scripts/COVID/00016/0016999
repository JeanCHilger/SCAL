Here we demonstrate for the first time increased endothelial expression of CLEVER-1/stabilin-1 at sites of leucocyte recruitment to the inflamed human liver including sinusoids, septal vessels and lymphoid follicles in inflammatory liver disease and tumour-associated vessels in hepatocellular carcinoma. We used primary cultures of human sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSEC) to demonstrate that CLEVER-1/stabilin-1 expression is enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor but not by classical proinflammatory cytokines. We then showed that CLEVER-1/stabilin-1 supports T cell transendothelial migration across HSEC under conditions of flow with strong preferential activity for CD4 FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. CLEVER-1/stabilin-1 inhibition reduced Treg transendothelial migration by 40% and when combined with blockade of ICAM-1 and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) reduced it by more than 80%. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 60% of transmigrating Tregs underwent transcellular migration through HSEC via ICAM-1 and VAP-1 rich transcellular pores in close association with CLEVER-1/stabilin-1. Thus CLEVER-1/stabilin-1 and VAP-1 may provide an organ-specific signal for Treg recruitment to the inflamed liver and to hepatocellular carcinoma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
