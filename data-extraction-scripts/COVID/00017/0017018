Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs that can block infection of either a specific virus or a number of viruses. Viral entry is thought to be an ideal target for potential therapeutic prevention. One of the challenges of developing antivirals is that most of these viruses are highly pathogenic and therefore require high biosafety-level containment. In this study, we have adopted a comparative high-throughput screening protocol to identify entry inhibitors for three enveloped viruses (Marburg virus, influenza virus H5N1, and Lassa virus) using a human immunodeficiency virusâ€“based pseudotyping platform. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by screening a small compound library and identifying putative entry inhibitors for these viruses. One major advantage of this protocol is to reduce the number of false positives in hit selection, and we believe that the protocol is useful for inhibitor screening for many enveloped viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
