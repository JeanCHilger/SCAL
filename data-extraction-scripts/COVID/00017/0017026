<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Epidemiology and Management of Infectious Diseases in International Adoptees</TITLE><BODY>International adoptees represent a group of children with unique health care needs. Data from published studies, along with the recent experience of the Yale International Adoption Clinic, suggest that the risk of serious infections in adoptees is low, although infections associated with institutionalization still occur commonly. Interpretation of these data must be undertaken with caution, however, since many, if not most, international adoptees are not evaluated in specialty clinics. Thus, prospective studies designed to minimize selection and referral bias are needed in order to accurately define the risk of infectious and noninfectious diseases in all international adoptees.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
