Most hepatic macrophages and mDC are derived from monocytes recruited from blood via poorly understood interactions with hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSEC). Human CD16(+) monocytes are believed to contain the precursor populations for tissue macrophages and mDC. RESULTS: We report that CD16(+) cells localize to areas of active inflammation and fibrosis in chronic inflammatory liver disease and that a unique combination of cell surface receptors promotes the transendothelial migration of CD16(+) monocytes through human HSEC under physiological flow. CX(3)CR1 activation was the dominant pertussis-sensitive mechanism controlling transendothelial migration under flow and expression of the CX(3)CR1 ligand CX(3)CL1 is increased on hepatic sinusoids in chronic inflammatory liver disease. Exposure of CD16(+) monocytes to immobilized purified CX(3)CL1 triggered Î²1 integrin-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1 and induced the development of a migratory phenotype. Following transmigration or exposure to soluble CX(3)CL1, CD16(+) monocytes rapidly but transiently lost expression of CX(3)CR1. Adhesion and transmigration across HSEC under flow was also dependent on vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) on the HSEC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CD16(+) monocytes are recruited by a combination of adhesive signals involving VAP-1 and CX(3)CR1 mediated integrin-activation. Thus a novel combination of surface molecules, including VAP-1 and CX(3)CL1 promotes the recruitment of CD16(+) monocytes to the liver allowing them to localize at sites of chronic inflammation and fibrosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
