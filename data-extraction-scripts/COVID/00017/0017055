<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-05-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Compartmental Model Diagrams as Causal Representations in Relation to DAGs</TITLE><BODY>Compartmental model diagrams have been used for nearly a century to depict causal relationships in infectious disease epidemiology. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have been used more broadly in epidemiology since the 1990s to guide analyses of a variety of public health problems. Using an example from chronic disease epidemiology, the effect of type 2 diabetes on dementia incidence, we illustrate how compartmental model diagrams can represent the same concepts as causal DAGs, including causation, mediation, confounding, and collider bias. We show how to use compartmental model diagrams to explicitly depict interaction and feedback cycles. While DAGs imply a set of conditional independencies, they do not define conditional distributions parametrically. Compartmental model diagrams parametrically (or semiparametrically) describe state changes based on known biological processes or mechanisms. Compartmental model diagrams are part of a long-term tradition of causal thinking in epidemiology and can parametrically express the same concepts as DAGs, as well as explicitly depict feedback cycles and interactions. As causal inference efforts in epidemiology increasingly draw on simulations and quantitative sensitivity analyses, compartmental model diagrams may be of use to a wider audience. Recognizing simple links between these two common approaches to representing causal processes may facilitate communication between researchers from different traditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
