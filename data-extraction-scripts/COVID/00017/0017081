The efficacy of VSV-based vaccines can be improved by engineering vectors that enhance innate immune responses. We previously generated a VSV vaccine vector that incorporates two enhancing strategies: an M protein mutation (M51R) that prevents the virus from suppressing host antiviral responses and a gene encoding bacterial flagellin (M51R-F vector). The rationale was that intracellular expression of flagellin would activate innate immune pathways in addition to those activated by virus alone. This was tested with dendritic cells (DCs) from mice containing deletions in key signaling molecules. Infection of DC with either M51R or M51R-F vector induced the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-6 and increased surface expression of T cell costimulatory molecules. These responses were dramatically reduced in DCs from IPS-1(−/−) mice. Infection with M51R-F vector also induced the production of IL-1β. In addition, in approximately half of the DCs, M51R-F vector induced pyroptosis, a proinflammatory-type of cell death. These responses to flagellin were ablated in DCs from NLRC4(−/−) mice but not Toll-like receptor 5-deficient (TLR5(−/−)) mice, indicating that they resulted from inflammasome activation. These results demonstrate that flagellin induces additional innate immune mechanisms over those induced by VSV alone.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
