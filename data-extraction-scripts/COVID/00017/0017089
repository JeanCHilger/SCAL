La Crosse virus is historically transmitted by the native mosquito Aedes triseriatus (Say) in the upper Midwestern U.S., but the invasive congeners Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes japonicus (Theobald), which co-occur with A. triseriatus in water-holding containers, may be important accessory vectors in the Appalachian region where La Crosse encephalitis is an emerging disease. This review focuses on evidence for how climate, land use, and biological invasions may have direct abiotic and indirect community-level impacts on immature developmental stages (eggs and larvae) of Aedes mosquitoes. Because vector-borne diseases usually vary in space and time and are related to the ecology of the vector species, we propose that the ecology of its mosquito vectors, particularly at their immature stages, has played an important role in the emergence of La Crosse encephalitis in the Appalachian region and represents a model for investigating the effects of environmental changes on other vector-borne diseases. We summarize the health effects of La Crosse virus and associated socioeconomic costs that make it the most important native mosquito-borne disease in the U.S. We review of the transmission of La Crosse virus, and present evidence for the impacts of climate, land use, and biological invasions on Aedes mosquito communities. Last, we discuss important questions about the ecology of La Crosse virus mosquito vectors that may improve our understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on La Crosse virus and other arboviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
