Ligand recognition by TLR4 initiates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, leading to production of proinflammatory mediators and type I IFN. Ligand interaction also leads to internalization of the surface receptor complex into lysosomes, leading to the degradation of TLR4 and the termination of LPS response. However, surface level of TLR4 receptor complex is maintained via continuous replenishment of TLR4 from intracellular compartments like Golgi and endosomes. Here we show that continuous replenishment of TLR4 from Golgi to plasma membrane is regulated by the small GTPase Rab10, which is essential for optimal macrophage activation following LPS stimulation. Expression of Rab10 is inducible by LPS. Blockade of Rab10 function leads to decreased membrane TLR4 expression and diminished production of inflammatory cytokines and interferons upon LPS stimulation. These findings suggest that Rab10 expression provides a mechanism to refine TLR4 signaling by regulating the trafficking rate of TLR4 onto the plasma membrane. In addition, we show that altered Rab10 expression in macrophages influences disease severity in an in vivo model of LPS-induced acute lung injury, suggesting Rab10 as a possible therapeutic target for human acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
