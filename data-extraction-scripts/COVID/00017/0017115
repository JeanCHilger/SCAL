Spleen cells from TMEV-infected SJL/J mice stimulated with antigen-presenting cells infected with TMEV resulted in a population of autoreactive CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells that kill uninfected syngeneic cells. We established CD8(+) T cell clones that could kill both TMEV-infected and uninfected syngeneic targets, although infected target cells were killed more efficiently. The CD8(+) T-cell clones produced gamma interferon when incubated with either infected or uninfected syngeneic target cells. Intracerebral injection of the clones into na√Øve mice induced degeneration, not only in the brain, but also in the spinal cord. This suggests that CD8(+) Tc1 cells could play a pathogenic role in central nervous system inflammation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
