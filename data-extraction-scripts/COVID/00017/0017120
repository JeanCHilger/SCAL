Of the 371 samples examined, 9.4% (35/371) were positive for RVA. The RVA detection rates increased from 5.9% in 2004 and 8.5% in 2011 to 13.8% in 2012. A total of 23 positive samples were analyzed for RVA G and P genotypes. The dominant G-P combination was G9P[13] found in 60.9% of positive samples. The other combinations were G9P[7] (8.7%), G4P[13] (8.7%), G11P[13] (4.3%), and G11P[7] (4.3%). Sequence analysis of partial VP7 genes of selected strains revealed that the G4 strains were closely related to one another (95%) and, to a lesser extent, to human (82 to 84%) and porcine (84 to 86%) G4 strains. The G11 strains detected shared identical VP7 gene sequences (100%) and were closely related to human (85 to 86%) and other porcine (83%) G11 strains. The G9 strains identified were closely related to one another and to human and other porcine strains (96 to 97%, 89 to 91%, and 89 to 91% nucleotide identities, respectively). The VP4 gene analysis revealed that P[7] strains were closely related to each other and to P[7] strains isolated from porcine, bovine, and panda samples (91 to 99%, 92 to 99% and 92 to 99%, respectively). The P[13] strains showed a higher diversity among themselves and with other porcine P[13] strains, ranging from 83% to 99% and from 82 to 97%, respectively. Our results demonstrate broad genetic heterogeneity of the RVA strains and suggest the possibility of genetic reassortment between different RVA genotypes within these farms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
