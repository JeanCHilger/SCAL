Similarities have also been observed within different classes of signals that target proteins to membrane-less subnuclear compartments. Common localization signals affect spatial and temporal subcellular organization and are thought to allow the coordinated response of different molecular networks to a given signaling cue. Here we identify a higher-order and predictive code, {[RR(I/L)X(3)r]((n, n≥1))+[L(φ/N)(V/L)]((n,n>1))}, that establishes high-affinity interactions between a group of proteins and the nucleolus in response to a specific signal. This position-independent code is referred to as a nucleolar detention signal regulated by H(+) (NoDS(H+)) and the class of proteins includes the cIAP2 apoptotic regulator, VHL ubiquitylation factor, HSC70 heat shock protein and RNF8 transcription regulator. By identifying a common subnuclear targeting consensus sequence, our work reveals rules governing the dynamics of subnuclear organization and ascribes new modes of regulation to several proteins with diverse steady-state distributions and dynamic properties.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
