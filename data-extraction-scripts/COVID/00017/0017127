Since B cells are activated also by CD40 ligand (CD40L) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists via a similar signaling pathway, it is likely that costimulation through these molecules could result in synergistic enhancement of the transformation efficiency of EBV. In this study, the stimulatory effect of TLR7/8 (R848), TLR9 (CpG) agonists and/or CD40L on transformation efficiency of EBV in normal human B cells was assessed using the limiting dilution assay. Costimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with CpG and R848, but not CD40L, increased significantly the frequency of EBV transformed B cells (p < 0.001). Neither synergistic nor additive effects were observed between TLR agonists and CD40L and also TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists. Costimulation with R848, CpG and CD40L enhanced the proliferative response of B cells infected with EBV. This effect was more evident when enriched B cells were employed, compared to PBMCs. The promoting effect of TLR agonists stimulation, implies that EBV may take advantage of the genes induced by the TLR stimulation pathway for viral latency and oncogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
