In an attempt to develop the skin patch vaccine, we epicutaneously vaccinated Balb/c mice with AdCMV-hCPA. After nine weeks post-immunization, vaccinated mice evoked a robust antibody titer to CEA and demonstrated the capability of suppressing in vivo growth of implanted murine mammay adenocarioma cell line (JC-hCEA) tumor cells derived from a female Balb/c mouse. Proteomic analysis of the tumor masses in the non-vaccinated naïve and vaccinated mice reveal that six proteins change their abundance in the tumor mass. The levels of adenylate kinase 1, β-enolase, creatine kinase M chain, hemoglobin beta chain and prohibitin were statistically increased whereas the level of a creatine kinase fragment, which is undocumented, was decreased in the tumor of vaccinated mice. These proteins may provide a vital link between early-stage tumor suppression and immune response of skin patch vaccination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
