This innovative technology has proven extremely useful in the profiling of markers in a number of different disease states. Biochip arrays have also shown promise in clinical trials, offering rapid evaluation of multiple markers and circulating levels of the analyte with only a small sample. This biochip technology has broad applications in clinical, pharmaceutical, toxicological, immunologic and microbiologic areas. This technique offers parallel profiling and will have great value in personalized and precision medicine. The aim of this manuscript is to explore the recent and future utility of biochips for profiling marker levels in different diseased populations using RANDOXâ€™s Biochip Array Technology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
