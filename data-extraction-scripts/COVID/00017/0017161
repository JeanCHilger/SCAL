Since BVDV, dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) all belong to the Flaviviridae family, it seemed possible that a common step in their life cycle might be affected by this aminoglycoside. Here it is shown that geneticin prevented the cytopathic effect (CPE) resulting from DENV-2 infection of BHK cells, in a dose-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 3±0.4 μg/ml. Geneticin had no detectable effect on CPE caused byYFV in BHK cells. Geneticin also inhibited DENV-2 viral yield with an EC(50) value of 2±0.1 μg/ml and an EC(90) value of 20±2 μg/ml. With a CC(50) value of 165±5 μg/ml, the selectivity indexof anti-DENV activity of geneticin in BHK cells was established to be 66. Furthermore, 25 μg/ml of geneticin nearly completely blocked plaque formation induced by DENV-2, but not YFV. In addition, geneticin, inhibited DENV-2 viral RNA replication and viral translation. Gentamicin, kanamycin, and the guanidinylated geneticin showed no anti-DENV activity. Neomycin and Paromomycin demonstrated weak antiviral activity at high concentrations. Finally, aminoglycoside-3′-phosphotransferase activity of neomycin-resistant gene abolished antiviral activity of geneticin.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
