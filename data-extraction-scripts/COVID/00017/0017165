Although novel Mtb biomarkers from both the pathogen and host have been studied, more breakthroughs are still needed to meet different clinic requirements. In an effort to identify Mtb antigens, chaperone-peptide complexes were purified from TB infected lungs using free-solution isoelectric focusing combined with high resolution LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometry. Antigen specific cellular immune responses in vitro were then examined. Those efforts led to the identification of six Mtb peptides only identified in Tuberculosis lung samples and that were not found in the control samples. Additionally, antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion, T-cell proliferation, cytokine expression, and a cytotoxic assay were also evaluated. Among the peptides isolated, we identified a 34 amino acid peptide named PKA(p) belonging to a serine/threonine–protein kinase, as being able to generate Mtb-specific cellular immune responses as noted by elevated antigen-specific cytokine secretion levels, increased CD8(+) T-cell proliferation and a strong cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) response. Moreover, the immune stimulating abilities of PKA(p) were further validated in vivo, with target peptide immunized mice showing an increased cellular IFN-γ in both the lungs and spleen without causing immunopathogenesis. In conclusion, we identified novel functional Mtb antigens directly from the granulomatous lesions of Tuberculosis patients, inducing not only significant antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion but also a marked cytotoxic lymphocyte functional response. These findings indicated that PKA(p) has potential as a novel antigen biomarker for vaccine development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
