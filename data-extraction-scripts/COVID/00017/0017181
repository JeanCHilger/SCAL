Although HRSV was first identified in 1956, a preventative vaccine has yet to be developed. Here we report the results of the first study to investigate the circulation and genetic diversity of HRSV in Cambodia among an all-ages population over 5 consecutive years. The incidences of HRSV infection among all-ages outpatient and hospitalized populations were equivalent, at 9.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Infection was most prevalent among children aged <5 years, with bronchiolitis being the most frequently observed clinical syndrome in the same age group. Circulation of HRSV was seasonal, typically coinciding with the rainy season between July and November annually. Strains belonging to HRSV groups A and B were detected with equivalent frequencies; however, we observed a potentially biennial shift in the predominant circulating HRSV genotype. The majority of HRSV group B strains belonged to the recently described BA genotype, with the exception of 10 strains classified as belonging to a novel HRSV group B genotype, SAB4, first reported here.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
