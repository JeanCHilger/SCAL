Here we review the generation, characterization, and applications of monolayer-protected AuNPs that have been designed for immunorecognition by the integration of an oligopeptide epitope into the protecting monolayer. The resulting peptide-AuNP conjugate is an effective platform for biomimesis, as demonstrated by multiple studies. Recent work is presented and future directions for this field of research are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
