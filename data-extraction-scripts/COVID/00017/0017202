In all cells, regulation of volume is an essential function coupled to a variety of physiological processes and is a topic of interest. The objective here was to investigate involvement of ion channels in the process of volume regulation of Vero cells. Methods: Involvement of ion channels in cell volume regulation was studied using video‐microscopy and flow cytometry. Pharmacologically unaltered cells of different sizes, which are presumably at different phases of the cell cycle, were used. Results: Ion transport inhibitors altered all phases of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) of Vero cells, rate of initial cell swelling, V (max) and volume recovery. Effects were dependent on type of inhibitor and on cell size (cell cycle phase). Participation of aquaporins in RVD was suggested. Inhibitors decelerated growth, arresting Vero cells at the G(0)/G(1) phase boundary. Electrophysiological study confirmed presence of volume‐activated Cl(−) channels and K(+) channels in plasmatic membranes of the cells. Conclusion: Vero cells of all sizes maintained the ability to recover from osmotic swelling. Activity of ion channels was one of the key factors that controlled volume regulation and proliferation of the cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
