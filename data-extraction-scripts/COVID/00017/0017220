It remains a disease without a cure, as current treatments were developed with a focus on vasodilatory properties but do not reverse the remodeling component. Numerous recent advances have been made in the understanding of cellular processes that drive pathologic remodeling in each layer of the vessel wall as well as the accompanying maladaptive changes in the right ventricle. In particular, the past few years have yielded much improved insight into the pathways that contribute to altered metabolism, mitochondrial function, and reactive oxygen species signaling and how these pathways promote the proproliferative, promigratory, and antiapoptotic phenotype of the vasculature during PH. Additionally, there have been significant advances in numerous other pathways linked to PH pathogenesis, such as sex hormones and perivascular inflammation. Novel insights into cellular pathology have suggested new avenues for the development of both biomarkers and therapies that will hopefully bring us closer to the elusive goal: a therapy leading to reversal of disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
