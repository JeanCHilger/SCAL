The inhibitory potential of the established suppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGFÎ², has been well elucidated in diverse inflammatory scenarios in conjunction with their key roles in Treg development and function. Despite the early predictions for an immunomodulatory role for the Ebi3/p35 heterodimer in placental trophoblasts, IL-35 biology remained elusive until 2007 when it was established as a Treg-restricted inhibitory cytokine. Since then, Treg-derived IL-35 has been shown to exhibit its suppressive activities in a range of autoimmune diseases and cancer models. Recent studies are beginning to explore other cellular sources of IL-35, such as Bregs and CD8(+) Tregs. Despite these new cellular sources and targets, the mode of IL-35 suppression remains restricted to inhibition of proliferation and induction of an IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cell population referred to as iTr35. In this review, we explore the early beginnings, status quo, and future prospects of IL-35 biology. The unparalleled opportunity of targeting multiple immunosuppressive populations (Tregs, Bregs, CD8(+) Tregs) through IL-35 is highly exciting and offers tremendous promise from a translational standpoint, particularly for cancer immunotherapies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
