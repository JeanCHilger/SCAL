However, whether LMAN1 plays a role as a trafficking factor in the central nervous system is largely unknown. Here, we determined the role of LMAN1 on endogenous protein levels of the Cys-loop superfamily of neuroreceptors, including gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Knockdown of LMAN1 reduces the surface trafficking of endogenous β3 subunits of GABA(A)Rs in mouse hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of brain homogenates from LMAN1 knockout mice demonstrated that loss of LMAN1 decreases the total protein levels of 5HT(3)A receptors and γ2 subunits of GABA(A)Rs. LMAN1 knockout regulates the ER proteostasis network by upregulating ERP44 without changing calnexin levels. Interestingly, despite the critical role of the glycan-binding function of LMAN1 in its other known cargo clients, LMAN1 interacts with GABA(A)Rs in a glycan-independent manner. In summary, LMAN1 is a trafficking factor for certain neuroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is the first report of LMAN1 function in membrane protein trafficking.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
