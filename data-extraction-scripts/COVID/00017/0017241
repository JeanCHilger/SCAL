We estimate the effective reproductive number R(t) for the Beijing SARS epidemic, which represents the average number of secondary cases per primary case on each day of the epidemic and is therefore a measure of the underlying transmission dynamics. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of public health control measures. More generally, our results illustrate how changes in R(t) will reflect changes in the epidemic curve.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
