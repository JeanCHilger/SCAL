Six sets of primers were designed for LAMP technique targeting the conserved AC1 region and successfully detected ToLCBaV. No reaction was detected in the tissues of healthy plants by either the LAMP or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The LAMP products can be visualized by presence or absence of turbidity and staining (0.2 μL for 25 μL LAMP product) directly in the tube with nucleic acid stain dye which allowed easy detection. Sensitivity of LAMP assay is 100 times of conventional PCR technique. Although, both the LAMP and the PCR methods were capable of detecting ToLCBaV in infected tissues of tomato, the LAMP method would be more useful than the PCR method for detection of ToLCBaV infection in tomato plants because it is more rapid, simple and accurate method.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
