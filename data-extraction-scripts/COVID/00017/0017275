The ability of this sampler to collect infectious airborne viruses from a calm-air chamber loaded with influenza A virus was tested. The sampler’s efficiency at collecting aerosolized viral particles from a calm-air chamber is essentially the same as that from the high performance SKC BioSampler that collects un-fractionated particles directly into a liquid media (2.4 × 10(4) total viral particles per liter of sampled air (TVP/L) versus 2.6 × 10(4) TVP/L, respectively, after 15 min) and the efficiency is relatively constant over collection times of 15, 30 and 60 min. Approximately 34% of the aerosolized infectious virus collected after 15 min with the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler remained infectious, and infectious virus was found in all three size fractions. After 60 min of sampling, the infectious virus/liter air found in the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was 15% of that found in the SKC BioSampler. This preservation of infectivity by the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was maintained even when the initial infectivity prior to aerosolization was as low as 0.06%. The utility of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was further extended by incorporating an enhanced infectivity detection methodology developed in our laboratory, the viral replication assay, which amplified the infectious virus making it more readily detectable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
