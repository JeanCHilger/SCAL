The E-ELISA did not react with antisera to other known pathogens, indicating the E protein is specific for recognizing anti-TMUV antibodies. Compared to the serum neutralization test, the specificity and sensitivity of the E-ELISA was 93.2 and 97.8%, respectively. Therefore, this E-ELISA is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting antibodies against TMUV in ducks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
