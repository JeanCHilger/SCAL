<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-09-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Jun Activation Domain-binding Protein 1 (JAB1) Is Required for the Optimal Response to Interferons</TITLE><BODY>Degradation of IFN receptor (IFNR) protein is one of the mechanisms to limit the extent of cellular responses to interferons. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a JAK family kinase, has been reported to bind to and stabilize IFNR, indicating that TYK2 is a fundamental component of IFNR complex. Herein, we identified Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1) as a new TYK2 binding partner and investigated its role in the regulation of IFN responses. siRNA knockdown of JAB1 resulted in suppression of IFN-induced phosphorylation of STAT proteins and their transcriptional activation. Importantly, JAB1 knockdown induced the activation of SCF ubiquitin ligase complex containing Cullin 1 (CUL1), as judged by the enhancement of covalent modification of CUL1 with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8, and markedly reduced the basal protein level of IFNR. In contrast, NEDD8 knockdown or inhibition of NEDD8 modification by NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor resulted in increased IFNR protein concomitantly with a reduction of NEDD8-modified CUL1. Furthermore, NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor treatment enhanced the susceptibility to IFN-Î± in HeLa cells. These data suggest that the NEDD8 modification pathway is involved in the proteolysis of IFNR and that JAB1 acts as a positive regulator of IFN responses by stabilizing IFNR through antagonizing the NEDD8 pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
