<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-11-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Simple Tests for Rapid Detection of Canine Parvovirus Antigen and Canine Parvovirus-Specific Antibodies</TITLE><BODY>Canine parvovirus (CPV) is the number one viral cause of enteritis, morbidity, and mortality in 8-week-old young puppies. We have developed twin assays (slide agglutination test [SAT] for CPV antigen and slide inhibition test [SIT] for CPV antibody) that are sensitive, specific, cost-effective, generic for all genotypes of CPV, and provide instant results for CPV antigen detection in feces and antibody quantification in serum. We found these assays to be useful for routine applications in kennels with large numbers of puppies at risk. The results of these assays are available in 1 min and do not require any special instrumentation. SAT-SIT technology will find applications in rapid screening of samples for other hemagglutinating emerging viruses of animals and humans (influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
