The purpose of this study was to identify early infiltrating cells and to determine if infiltrating cells produced interferon γ (IFNγ). METHODS: Euthymic, female, BALB/c mice were injected in one AC with 3 × 10(4) PFU of HSV-1 (KOS) in a volume of 2µl. Mice from each group were sacrificed at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hrs post injection (p.i.), the eyes were enucleated and frozen sections were stained with antibodies specific for IFNγ, Mac-1 (CD11b), CD49b, F4/80, CD4, CD8 and CD11c. The same antibodies were also used to stain single cell suspensions of ocular cells for flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the anterior segment of the injected eye, the ciliary body and iris were virus infected and inflamed, and infiltrating cells increased throughout the period of observation. Mac-1+, CD49b+ and F4/80+ cells co-localized with IFNγ in the anterior segment as early as 12hrs p.i., and the percentage of Mac-1+ cells increased in the injected eye beginning at 24hrs p.i. and continued to 72hrs p.i. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrate that activated microglia are important IFNγ producing cells in the injected eye before day 3 and suggest that IFNγ produced by these cells may be involved in inhibition of anterior to posterior spread of virus in the injected eye.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
