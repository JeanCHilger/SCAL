Coordinated Recruitment of Conserved Host Functions by (+) ssRNA Viruses during Early Infection Events</TITLE><BODY>Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses have developed strategies to exploit cellular resources at the expense of host mRNAs. The genomes of these viruses display a variety of structures at their 5′ and 3′ ends that differentiate them from cellular mRNAs. Despite this structural diversity, viral RNAs are still circularized by juxtaposition of their 5′ and 3′ ends, similar to the process used by cellular mRNAs. Also reminiscent of the mechanisms used by host mRNAs, translation of viral RNAs involves the recruitment of translation initiation factors. However, the roles played by these factors likely differ from those played by cellular mRNAs. In keeping with the general parsimony typical of RNA viruses, these host factors also participate in viral RNA replication. However, the dual use of host factors requires that viral RNA template utilization be regulated to avoid conflict between replication and translation. The molecular composition of the large ribonucleoprotein complexes that form the viral RNA replication and translation machineries likely evolves over the course of infection to allow for switching template use from translation to replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
