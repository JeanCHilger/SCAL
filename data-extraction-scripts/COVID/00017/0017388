Antibodies present a major hurdle for ongoing clinical trials using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs); however, relatively little is known about the antigenic epitopes of most AAV serotypes or the mechanism(s) of antibody-mediated neutralization. We developed panels of AAV mAbs by repeatedly immunizing mice with AAV serotype 1 (AAV1) capsids, or by sequentially immunizing with AAV1 followed by AAV5 capsids, in order to examine the efficiency and mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization. The antibodies were not cross-reactive between heterologous AAV serotypes except for a low level of recognition of AAV1 capsids by the AAV5 antibodies, probably due to the initial immunization with AAV1. The neutralization efficiency of different IgGs varied and Fab fragments derived from these antibodies were generally poorly neutralizing. The antibodies appeared to display various alternative mechanisms of neutralization, which included inhibition of receptor-binding and interference with a post-attachment step.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
