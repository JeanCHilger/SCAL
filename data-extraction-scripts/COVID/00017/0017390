We amplified β-chain TCR transcripts by nonpalindromic adaptor (NPA)-PCR–Vβ-specific PCR. TCR transcripts from only five Vβ families (Vβ13, Vβ3, Vβ17, Vβ8, and Vβ20) were detected in CSF. The amplified products were combined, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed in the CSF substantial proportions of identical β-chain of TCR transcripts, demonstrating oligoclonal populations of T cells. Seventeen of 35 (48%) transcripts were 100% identical, demonstrating a major Vβ13.3 Dβ2.1 Jβ1.3 clonal expansion. Six of 35 (17%) transcripts were also 100% identical, revealing a second Vβ13 clonal expansion (Vβ13.1 Dβ2.1 Jβ1.2). Clonal expansions were also found within the Vβ3 family (transcript Vβ3.1 Dβ2.1 Jβ1.5 accounted for 5 of 35 transcripts [14%]) and within the Vβ20 family (transcript Vβ20.1 Dβ1.1 Jβ2.4 accounted for 3 of 35 transcripts [8%]). These results demonstrate the presence of T-cell oligoclonal expansions in the CSF of this patient following infection with hepatitis A virus. Analysis of the CDR3 motifs revealed that two of the clonally expanded T-cell clones exhibited substantial homology to myelin basic protein-reactive T-cell clones. In contrast, all Vβ TCR families were expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Oligoclonal expansions of T cells were not detected in the peripheral blood of this patient. It remains to be determined whether these clonally expanded T cells are specific for hepatitis A viral antigen(s) or host central nervous system antigen(s) and whether molecular mimicry between hepatitis A viral protein and a host protein is responsible for demyelinating disease in this patient.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
