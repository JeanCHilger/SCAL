<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Assessing the Status of Partnerships Between Academic Institutions and Public Health Agencies</TITLE><BODY>We identified, described, and defined models of academic institution–public health agency partnerships in Florida. The study involved a mixed-method research design using data collected from a survey of 67 county health department (CHD) administrators and directors in Florida, in-depth interviews of key informants, and reviews of relevant Florida statutes and other archival data providing context for the partnerships. Fifty-one of the CHDs (76%) participated in the survey. Most reported formal agreements involving 50 different academic institutions. The partnerships were perceived to enhance the local public health system’s capacity. Recommendations focus on the need for a multitiered system for recognition of the partnerships and expansion of federal support for partnership beyond existing approaches.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
