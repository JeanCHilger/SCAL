Previous reports are contradictory regarding an association with severe disease. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-six specimens from children with acute respiratory illness identified at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics Clinical Microbiology Laboratory (CML) were evaluated by DFA, and/or viral culture by CML and later by molecular study for the presence of influenza, parainfluenza (HPIV), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), adenovirus (HAdV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (HRV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: Multiple viruses were detected in 46 (21.7%) of 212 virus-positive specimens with the most frequent virus-virus combinations being HRV-HRSV (n=12), HRV-HBoV (n=6), and HRV-HPIV 3 (n=4). Risk factors for coinfection included: male gender (OR 1.70, 95% CI 0.83–3.46), 6 mos-1 yr age (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.75–6.19), and history of immunosuppression (OR 2.05, 95% CI 0.99–4.23). Children with viral coinfections were less likely than children with single virus infections to be admitted to an intensive care unit (OR 0.32, 95% CI 1.12–9.17), however, this may be explained by undetected viral-bacterial coinfections. CONCLUSIONS: HRV, HRSV, HBoV and polymicrobial infections were prevalent in this study. While the cross-sectional design could not easily examine polymicrobial infection and disease severity, prospective, population-based research regarding the clinical impact of such infections is warranted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
