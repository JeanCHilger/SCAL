HBoV2 has an identical genomic organization to HBoV but share only 78%, 67%, and 80% identity to its NS1, NP1 and VP1/VP2 proteins. Using PCR we detected HBoV2 sequences in 5/98 Pakistani children stool samples and 3/699 stool samples from the UK. Near full genome sequencing showed the presence of three divergent genotypes and evidence of recombination. Further studies are required to determine sites of replication of HBoV2 and potential associations with clinical symptoms or disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
