The A-AAA-AAG frameshift site of IS911 is flanked by two stimulatory elements, an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a downstream stem-loop. We show here that, while they can act independently, these stimulators have a synergistic effect when combined. Mutagenic analyses revealed features of the complex stem-loop that make it a low-efficiency stimulator. They also revealed the dual role of the upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence as (i) a stimulator of frameshifting, by itself more potent than the stem-loop, and (ii) a mandatory determinant of initiation of OrfB protein synthesis on an AUU codon directly preceding the A6G motif. Both roles rely on transient base pairing of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence with the 3′ end of 16S rRNA. Because of its effect on frameshifting, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is an important determinant of the level of transposase in IS911-containing cells, and hence of the frequency of transposition.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
