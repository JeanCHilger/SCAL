<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-05-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Critical Role of the PA-X C-Terminal Domain of Influenza A Virus in Its Subcellular Localization and Shutoff Activity</TITLE><BODY>PA-X is a recently identified influenza virus protein that is composed of the PA N-terminal 191 amino acids and unique C-terminal 41 or 61 residues. We and others showed that PA-X has a strong ability to suppress host protein synthesis via host mRNA decay, which is mediated by endonuclease activity in its N-terminal domain (B. W. Jagger, H. M.

Taubenberger, and P. Digard, 2012, Science 337:199–204, http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1222213, and E. A. Desmet, K. A. Bussey, R. Stone, and T. Takimoto, 2013, J Virol 87:3108–3118, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02826-12). However, the mechanism of host mRNA degradation, especially where and how PA-X targets mRNAs, has not been analyzed. In this study, we determined the localization of PA-X and the role of the C-terminal unique region in shutoff activity. Quantitative subcellular localization analysis revealed that PA-X was located equally in both cytoplasm and nucleus. By characterizing a series of PA-X C-terminal deletion mutants, we found that the first 9 amino acids were sufficient for nuclear localization, but an additional 6 residues were required to induce the maximum shutoff activity observed with intact PA-X. Importantly, forced nuclear localization of the PA-X C-terminal deletion mutant enhanced shutoff activity, highlighting the ability of nuclear PA-X to degrade host mRNAs more efficiently. However, PA-X also inhibited luciferase expression from transfected mRNAs synthesized in vitro, suggesting that PA-X also degrades mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Among the basic amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region, 3 residues, 195K, 198K, and 199R, were identified as key residues for inducing host shutoff and nuclear localization. Overall, our data indicate a critical role for the 15 residues in the PA-X C-terminal domain in degrading mRNAs in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses express PA-X proteins to suppress global host gene expression, including host antiviral genes, to allow efficient viral replication in infected cells. However, little is known about how PA-X induces host shutoff. In this study, we showed that PA-X localized equally in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cells, but the nuclear localization of PA-X mediated by its C-terminal region has a significant impact on shutoff activity. Three basic residues at the C-terminal region play a critical role in nuclear localization, but additional basic residues were required for maximum shutoff activity. Our findings indicate that PA-X targets and degrades mRNAs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and that the first 15 residues of the PA-X unique C-terminal region play a critical role in shutoff activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
