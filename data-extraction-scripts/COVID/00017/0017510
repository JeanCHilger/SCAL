Species Mamastrovirus 2, previously known as feline astrovirus, has been isolated from the feces of domestic cats and cheetahs. A total of 122 cat fecal samples from Alachua County, FL Animal Services and the Veterinary Community Outreach Program at the University of Florida were analyzed, and 35 contained astroviral RNA that was amplified and identified using consensus RT-PCR and sequence analysis. Using phylogenetic analysis, 19 of the astroviral sequences were identified as Mamastrovirus 2, making it the most prevalent astrovirus in this population. Three samples were identified as an astrovirus similar to viruses previously identified in foxes in The Netherlands and a cat in California, and one was similar to a bat astrovirus. One astroviral sequence was identified as an Avastrovirus. Although a causative relationship between mamastroviruses and enteric disease in cats has yet to be established, it is clear that mamastroviruses are prevalent, and an understanding of prevalence of astroviral types may help direct future test development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
