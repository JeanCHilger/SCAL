However, little is known about how Treg contribute to immune regulation during memory responses to previously-encountered pathogens. Here we utilized influenza NP(311-325)/IA(b) Class II tetramers to track the antigen-specific Treg response to primary and secondary influenza virus infections. During secondary infections, antigen-specific memory Treg showed accelerated accumulation in the lung-draining lymph node and lung parenchyma relative to a primary infection. Memory Treg effectively controlled the in vitro proliferation of memory CD8(+) cells in an antigen-specific fashion that was MHC class II dependent. When memory Treg were depleted prior to secondary infection, the magnitude of the antigen-specific memory CD8(+) T cell response was increased, as was pulmonary inflammation and airway cytokine/chemokine expression. Replacement of memory Treg with na√Øve Treg failed to restore the regulation of the memory CD8 T cell response during secondary infection. Together, these data demonstrate the existence of a previously undescribed population of antigen-specific memory Treg that shape the cellular immune response to secondary influenza virus challenges and offer an additional parameter to consider when determining the efficacy of vaccinations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
