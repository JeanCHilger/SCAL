METHODS: This prospective cohort enrolled previously healthy term infants during inpatient or outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory illness (URI) or bronchiolitis during September - May 2004â€“2008. Illness severity was determined using an ordinal bronchiolitis severity score. Common respiratory viruses were identified by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of 648 infants, 67% were enrolled during inpatient visits and 33% during outpatient visits. Seventy percent had bronchiolitis, 3% croup, and 27% URI. Among infants with bronchiolitis, 76% had RSV, 18% HRV, 10% influenza, 2% coronavirus, 3% HMPV, and 1% PIV. Among infants with croup, 39% had HRV, 28% PIV, 28% RSV, 11% influenza, 6% coronavirus, and none HMPV. Among infants with URI, 46% had HRV, 14% RSV, 12% influenza, 7% coronavirus, 6% PIV, and 4% HMPV. Individual viruses exhibited distinct seasonal, demographic, and clinical expression. CONCLUSIONS: The most common infections among infants seeking care in unscheduled medical visits for URI or bronchiolitis were RSV and HRV. Demographic differences were observed between patients with different viruses, suggesting that host and viral factors play a role in phenotypic expression of viral illness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
