The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian Aedes sp. mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of re-establishment of urban YFV transmission in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial and genomic approaches to characterize YFV transmission. We show that the age- and sex-distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic transmission. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV transmission and spatial expansion towards previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV transmission in real-time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
