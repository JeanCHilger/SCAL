The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of kimchi methanol extract (KME) and a kimchi active compound, 3-(4′-hydroxyl-3′,5′-dimethoxyphenyl)propionic acid (HDMPPA) on cholesterol flux in THP-1-derived macrophages treated with oxLDL. The effects of KME and HDMPPA on cell viability and lipid peroxidation were determined. Furthermore, the protein expression of PPARγ, CD36, PPARα, LXRα, and ABCA1 was examined. OxLDL strongly induced cell death and lipid peroxidation in THP-1-derived macrophages. However, KME and HDMPPA significantly improved cell viability and inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by oxLDL in THP-1-derived macrophages (P<.05). Moreover, KME and HDMPPA suppressed CD36 and PPARγ expressions, both of which participate in cholesterol influx. In contrast, KME and HDMPPA augmented LXRα, PPARα, and ABCA1 expression, which are associated with cholesterol efflux. Consequently, KME and HDMPPA suppressed lipid accumulation. These results indicate that KME and HDMPPA may inhibit lipid accumulation, in part, by regulating cholesterol influx- and efflux-related proteins. These findings will thus be useful for future prevention strategies against atherosclerosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
