The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential role of PRINS in diabetic nephropathy. The relative mRNA expression level of PRINS and SMAD family member 7 (Smad7) was examined in patients with diabetes, including patients without obvious complications (n=43), patients with diabetic nephropathy (n=33), diabetic retinopathy (n=37), diabetic cardiomyopathy (n=29), diabetic lung disease (n=38) and healthy controls (n=48). Correlation analysis between the expression level of PRINS and Smad7 was analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis. In addition, overexpression of PRINS was confirmed in mouse podocyte cells and cell viability and Smad7 protein expression was detected by MTT assay and western blot analysis, respectively. The expression levels of PRINS and Smad7 were significantly increased in patients with diabetes compared with healthy controls. In addition, the expression levels of PRINS and Smad7 were significantly increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with other diabetic complications. The expression level of PRINS in mouse podocyte cells was upregulated following treatment with high glucose. A significant positive correlation between the expression level of PRINS and Smad7 was observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, there was no correlation was observed in other patient groups compared with healthy controls. Overexpression of PRINS decreased the viability of mouse podocyte cells and enhanced Smad7 protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that PRINS may be involved in the development of nephropathy in patients with diabetes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
