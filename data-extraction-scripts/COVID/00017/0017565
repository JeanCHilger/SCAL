Here, we asked whether an augmented ability to sense antigen complemented their role as early alarms of pathogen invasion. Using mouse polyomavirus (MPyV), we show that brain-resident MPyV-specific CD8 T cells, unlike memory cells in the spleen, progressively increase binding to MHC class I tetramers and CD8 co-receptor expression. Using the two-dimensional micropipette adhesion frequency assay, we show that T(RM) cells in brain, as well as in kidney, express up to 20-fold higher affinity T cell receptors (TCRs) than splenic memory T cells, whereas effector cells express TCRs of similar high affinity in all organs. Together, these data demonstrate that T(RM) cells retain high TCR affinity, which endows them with the high antigen sensitivity needed for front-line defense against infectious agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
