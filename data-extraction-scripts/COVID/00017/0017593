Both are synthesized as one precursor protein and stay noncovalently attached after cleavage. In this study, we determined the oligomeric state of the LCMV GP and expressed it in two different conformations suitable for structural analysis. Sequence analysis of GP-2 identified a trimeric heptad repeat pattern containing an N-terminal α-helix. An α-helical peptide matching this region formed a stable oligomer as revealed by gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering. In contrast, a second α-helical peptide corresponding to a predicted C-terminal α-helix within GP-2 did not oligomerize. Refolding of the complete GP-2 ectodomain revealed trimeric all-alpha complexes probably representing the six-helix bundle state that is considered a hallmark of class I viral fusion proteins. Based on these results, we generated a construct consisting of the complete uncleavable LCMV GP ectodomain fused C-terminally to the trimeric motif of fibritin. Gel filtration analysis of the secreted fusion protein identified two complexes of ∼230 and ∼440 kDa. Both complexes bound to a set of conformational and linear antibodies. Cross-linking confirmed the 230-kDa complex to be a trimer. The 440-kDa complexes were found to represent disulfide-linked pairs of trimers, since partial reduction converted them to a complex species migrating at 250 kDa. By electron microscopy, the 230-kDa complexes appeared as single spherical particles and showed no signs of rosette formation. Our results clearly demonstrate that the arenavirus GP is a trimer and must be considered a member of the class I viral fusion protein family.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
