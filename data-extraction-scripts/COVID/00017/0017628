In the present study, we have attempted to clarify the mechanisms that regulate antibody production by in vitro immunized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Freshly isolated PBMC did not induce antibody production following in vitro immunization, but expressed the interleukin (IL)-10 gene. On the other hand, PBMC pretreated with l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester (LLME) induced antibody production, but did not express the IL-10 gene. IL-10 induced functional impairment of CD4(+) Th cells and CD11c(+) DC, resulting in the suppression of antibody production by in vitro immunized PBMC.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
