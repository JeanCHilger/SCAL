The performance of the Allplex assay was compared with those of the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR kit (AdvanSure) and the PowerChek pandemic H1N1/H3N2/H5N1 real-time PCR kit (PowerChek) using 417 clinical respiratory specimens. In comparison with the AdvanSure assay for RV detection by each virus, the ranges of positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and kappa values with the Allplex assay were 82.8 to 100%, 95.5 to 100%, and 0.85 to 1.00, respectively. For influenza A virus (INF A) subtyping, the kappa values between the Allplex and PowerChek assays were 0.67 and 1.00 for the INF A H1N1-pdm09 and H3 subtypes, respectively. Uniplex PCR and sequencing for samples with discrepant results demonstrated that the majority of results were concordant with those from the Allplex assay. When testing 24 samples, the turnaround and hands-on time required to perform the Allplex assay were 4 h 15 min and 15 min, respectively. In conclusion, the Allplex assay produced results comparable to those from the AdvanSure and PowerChek assays.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
