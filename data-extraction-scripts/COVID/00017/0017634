<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-05-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Complexities of Viral Mutation Rates</TITLE><BODY>Many viruses evolve rapidly. This is due, in part, to their high mutation rates. Mutation rate estimates for over 25 viruses are currently available. Here, we review the population genetics of virus mutation rates. We specifically cover the topics of mutation rate estimation, the forces that drive the evolution of mutation rates, and how the optimal mutation rate can be context-dependent.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
