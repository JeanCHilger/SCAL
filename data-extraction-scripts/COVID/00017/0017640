Presumably, PRRSV infection enhances PCV2 replication as a result of modulation of host immunity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PCV2 replication and pathogenesis in pigs vaccinated with a PRRS modified live virus (MLV) vaccine and subsequently challenged with a combination of PRRSV and PCV2. During the early postchallenge period, the number of pigs with PRRSV-associated clinical signs was decreased, and average daily gain (ADG) was increased, in the vaccinated group, demonstrating the protective effect of PRRS vaccination. However, during the later postchallenge period, more pigs in the vaccinated group showed increased PCV2 viremia, decreased ADG, increased PCVAD clinical signs, and increased mortality. In this disease model, the early benefits of PRRSV vaccination were outweighed by the later amplification of PCVAD.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
