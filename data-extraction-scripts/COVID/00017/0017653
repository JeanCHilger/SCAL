In this study, we examined the role of CEACAM1 in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein, a homophilic ligand of CEACAM1, inhibited the severity of EAE and reduced myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-derived peptide (MOG(35–55))-reactive interferon-γ and interleukin-17 production. In contrast, treatment of these animals with AgB10, an anti-mouse CEACAM1 blocking monoclonal antibody, generated increased severity of EAE in association with increased MOG(35–55)-specific induction of both interferon-γ and interleukin-17. These results indicated that the signal elicited through CEACAM1 ameliorated EAE disease severity. Furthermore, we found that there was both a rapid and enhanced expression of CEACAM1 on invariant natural killer T cells after activation. The effect of CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein and anti-CEACAM1 mAb on both EAE and MOG(35–55)-reactive cytokine responses were abolished in invariant natural killer T cell–deficient Jα18(−/−) mice. Taken together, the ligation of CEACAM1 negatively regulates the severity of EAE by reducing MOG(35–55)-specific induction of both interferon-γ and interleukin-17 via invariant natural killer T cell-dependent mechanisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
