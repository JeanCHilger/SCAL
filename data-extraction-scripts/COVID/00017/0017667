Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, Chlamydophila or Mycoplasma have been hypothesized to have significant roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. Progress is being made toward establishing the mechanisms by which these agents can cause acute wheezing and impact the pathophysiology of asthma. Host factors probably contribute to the risk of asthma inception and exacerbation, and these contributions may also vary with respect to early- versus adult-onset disease. This review discusses these various associations as they pertain to the development and exacerbation of asthma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
