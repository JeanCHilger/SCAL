<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-08-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Comparison of the GenMark Diagnostics eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel to Real-Time PCR for Detection of Respiratory Viruses in Children</TITLE><BODY>A novel eSensor respiratory viral panel (eSensor RVP) multiplexed nucleic acid amplification test (GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was compared to laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays for the detection of various respiratory viruses. A total of 250 frozen archived pediatric respiratory specimens previously characterized as either negative or positive for one or more viruses by real-time PCR were examined using the eSensor RVP. Overall agreement between the eSensor RVP and corresponding real-time PCR assays for shared analytes was 99.2% (kappa = 0.96 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.94 to 0.98]). The combined positive percent agreement was 95.4% (95% CI, 92.5 to 97.3); the negative percent agreement was 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4 to 99.8). The mean real-time PCR threshold cycle (C(T)) value for specimens with discordant results was 39.73 (95% CI, 38.03 to 41.43). Detection of coinfections and correct identification of influenza A virus subtypes were comparable between methods. Of note, the eSensor RVP rhinovirus assay was found to be more sensitive and specific than the corresponding rhinovirus real-time PCR. In contrast, the eSensor RVP adenovirus B, C, and E assays demonstrated some cross-reactivity when tested against known adenovirus serotypes representing groups A through F. The eSensor RVP is robust and relatively easy to perform, it involves a unique biosensor technology for target detection, and its multiplexed design allows for efficient and simultaneous interrogation of a single specimen for multiple viruses. Potential drawbacks include a slower turnaround time and the need to manipulate amplified product during the protocol, increasing the possibility of contamination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
