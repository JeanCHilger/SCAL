This stimulation, which also occurs with DNA or RNA-containing immune complexes and synthetic TLR7 and −9 agonists, is dependent upon the transcription factor IRF-7, which is expressed at high constitutive levels in pDC. In addition to releasing as much as 3−10 pg of IFN-α/cell, pDC are also potent modulators of the immune response. In this review, we discuss the signaling pathways in pDC, their roles in linking innate and adaptive immunity, and their roles in infectious disease and autoimmunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
