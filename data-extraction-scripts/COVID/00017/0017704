We describe the incidence and clinical impact of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), a newly identified virus, in adults. METHODS: hMPV infection was identified in three prospectively enrolled adult cohorts (young persons age 19-40, healthy adults â‰¥ 65 years, and high-risk adults) and a hospitalized cohort over 4 consecutive winters. The incidence and clinical impact was compared to influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection in the same groups. RESULTS: Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology hMPV infection was identified in 2.2-10.5% of the three prospectively followed outpatient cohorts annually. Asymptomatic infection was common, accounting for at least 40% of infections in each of the cohorts. Symptoms, when they did occur, were typical of an upper respiratory illness although a few high-risk persons required hospitalization. Among 1386 hospitalized subjects, hMPV was identified in 8.5%, ranging from 4.3% to 13.2% depending upon the year. Dual viral infection was identified in 22.9%. Wheezing was frequent (80%) and more common than with influenza. Twelve percent required intensive care unit admission and 11% ventilatory support, rates similar to influenza and RSV infection. CONCLUSION: hMPV is a common infection in adults of all ages, and although often asymptomatic, can result in serious infection requiring hospitalization. Like influenza A and RSV, hMPV is also a major contributor to the burden of winter-time respiratory illnesses in older adults.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
