Here we review the growing number of proteins known to be regulated by S-palmitoylation in immune cells emerging from recent advances in chemical proteomics. These chemical proteomic studies have highlighted the roles of this dynamic lipid modification in regulating the specificity and strength of immune responses in different lymphocyte populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
