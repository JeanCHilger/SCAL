The viral RNA was expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and the intron was efficiently removed during translocation of this RNA to the cytoplasm. The insertion in two different positions allowed stable plasmid amplification for at least 200 generations. Infectious TGEV was efficiently recovered from cells transfected with the modified cDNAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
