<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-08-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Ribavirin is not a functional mimic of the 7-methyl guanosine mRNA cap</TITLE><BODY>Ribavirin is a guanosine ribonucleoside analog that displays broad-spectrum anti-viral activity and is currently used for the treatment of some viral infections. Ribavirin has recently been proposed to also be a mimic of the 7-methyl guanosine cap found at the 5â€² end of mRNAs. To obtain supporting functional data for this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of ribavirin triphosphate to interfere with the interaction between eIF4E and 7-methyl guanosine capped mRNA. In chemical cross-linking assays, cap-affinity chromatography, and cap-dependent translation assays, ribavirin was unable to function as a cap analog.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
