METHODS: A total of 180 healthy infants were enrolled from birth and monitored for occurrences of URI and its LRI and acute otitis media (AOM) complications until the first AOM episode or between 6 and 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens collected during acute respiratory illnesses were tested for 18 viruses. RESULTS: Between October 2008 and April 2011, 373 URI episodes, including 20 with LRI, in 139 infants were documented. Viral studies were performed on 189 URI episodes; 87% were positive. Throughout the 31-month period (1386 patient-months), rhinovirus was the predominant virus causing URI (55%); RSV was the major cause of LRI (64%). While there was a significant increase in parent-initiated visit rate during the 15-month influenza pandemic as compared with pre- and post- pandemic periods, only 4 cases of influenza were detected (2 cases during and 2 cases pre- and post- pandemic). CONCLUSION: The 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic had no impact on the overall viral epidemiology of respiratory infections in healthy infants in the first year of life but resulted in increased parent-initiated visits due to respiratory symptoms. Maternal antibody and absence of co-morbidity may explain the low influenza burden while parental anxiety may explain the increased healthcare visit rate during the pandemic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
