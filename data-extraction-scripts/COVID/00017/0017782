<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-08-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus</TITLE><BODY>We used swine testicle (ST) cells infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and an indirect immunofluorescent assay with antibodies against TGEV spike and nucleocapsid proteins to screen small-molecule compounds that inhibit TGEV replication. Analogues of initial hits were collected and subjected to a 3CL protease (3CL(pro)) inhibition assay with recombinant 3CL(pro) and a fluorogenic peptide substrate. A series of benzothiazolium compounds were found to have inhibitory activity against TGEV 3CL(pro) and to exert anti-TGEV activities in terms of viral protein and RNA replication in TGEV-infected ST cells, with consequent protection of TGEV-infected ST cells from cytopathic effect by blocking the activation of caspase-3.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
