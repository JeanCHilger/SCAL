At each stage of the immune response, there are stimulatory and inhibitory signals that regulate the magnitude, quality, and character of the response. Positive regulation promotes an antiviral state to control and eventually clear infection whereas negative regulation dampens inflammation and prevents immune-mediated tissue damage. An over-exuberant innate immune response can lead to the destruction of cells and tissues, and the development of spontaneous autoimmunity. The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) belong to a family of cytosolic host RNA helicases that recognize distinct non-self RNA signatures and trigger innate immune responses against several RNA virus infections. The RLR signaling pathway is tightly regulated to achieve a well-orchestrated response aimed at maximizing antiviral immunity and minimizing immune-mediated pathology. This review highlights contemporary findings on negative regulators of the RLR signaling pathway, with specific focus on the proteins and biological processes that directly regulate RIG-I, MDA5 and MAVS function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
