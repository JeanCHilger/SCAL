For example, HIV-1 has an absolute reliance on frameshifting to produce the correct ratio of key proteins critical for infectivity. To exploit such recoding sites as therapeutic targets, a simple homogeneous assay capable of detecting small perturbations in these low-frequency (<5%) events is required. Current assays based on dual luciferase reporters use expensive substrates and are labor-intensive, both impediments for high-throughput screening. We have developed a cell-based bifluorophore assay able to measure accurately small recoding changes (<0.1%) with a high Zâ€²-factor in 24- or 96-well formats that could be extended to 384 wells. In cases of nonsense mutations arising within coding regions of genes, the assay is suitable for assessing the potential of screened compounds to increase read-through at these nonprogrammed stop signals of variable termination efficiency.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
