The UPR components X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) promote type I interferon (IFN) responses. Here, we found that Xbp1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages had impaired antiviral resistance. Unexpectedly, this was not because of a defect in type I IFN responses, but rather an inability of Xbp1-deficient cells to undergo viral-induced apoptosis. The ability to undergo apoptosis directly limited infection in WT cells. Xbp1-deficient cells were generally resistant to the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through an indirect mechanism involving activation of the nuclease IRE1α. We observed an IRE1α-dependent reduction in the abundance of the pro-apoptotic microRNA miR-125a, and a corresponding increase in the amounts of the members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family. The activation of IRE1α by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein NS4B in Xbp1-proficient cells also conferred apoptosis resistance and promoted viral replication. Furthermore, we found evidence of IRE1α activation and decreased miR-125a abundance in liver biopsies from patients infected with HCV compared to those in the livers of healthy controls. Our results reveal a pro-survival role for IRE1α in virally infected cells, and suggest a possible target for IFN-independent antiviral therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
