<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral resistance of MOGS-CDG patients implies a broad-spectrum strategy against acute virus infections</TITLE><BODY>Sadat et al reported in the 2014 April 24 issue of New England Journal of Medicine that patients genetically deficient in the gene encoding mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase (MOGS), also known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glucosidase I, manifested a severe hypogammaglobulinemia without clinical evidence of an infectious diathesis. This paradox phenomenon is, at least in part, because the impaired N-linked glycan processing of the patients compromises their ability to support efficient replication and cellular entry of viruses. This finding unambiguously validates ER glucosidases as valuable targets for antiviral agents against a broad-spectrum of enveloped viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
