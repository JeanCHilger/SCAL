We describe 34 cases from 4 diarrheal outbreaks caused by RV in unvaccinated farrowing units in southern Brazil from 2011 to 2013. We performed autopsy, histologic examinations, bacterial culture, RV immunohistochemistry (IHC), and enteric virus detection through molecular assays for rotavirus A, B, and C, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, sapovirus, norovirus, and kobuvirus. Histologically, villus atrophy (29 of 34) and epithelial vacuolation (27 of 34) occurred in all 4 outbreaks. Cell debris in the lamina propria occurred in 20 cases, mostly from outbreaks A (8 of 11), C (4 of 6), and D (7 of 11). IHC was positive for RV in 21 of 34 samples. RT-PCR was positive for RV in 20 of 30 samples; RV-C was the most frequently detected RV (n = 17). Kobuvirus was detected in 11 samples, and, in 3 of them, there was single detection of this enteric virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
