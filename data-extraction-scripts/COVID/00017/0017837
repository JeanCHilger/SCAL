METHODS: Hepatitis virus infection-associated genes were obtained by collecting the data from databases and retrieving the correlated articles, and their expression changes in the regenerating rat liver were detected with the rat genome 230 2.0 array. RESULTS: Eighty-eight genes were found to be associated with liver regeneration. The number of genes initially and totally expressed during initial LR [0.5-4 h after partial hepatectomy (PH)], transition from G0 to G1 (4-6 h after PH), cell proliferation (6-66 h after PH), cell differentiation and reorganization of structure-function (66-168 h after PH) was 37, 8, 48, 3 and 37, 26, 80, 57, respectively, indicating that the genes were mainly triggered at the early stage of LR (0.5-4 h after PH), and worked at different phases. These genes were classified into 5 types according to their expression similarity, namely 37 up-regulated, 9 predominantly up-regulated, 34 down-regulated, 6 predominantly down-regulated and 2 up/down-regulated genes. Their total up- and down-regulation frequencies were 359 and 149 during LR, indicating that the expression of most genes was enhanced, while the expression of a small number of genes was attenuated during LR. According to time relevance, they were classified into 12 groups (0.5 and 1 h, 2 and 4 h, 6 h, 8 and 12 h, 16 and 96 h, 18 and 24 h, 30 and 42 h, 36 and 48 h, 54 and 60 h, 66 and 72 h, 120 and 144 h, 168 h), demonstrating that the cellular physiological and biochemical activities during LR were fluctuated. According to expression changes of the genes, their expression patterns were classified into 23 types, suggesting that the cellular physiological and biochemical activities during LR were diverse and complicated. CONCLUSION: The anti-virus infection capacity of regenerating liver can be enhanced and 88 genes play an important role in LR.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
