Control over these processes is achieved via an extensive combination of pumps and channels which regulate the concentration of Ca(2+) within not only the cytosol but also all intracellular compartments. Precisely how these pumps and channels are regulated is only partially understood, however, recent investigations have identified members of the Early Growth Response (EGR) family of zinc finger transcription factors as critical players in this process. The roles of several other transcription factors in control of Ca(2+) homeostasis have also been demonstrated, including Wilms Tumor Suppressor 1 (WT1), Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) and c-myc. In this review, we will discuss not only how these transcription factors regulate the expression of the major proteins involved in control of Ca(2+) homeostasis, but also how this transcriptional remodeling of Ca(2+) homeostasis affects Ca(2+) dynamics and cellular responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
