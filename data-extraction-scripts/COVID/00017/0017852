<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-01-27</DATELINE><TITLE>The Central RAS and Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Chronic Heart Failure</TITLE><BODY>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a multi-factorial disease process that is characterized by over activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system. Both of these systems are chronically activated in CHF. The RAAS consists of an excitatory arm involving Angiotensin II (Ang II), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), and the Ang II type 1 Receptor (AT1R). The RAAS also consists of a protective arm consisting of Angiotensin-1-7 (Ang -1-7), the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R), ACE2 and the mas receptor. Sympathoexcitation in CHF is driven, in large part, by an imbalance of these two arms, with an increase in the Ang II-AT1R-ACE arm and a decrease in the AT2R-ACE2 arm. This imbalance is manifested in cardiovascular-control regions of the brain such as the rostral ventrolateral medulla and paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus. This review focuses on current literature that describes the components of these two arms of the RAAS, and their imbalance in the CHF state. Moreover, this review provides additional evidence for the relevance of ACE2 and Ang-1-7 as key players in the regulation of central sympathetic outflow in CHF. Finally we also examine the effects of exercise training as a therapeutic strategy and the molecular mechanisms at play in CHF, in part, because of the ability of exercise training to restore the balance of the RAAS axis and sympathetic outflow.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
