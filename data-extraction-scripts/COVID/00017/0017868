The differential demyelination properties of RSA59 and RSMHV2 may be a function of spike protein-mediated neuronal transport. Disruption of microtubules with colchicine and vinblastine significantly blocks neuronal transport and reduces the replication of RSA59, whereas RSMHV2 remains unaffected.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
