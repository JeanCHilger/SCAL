<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-10-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Camouflage and Misdirection: The Full-On Assault of Ebola Virus Disease</TITLE><BODY>Ebolaviruses cause a severe hemorrhagic fever syndrome that is rapidly fatal to humans and non-human primates. Ebola protein interactions with host cellular proteins disrupt Type I and Type II interferon responses, RNAi anti-viral responses, antigen presentation, T-cell mediated antibody responses, humoral antibodies and cell mediated immunity. This multifaceted approach to evasion and suppression of innate and adaptive immune responses in their target hosts leads to the severe immune dysregulation and “cytokine storm” that is characteristic of fatal ebolavirus infection. Here we highlight some of the processes by which Ebola interacts with its mammalian hosts to evade anti-viral defenses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
