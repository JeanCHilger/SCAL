The lymphoid-restricted serine/threonine kinase DAP-related apoptotic kinase-2 (DRAK2) raises the TCR activation threshold by targeting TCR-induced calcium mobilization in thymocytes and peripheral T cells, and regulates positive thymic selection and peripheral T cell activation. Despite a hypersensitivity of peripheral drak2-deficient T cells, drak2-deficient mice are enigmatically resistant to induced autoimmunity in the model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In order to further evaluate the differential role of DRAK2 in central versus peripheral tolerance and to assess its impact on the development of autoimmune diseases, we have generated a transgenic (Tg) mouse strain ectopically expressing DRAK2 via the lck proximal promoter (1017-DRAK2 Tg mice). This transgene led to highest expression levels in double-positive thymocytes that are normally devoid of DRAK2. 1017-DRAK2 Tg mice displayed a reduction of single-positive CD4(+) and CD8(+) thymocytes in context with diminished negative selection in male HY TCR Ã— 1017-DRAK2 Tg mice as well as peripheral T cell hypersensitivity, enhanced susceptibility to EAE and spontaneous autoimmunity. These findings suggest that alteration in thymocyte signaling thresholds impacts the sensitivity of peripheral T cell pools.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
