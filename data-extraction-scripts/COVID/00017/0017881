<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-11-01</DATELINE><TITLE>DOSE DEPENDENT LYMPHOCYTE APOPTOSIS FOLLOWING RESPIRATORY INFECTION WITH VACCINIA VIRUS</TITLE><BODY>Recently there has been renewed interest in poxvirus pathogenesis, especially with regard to infection via the respiratory route. Members of this family are known to produce a number of proteins that have the potential to negatively regulate the immune response. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used for a number of years as a model for the study of poxvirus infection. We have previously reported a dose dependent decrease in virus-specific CD8(+) T cells following respiratory infection with VACV. In this study we have evaluated whether more generalized immunosuppressive effects are also observed following infection with a high dose of VACV. We have found that mice infected intranasally with a high, but non-lethal, dose of VACV exhibited significant weight loss as well as decreased thymocyte number. Although these mice mounted an immune response, there was a significant increase observed in bystander T and B cell apoptosis. While increased death was apparent in both naïve and activated/memory T cells populations, naive T cells appeared more sensitive to this effect. These findings are important for our understanding of poxvirus regulation of the immune response and extends our previous understanding of VACV mediated immunosuppression to include generalized apoptosis in the naïve and activated/memory repertoires.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
