However, since most existing software tools rely on protein databases, their success is limited, especially as the pace of annotation efforts fails to keep pace with sequencing. We present a publicly available, web-based version of a software tool that maps peptide mass fingerprint data directly to their genomic origin, allowing for genome-based, annotation-independent protein identification.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
