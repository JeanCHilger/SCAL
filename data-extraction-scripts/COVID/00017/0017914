<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-02-15</DATELINE><TITLE>An Alternate Pathway for Recruiting Template RNA to the Brome Mosaic Virus RNA Replication Complex</TITLE><BODY>The multidomain RNA replication protein 1a of brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, plays key roles in assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex. 1a, which encodes RNA capping and helicase-like domains, localizes to endoplasmic reticulum membranes, recruits BMV 2a polymerase and viral RNA templates, and forms membrane-bound, capsid-like spherules in which RNA replication occurs. cis-acting signals necessary and sufficient for RNA recruitment by 1a have been mapped in BMV genomic RNA2 and RNA3. Both signals comprise an extended stem-loop whose apex matches the conserved sequence and structure of the TΨC stem-loop in tRNAs (box B). Mutations show that this box B motif is crucial to 1a responsiveness of wild-type RNA2 and RNA3. We report here that, unexpectedly, some chimeric mRNAs expressing the 2a polymerase open reading frame from RNA2 were recruited by 1a to the replication complex and served as templates for negative-strand RNA synthesis, despite lacking the normally essential, box B-containing 5′ signal. Further studies showed that this template recruitment required high-efficiency translation of the RNA templates. Moreover, multiple small frameshifting insertion or deletion mutations throughout the N-terminal region of the open reading frame inhibited this template recruitment, while an in-frame insertion did not. Providing 2a in trans did not restore template recruitment of RNAs with frameshift mutations. Only those deletions in the N-terminal region of 2a that abolished 2a interaction with 1a abolished template recruitment of the RNA. These and other results indicate that this alternate pathway for 1a-dependent RNA recruitment involves 1a interaction with the translating mRNA via the 1a-interactive N-terminal region of the nascent 2a polypeptide. Interaction with nascent 2a also may be involved in 1a recruitment of 2a polymerase to membranes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
