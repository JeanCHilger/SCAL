<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>ACE2-Independent Action Of Presumed ACE2 Activators: Studies In Vivo, Ex Vivo and In Vitro</TITLE><BODY>Angiotensin converting enzyme 2, (ACE2), is a key enzyme in the metabolism of angiotensin II. 1-[[2-(dimetilamino)ethyl]amino]-4-(hidroximetil)-7-[[(4-metilfenil)sulfonil]oxi]-9H-xantona-9 (XNT)and Diminazene (DIZE)have been reported to exert various organ-protective effects that have been attributed to activation of ACE2. To test the effect of these compounds we studied Ang II degradation in vivo and in vitro as well as their effect on ACE2 activity in vivo and in vitro. In a model of Ang II induced acute hypertension, blood pressure recovery was markedly enhanced by XNT (slope with XNT -3.26±0.2 vs.-1.6±0.2 mmHg/min without XNT, p<0.01). After Ang II infusion, neither plasma nor kidney ACE2 activity was affected by XNT. Plasma Ang II and Ang (1-7) levels also were not significantly affected by XNT. The blood pressure lowering effect of XNT seen in WT animals was also observed in ACE2 KO mice (slope with XNT -3.09±0.30 mmHg/min vs. -1.28±0.22 mmHg/min without XNT, p<0.001). These findings show that the blood pressure lowering effect of XNT in Ang II induced hypertension cannot be due to activation of ACE2. In vitro and ex vivo experiments in both mice and rat kidney confirmed a lack of enhancement of ACE2 enzymatic activity by XNT and DIZE. Moreover, Ang II degradation in vitro and ex vivo was unaffected by XNT and DIZE. We conclude that the biologic effects of these compounds are ACE2 independent and should not be attributed to activation of this enzyme.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
