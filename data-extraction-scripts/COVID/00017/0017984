<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-10-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Management of severe traumatic brain injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome using pumped extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal device</TITLE><BODY>The effects of a high carbon dioxide on cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure are well known. We report the case of a man who presented after with a severe traumatic brain injury including intracranial and extradural haemorrhage. Neuroprotective ventilation was impossible without supramaximal tidal volumes due to a combination of chest trauma and severe bronchospasm. A pump driven Novalung iLA activeÂ® system was inserted to achieve both ARDSnet ventilation and a lowering of intracranial pressure. To our knowledge, this is the first time this system has been used to this effect. The patient went on to make a good recovery.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
