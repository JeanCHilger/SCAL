Here, two Arabidopsis members of this family, AtUCP1 and AtUCP2, which were previously thought to be uncoupling proteins and hence named UCP1/PUMP1 and UCP2/PUMP2, respectively, are assigned with a novel function. They were expressed in bacteria, purified, and reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. Their transport properties demonstrate that they transport amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, cysteine sulfinate, and cysteate), dicarboxylates (malate, oxaloacetate, and 2-oxoglutarate), phosphate, sulfate, and thiosulfate. Transport was saturable and inhibited by mercurials and other mitochondrial carrier inhibitors to various degrees. AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 catalyzed a fast counterexchange transport as well as a low uniport of substrates, with transport rates of AtUCP1 being much higher than those of AtUCP2 in both cases. The aspartate/glutamate heteroexchange mediated by AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 is electroneutral, in contrast to that mediated by the mammalian mitochondrial aspartate glutamate carrier. Furthermore, both carriers were found to be targeted to mitochondria. Metabolite profiling of single and double knockouts shows changes in organic acid and amino acid levels. Notably, AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 are the first reported mitochondrial carriers in Arabidopsis to transport aspartate and glutamate. It is proposed that the primary function of AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 is to catalyze an aspartate(out)/glutamate(in) exchange across the mitochondrial membrane and thereby contribute to the export of reducing equivalents from the mitochondria in photorespiration.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
