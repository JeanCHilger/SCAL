Despite the burden of RSV-associated disease, treatments and preventative measures are limited. In this issue of JCI, Bird and colleagues describe their work using a peptide stapling technique that allowed synthesis of a stable peptide mimic of a portion of the RSV fusion protein. Pretreatment of cells with the stable peptide effectively blocked virus entry. When introduced into mice prior to RSV exposure, the peptide produced a substantial prophylactic effect. This work provides a new way forward in RSV prevention.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
