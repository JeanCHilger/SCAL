MRP8/MRP14 is an endogenous DAMP involved in various inflammatory diseases, though its mechanism of action is unclear. Circulating MRP8/MRP14 levels in human blunt trauma nonsurvivors were significantly lower than those of survivors (P < 0.001). Human monocytic THP-1 cells stimulated with MRP8/MRP14 expressed the chemokine IFN-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10)/CXCL10. Circulating IP-10 levels in human blunt trauma patients were correlated positively with MRP8/MRP14 levels (r = 0.396, P < 0.001), and were significantly lower in trauma nonsurvivors than in survivors (P < 0.001). We therefore sought to determine the mechanisms by which MRP8/MRP14 stimulates IP-10 in monocytes/macrophages, and found that induction of IP-10 by MRP8/MRP14 required Toll-like receptor 4 and TRIF but not MyD88. Full induction of IP-10 by MRP8/MRP14 required synergy between the transcription factors NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The receptor for IP-10 is CXCR3, and MRP8/MRP14-induced chemotaxis of CXCR3(+) cells was dependent on the production of IP-10 in monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, in vivo study with a mouse trauma/hemorrhagic shock model showed that administration of neutralizing antibody against MRP8 prevented activation of NF-κB and IRF3 as well as IP-10 production. Thus, the current study identified a novel signaling mechanism that controls IP-10 expression in monocytes/macrophages by MRP8/MRP14, which may play an important role in injury-induced inflammation.—Wang, J., Vodovotz, Y., Fan, L., Li, Y., Liu, Z., Namas, R., Barclay, D., Zamora, R., Billiar, T.
