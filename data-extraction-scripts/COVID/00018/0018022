<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-10-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Widespread but tissue-specific patterns of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3, FRAGILIS, MIL-1) in the mouse gastrula</TITLE><BODY>Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3; FRAGILIS; MIL-1) is part of a larger family of important small interferon-induced transmembrane genes and proteins involved in early development, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation, and which also play a major role in response to bacterial and viral infections and, more recently, in pronounced malignancies (Siegrist et al., 2011). IFITM3, together with tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), PRDM1, and STELLA, has been claimed to be a hallmark of segregated primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Saitou et al., 2002). However, whether IFITM3, like STELLA, is part of a broader stem/progenitor pool that builds the posterior region of the mouse conceptus (Mikedis and Downs, 2012), is obscure. To discover the whereabouts of IFITM3 during mouse gastrulation (~E6.5-9.0), systematic immunohistochemical analysis was carried out at closely spaced 2-4-hour intervals. Results revealed diverse, yet consistent, profiles of IFITM3 localization throughout the gastrula. Within the putative PGC trajectory and surrounding posterior tissues, IFITM3 localized as a large cytoplasmic spot with or without staining in the plasma membrane. IFITM3, like STELLA, was also found in the ventral ectodermal ridge (VER), a posterior progenitor pool that builds the tailbud. The large cytoplasmic spot with plasma membrane staining was exclusive to the posterior region; the visceral yolk sac, non-posterior tissues, and epithelial tissues exhibited spots of IFITM3 without cell surface staining. Co-localization of the intracellular IFITM3 spot with the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus or endolysosomes was not observed. That relatively high levels of IFITM3 were found throughout the posterior primitive streak and its derivatives is consistent with evidence that IFITM3, like STELLA, is part of a larger stem/progenitor cell pool at the posterior end of the primitive streak that forms the base of the allantois and builds the fetal-umbilical connection, thus further obfuscating practical phenotypic distinctions between so-called PGCs and surrounding soma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
