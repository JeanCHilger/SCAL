To investigate how mutations that alter the activation pH of the HA protein influence the fitness of an avian H5N1 influenza virus in a mammalian model, we infected C57BL/6J or DBA/2J mice and compared the replication and virulence of recombinant A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (H5N1) HA-Y23(1)H mutant, wild-type, and HA-H24(1)Q and HA-K58(2)I mutant viruses that have HA activation pH values of 6.3, 5.9, 5.6, and 5.4, respectively. The HA-Y23(1)H mutant virus was highly susceptible to acid inactivation in vitro and was attenuated for growth and virulence in mice, suggesting that an H5N1 HA protein triggered at pH 6.3 is too unstable for the virus to remain fit. Wild-type and HA-H24(1)Q viruses were similar in pathogenicity and grew to similar levels in mice, ducks, and cell cultures derived from both avian and mammalian tissues, suggesting that H5N1 HA proteins triggered at pH values in the range of 5.9 to 5.6 broadly support replication. The HA-K58(2)I mutant virus had greater growth and virulence in DBA/2J mice than the wild type did, although the mutant virus was highly attenuated in ducks. The data suggest that adaptation of avian H5N1 influenza virus for infection in mammals is supported by a decrease in the HA activation pH to 5.4. Identification of the HA activation pH as a host-specific infectivity factor is expected to aid in the surveillance and risk assessment of currently circulating H5N1 influenza viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
