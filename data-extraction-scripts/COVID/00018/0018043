A common mechanism used by many is to transcribe viral subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. Transcription of sg mRNA2 in tombusviruses allows for expression of the p19 suppressor of gene silencing and p22 movement proteins. We have investigated the mechanism of transcription of this sg mRNA in Tomato bushy stunt virus and have determined that this process is facilitated by no less than three different RNA modules that are located throughout the viral genome. These RNA units perform distinct tasks and function via long-distance RNA–RNA interactions. Systematic deconstruction of the RNA network and analysis of related RNA promoter elements allowed us to identify fundamental properties necessary for productive sg mRNA2 transcription. Collectively, our results (i) establish specific roles for the different RNA components of a multipartite RNA-based control system, (ii) support a premature termination mechanism for tombusvirus sg mRNA transcription and (iii) reveal a close mechanistic relationship between sg mRNA transcription, viral RNA replication and RNA recombination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
