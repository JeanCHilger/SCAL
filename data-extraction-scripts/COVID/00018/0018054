However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for immune control of their replication are not completely understood. Here we report that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is required for control of murine NV (MNV) replication and pathogenesis in vivo. This led us to studies documenting a cell-autonomous role for IRF-1 in gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in primary macrophages. This role of IRF-1 in the inhibition of MNV replication by IFN-γ is independent of IFN-αβ signaling. While the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT-1 was also required for IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in vitro, class II transactivator (CIITA), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) were not required. We therefore hypothesized that there must be a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) regulated by IFN-γ in a manner dependent only on STAT-1 and IRF-1. Analysis of transcriptional profiles of macrophages lacking various transcription factors confirmed this hypothesis. These studies identify a key role for IRF-1 in IFN-γ-dependent control of norovirus infection in mice and macrophages.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
