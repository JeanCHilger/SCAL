However, subjective sensation of nasal patency may be more associated with activation of cold receptors by inspired air than with respiratory effort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether subjective nasal patency correlates with nasal mucosal temperature in healthy subjects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two healthy adults were recruited for this study. Subjects first completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and a unilateral visual analog scale (VAS) to quantify subjective nasal patency. A miniaturized thermocouple sensor was then used to record nasal mucosal temperature bilaterally in two locations along the nasal septum: at the vestibule and across from the inferior turbinate head. RESULTS: The range of temperature oscillations during the breathing cycle, defined as the difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory temperatures, was greater during deep breaths (ΔT(exp-insp) = 6.2 ± 2.6°C) than during resting breathing (ΔT(exp-insp) = 4.2 ± 2.3°C) in both locations (p < 10(−13)). Mucosal temperature measured at the right vestibule had a statistically significant correlation with both right-side VAS score (Pearson r = −0.55, p=0.0076) and NOSE score (Pearson r = −0.47, p=0.028). No other statistically significant correlations were found between mucosal temperature and subjective nasal patency scores. Nasal mucosal temperature was lower in the first cavity to be measured, which was the right cavity in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The greater mucosal temperature oscillations during deep breathing is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation. A possible correlation was found between subjective nasal patency scores and nasal mucosal temperature, but our results were inconsistent. The higher temperature in the left cavity suggests that the sensor irritated the nasal mucosa, affecting the correlation between patency scores and mucosal temperature. Future studies should consider non-contact temperature sensors to prevent mucosa irritation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
