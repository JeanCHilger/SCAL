We investigated the kinetic, structural, and functional advantage conferred by individual naturally-occurring somatic mutations in the antibody heavy chain variable region of Fab19, a well-described neutralizing human monoclonal antibody directed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Comparison of the affinity-matured antibody Fab19 with recombinant Fab19 antibodies that were variants containing reverted amino acids from the inferred unmutated ancestor sequence revealed the molecular basis for affinity maturation of this antibody. Enhanced binding was achieved through mutations in the third heavy chain complementary determining region (HCDR3) that conferred a markedly faster on-rate and a desirable increase in antiviral neutralizing activity. In contrast, most somatic mutations in the HCDR1 and HCDR2 regions did not significantly enhance antigen binding or antiviral activity. We observed a direct relationship between the measured association rate (K(on)) for F protein and antiviral activity. Modeling studies of the structure of the antigen-antibody complex suggested the HCDR3 loop interacts with the antigenic site A surface loop of the RSV F protein, previously shown to contain the epitope for this antibody by experimentation. These studies define a direct relationship of affinity and neutralizing activity for a viral glycoprotein-specific human monoclonal antibody.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
