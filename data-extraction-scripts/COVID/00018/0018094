AIMS: This study explored whether the ACE2/Ang‐(1‐7)/Mas pathway has a protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury and whether this effect is affected by age. METHODS: We used three‐month and eight‐month transgenic mice with neural over‐expression of ACE2 (SA) and their age‐matched nontransgenic (NT) controls. Neurological deficits and ischemic stroke volume were determined following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) experiments on brain slices, the effects of the Mas receptor agonist (Ang1‐7) or antagonist (A779) on tissue swelling, Nox2/Nox4 expression reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death were measured. RESULTS: (1) Middle cerebral artery occlusion ‐induced ischemic injury and neurological deficit were reduced in SA mice, especially in eight‐month animals; (2) OGD‐induced tissue swelling and cell death were decreased in SA mice with a greater reduction seen in eight‐month mice; (3) Ang‐(1–7) and A779 had opposite effects on OGD‐induced responses, which correlated with changes in Nox2/Nox4 expression and ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2/Ang‐(1‐7)/Mas axis protects brain from ischemic injury via the Nox/ROS signaling pathway, with a greater effect in older animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
