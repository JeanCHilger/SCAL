We found that the CMV replicase had different fidelity in different environments, with important implications in viral disease evolution. Insertions were very rare events, irrespective of the region of the satRNA genome assayed and independent of the hosts tested. On the other hand, deletion events were more frequent but were restricted to a highly structured region of the reporter. Deletion mutation rates were different for the two hosts tested, although the mutation distribution was not influenced by the hosts. Moreover, hot spots with high mutation rates were identified on the satRNA genome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
