Whether additional cellular mediators are involved in this suppression remains to be determined. In this study, we report on the requirement of cellular double-stranded RNA-binding protein PACT for Us11-mediated perturbation of type I interferon production. Us11 associates with PACT tightly to prevent it from binding with and activating RIG-I. The Us11-deficient HSV-1 was indistinguishable from the Us11-proficient virus in the suppression of interferon production when PACT was compromised. More importantly, HSV-1-induced activation of interferon production was abrogated in PACT knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for viral evasion of innate immunity through which a viral double-stranded RNA-binding protein interacts with PACT to circumvent type I interferon production. This mechanism might also be used by other PACT-binding viral interferon-antagonizing proteins such as Ebola virus VP35 and influenza A virus NS1.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
