Overall, 31.3% of the specimens tested positive for an RV. In 19 sets (26.4%), the NP and BAL fluid specimens were both positive for an RV; in 3 sets (4.2%), the NP specimens were positive but the BAL fluid specimens were negative; and in 3 other sets, the NP specimens were negative but the BAL fluid specimens were positive. The positive and negative predictive values of the NP specimens were 86.4% and 94%, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
