In this study, we initially compared the protective immune responses elicited following immunization with recombinant Bm-ALT-2 protein regimen and Bm-alt-2 DNA regimen. These studies showed that protein vaccination conferred approximately 75% protection compared to DNA vaccination that conferred only 57% protection. Analysis of the protective immune responses showed that the protein immunization promoted a Th2-biased response with an increase in IL-4, IL-5 and IgG1 responses, whereas, the DNA vaccine promoted a Th1-biased response with profound IFN-Î³ and IgG2a responses. Since protein vaccination gave better results than DNA vaccination, we then wanted to evaluate whether a prime-boost vaccination that combined DNA prime and protein boost will significantly increase the protective responses induced by the protein vaccine. Our results suggest that prime-boost vaccination had no added advantage and was comparatively less effective (64% protection) than the Bm-ALT-2 protein alone vaccination. Prime boost vaccination generated mixed Th1/Th2 responses with a slightly diminished Th2 responses compared to protein vaccination. Thus, our results suggest that Bm-ALT-2 protein vaccination regimen may be slightly better than prime-boost vaccine regimen and the mechanism of protection appears to be largely mediated by a Th2-biased response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
