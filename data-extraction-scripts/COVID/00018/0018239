<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Development of Gastrointestinal Function: Risk Factors for Necrotizing Enterocolitis</TITLE><BODY>The intestinal tract of the fetus matures rapidly in the third trimester of the pregnancy. The premature infant has decreased intestinal motility, limited digestion, absorption and excretion, and poor intestinal barrier defense. These limitations place the infant at high risk for acute intestinal injury, necrotizing enterocolitis.
