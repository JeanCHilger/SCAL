<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The “Contaminating Agent” UNRRA, Displaced Persons, and Venereal Disease in Germany, 1945–1947</TITLE><BODY>World War II created a large group of persecuted, homeless or stateless people who came to be united under the term “displaced persons” (DPs). The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was charged with the care of these individuals in various camps in Germany, although the military governments of the respective zones of occupation had ultimate authority over them. Among the various public health efforts directed toward DPs was a campaign against venereal disease during which compulsory examinations were particularly stressed by the military governments. The controversy resulting from this campaign opens a new window on the complex context of an international organization working under the roof of a national authority to achieve common—or differing—public health goals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
