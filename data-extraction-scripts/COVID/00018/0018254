In this report, we show that the essential IFN-β transcription factors NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 are not activated for nuclear translocation and gene induction during infection. However, MHV was unable to inhibit the activation of these factors and subsequent IFN-β production induced by poly(I:C). Further, MHV infection did not inhibit IFN-β production mediated by known host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (RIG-I, Mda-5, and TLR3). These results are consistent with the notion that double-stranded RNA, produced during MHV infection, is not accessible to cellular PRRs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
