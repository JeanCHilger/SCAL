Studies in animal models have been invaluable for demonstrating the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of broadly neutralising antibodies, for comparisons with antiviral drugs used as the standard of care, and for defining their mechanism of action and potential role in providing protection from airborne infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
