To comprehensively identify human proteins whose interaction is modulated by SUMOylation, we developed an in vitro binding assay using human proteome microarrays to identify targets of SUMO1 and SUMO2. We then integrated these results with protein SUMOylation and protein-protein interaction data to perform network motif analysis. We focused on a single network motif we termed a SUMOmodPPI (SUMO-modulated Protein-Protein Interaction) that included the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex subunits TFPT and INO80E. We validated the SUMO-binding activity of INO80E, and showed that TFPT is a SUMO substrate both in vitro and in vivo. We then demonstrated a key role for SUMOylation in mediating the interaction between these two proteins, both in vitro and in vivo. By demonstrating a key role for SUMOylation in regulating the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, this work illustrates the power of bioinformatics analysis of large data sets in predicting novel biological phenomena.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
