Type I IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines with antiviral activity that also enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Viruses trigger activation of pDCss and type I IFN responses mainly through the Toll-like receptor pathway. However, a variety of activating and inhibitory pDCs receptors fine tune the amplitude of type I IFN responses. Chronic activation and secretion of type I IFN in the absence of infection can promote autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, while activated pDCss promote immunity and autoimmunity, resting or alternatively activated pDCss may be tolerogenic. The various roles of pDCss have been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo with depleting antibodies. However, depleting antibodies cross-react with other cell types that are critical for eliciting protective immunity, potentially yielding ambiguous phenotypes. Here we discuss new approaches to assess pDCs functions in vivo and provide preliminary data on their potential roles during viral infections. Such approaches would also prove useful in the more specific evaluation of how pDCss mediate tolerance and autoimmunity. Finally, we discuss the emergent role of pDCss and one of their receptors, tetherin, in human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
