We conducted a retrospective case-control study to identify risk factors for H5N1 disease in China. METHODS: A questionnaire about potential H5N1 exposures was administered to 28 H5N1 cases and 134 randomly selected age, gender, and location matched controls or proxies. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Before their illness, urban cases had visited wet poultry markets while rural cases had exposure to sick or dead backyard poultry. Independent H5N1 risk factors in multivariable analyses were direct contact with sick or dead poultry (OR 506.6; 95% CI 15.7–16319.6; p=0.0004), indirect exposure to sick or dead poultry (OR 56.9; 95% CI 4.3–745.6; p=0.002), and visiting a wet poultry market (OR 15.4; 95% CI 3.0–80.2; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To prevent human H5N1 cases in China, education to avoid direct or close exposures to sick or dead poultry should be increased, and interventions to prevent the spread of H5N1 at live poultry markets should be implemented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
