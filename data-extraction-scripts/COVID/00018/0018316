<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-08-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete Genome Sequence of a Highly Prevalent Isolate of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in South China</TITLE><BODY>A widespread porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) occurred in southern China during 2010 to 2012. A virulent field PEDV strain, GD-B, was isolated from a sucking piglet suffering from severe diarrhea in Guangdong, China. We sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of strain GD-B, which will promote a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates in southern China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
