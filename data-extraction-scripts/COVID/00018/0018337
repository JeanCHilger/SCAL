These findings are illustrated by the recent discovery of host-encoded factors that restrict HCV infection. In this review, we briefly discuss these restriction factors in different steps of HCV infection. In each case, we discuss how these restriction factors were identified, the mechanisms by which they inhibit HCV infection and their potential contribution to viral pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
