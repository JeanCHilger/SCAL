We also show directly that cross-reactive T-cells mediate protective heterologous immunity in mice. Subsets of T-cell populations reactive with one epitope cross-reacted with either of several other epitopes encoded by the same or the heterologous virus. Human T-cells specific to EBV-encoded BMLF1(280-288) could be cross-reactive with two IAV or two other EBV epitopes. Mouse T-cells specific to the VV-encoded a11r(198-205) could be cross-reactive with three different LCMV, one Pichinde virus, or one other VV epitope. Patterns of cross-reactivity differed among individuals, reflecting the private specificities of the hostâ€™s immune repertoire, and divergence in the abilities of T-cell populations to mediate protective immunity. Defining such cross-reactive networks between commonly encountered human pathogens may facilitate the design of vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
