Here, we report that murine IFITM1 (mIFITM1) is palmitoylated on one nonconserved cysteine and three conserved cysteines that are required for anti-influenza A virus activity. Additionally, palmitoylation of mIFITM1 regulates protein stability by preventing proteasomal degradation, and modification of the nonconserved cysteine at the mIFITM1 C terminus supports an intramembrane topology with mechanistic implications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
