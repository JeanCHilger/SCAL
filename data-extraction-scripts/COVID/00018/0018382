Type I IFNs produced by the infected tissue also signal beyond the boundaries of the infection to regulate different elements of the anti-viral immune response. Recent reports show that type I IFNs directly condition naive monocytes residing in the distal bone marrow and induce the expression of effector molecules in memory T cells, prior to their recruitment to the infected site. In addition, hematopoietic stem cells were shown to enter the cell cycle in response to systemic type I IFNs. These discoveries expand our understanding of the pleiotropic effects of type I IFNs during infection and highlight the involvement of the whole organism in the development of an effective response to a localized viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
