<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-06-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterization of Two Human Monoclonal Antibodies Neutralizing Influenza A H7N9 Viruses</TITLE><BODY>H7N9 was a cause of significant global health concern due to its severe infection and approximately 35% mortality in humans. By screening a Fab antibody phage library derived from patients who recovered from H7N9 infections, we characterized two human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs), HNIgGD5 and HNIgGH8. The epitope of these two antibodies was dependent on two residues in the receptor binding site at positions V186 and L226 of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein. Both antibodies possessed high neutralizing activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
