Low-neurovirulence TMEV result in a persistent central nervous system infection in mice, leading to an inflammatory demyelinating pathology and disease. Low- but not high-neurovirulence strains use sialic acid as an attachment factor. The recent resolution of the crystal structure of the low-neurovirulence DA virus in complex with the sialic acid mimic sialyllactose demonstrated that four capsid residues make contact with sialic acid through noncovalent hydrogen bonds. To systematically test the importance of these sialic acid-binding residues in viral entry and infection, we mutated three VP2 puff B amino acids proposed to make contact with sialic acid and analyzed the consequences of each amino acid substitution on viral entry and spread. The fourth residue is in the VP3-VP1 cleavage dipeptide and could not be mutated. Our data suggest that residues Q2161 and G2174 are directly involved in BeAn virus attachment to sialic acid and that substitutions of these two residues result in the loss of or reduced viral binding and hemagglutination and in the inability to spread among BHK-21 cells. In addition, a gain of function-revertant virus was recovered with the Q2161A mutation after prolonged passage in cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
