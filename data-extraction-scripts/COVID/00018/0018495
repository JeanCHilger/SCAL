CCR4 is also highly expressed on T-regulatory cells (Tregs) that can migrate to several different types of chemotactic ligand CCL17 and CCL22 secreting tumors to facilitate tumor cell evasion from immune surveillance. Thus, its high level expression on CTCL cells and Tregs makes CCR4 a potential ideal target for antibody-based immunotherapy for CTCL and other types of solid tumors. Here we performed humanization and affinity optimization of a murine anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), mAb1567, that recognizes both the N-terminal and extracellular domains of CCR4 with high affinity and inhibits chemotaxis of CCR4(+) CTCL cells. In a mouse CTCL tumor model, mAb1567 exhibited a potent anti-tumor effect and in vitro mechanistic studies showed that both complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and neutrophil-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) likely mediated this effect. MAb1567 also exerts human NK cell-mediated ADCC activity in vitro. Moreover, mAb1567 also effectively inhibits chemotaxis of CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs via CCL22 and abrogates Treg suppression activity in vitro. An affinity optimized variant of humanized mAb1567, mAb2-3, was selected for further preclinical development based on its higher binding affinity and more potent ADCC and CDC activities. Taken together, this high affinity humanized mAb2-3 with potent anti-tumor effect and a broad range of mechanisms of action may provide a novel immunotherapy for CTCL and other solid tumors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
