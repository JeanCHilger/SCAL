CEACAM1 expression correlated with granulocytic differentiation, and Ceacam1(−/−) mice developed neutrophilia due to loss of the Src- homology-phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) dependent inhibition of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3) pathway provided by CEACAM1. Moreover, Ceacam1(−/−) mice were hypersensitive to Listeria Monocytogenes (LM) infection with an accelerated mortality. Reintroduction of CEACAM1 into Ceacam1(−/−) bone marrow restored normal granulopoiesis and host sensitivity to LM infection, while mutation of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) abrogated this restoration. shRNA mediated reduction of Stat3 amounts rescued normal granulopoiesis attenuating host sensitivity to LM infection in Ceacam1(−/−) mice. Thus, CEACAM1 acted as a co-inhibitory receptor for G-CSFR regulating granulopoiesis and host innate immune response to bacterial infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
