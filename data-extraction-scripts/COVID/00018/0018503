Here, we design genetically encoded antibody-like ligands (intrabodies) that recognize active, GTP-bound K- and H-Ras. These ligands, which use the 10th domain of human fibronectin as their scaffold, are stable inside the cells and when fused with a fluorescent protein label, the constitutively active G12V mutant H-Ras. Primary selection of ligands against Ras with mRNA display resulted in an intrabody (termed RasIn1) that binds with a K(D) of 2.1 Î¼M to H-Ras(G12V) (GTP), excellent state selectivity, and remarkable specificity for K- and H-Ras. RasIn1 recognizes residues in the Switch I region of Ras, similar to Raf-RBD, and competes with Raf-RBD for binding. An affinity maturation selection based on RasIn1 resulted in RasIn2, which binds with a K(D) of 120 nM and also retains excellent state selectivity. Both of these intrabodies colocalize with H-Ras, K-Ras, and G12V mutants inside the cells, providing new potential tools to monitor and modulate Ras-mediated signaling. Finally, RasIn1 and Rasin2 both display selectivity for the G12V mutants as compared with wild-type Ras providing a potential route for mutant selective recognition of Ras.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
