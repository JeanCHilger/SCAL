The pathway is initiated by soluble pattern recognition molecules: mannan-binding lectin (MBL), M-, L- and H-ficolin and collectin-liver-1 (CL-L1), which are predominantly synthesised in the liver. AIM: We aimed to study lectin levels in ALF patients and associations with clinical outcome. METHODS: Serum samples from 75 patients enrolled by the U.S. ALF Study Group were collected on days 1 and 3. We included 75 healthy blood donors and 20 cirrhosis patients as controls. Analyses were performed using sandwich-type immunoassays (ELISA, TRIFMA). RESULTS: At day 1, the MBL level in ALF patients was 40% lower compared with healthy controls ((median(interquartile range) 0.72 μg/ml(0.91) vs. 1.15(1.92)(p=0.02)), and increased significantly by day 3 (0.83 μg/ml(0.94)(p=0.01)). The M-ficolin level was 60% lower (0.54 μg/ml(0.50) vs. 1.48(1.01)(p<0.0001)). The CL-L1 level at day 1 was slightly higher compared with healthy controls (3.20 μg/ml(2.37) vs. 2.64(0.72)(p=0.11)); this was significant at day 3 (3.35(1.84)(p=0.006)). H- and L-ficolin levels were similar to healthy controls. Spontaneous ALF survivors had higher levels of MBL at day 1 (0.96 μg/ml(1.15) vs. 0.60(0.60)(p=0.02)) and lower levels of L-ficolin by day 3 compared with patients who died or were transplanted (1.61 μg/ml(1.19) vs. 2.17(2.19)(p=0.02)). CONCLUSION: We observed significant dynamics in lectin levels in ALF patients, which may suggest they play a role in ALF pathogenesis. High MBL and low L-ficolin levels are associated with survival.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
