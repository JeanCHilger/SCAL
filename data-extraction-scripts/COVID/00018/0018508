Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) are a new class of drugs designed to induce therapeutically favorable splice variants of targeted genes. In this work, we used locked nucleic acid (LNA)–based SSOs to modulate splicing of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) pre-mRNA. The SSO induced skipping of TNFR2 exon 7, which codes the transmembrane domain (TM), switching endogenous expression from the membrane-bound, functional form to a soluble, secreted form (Δ7TNFR2). This decoy receptor protein accumulated in the circulation of treated mice, antagonized TNF-α, and altered disease in two mouse models: TNF-α-induced hepatitis and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). This is the first report of upregulation of the endogenous, circulating TNF-α antagonist by oligonucleotide-induced splicing modulation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
