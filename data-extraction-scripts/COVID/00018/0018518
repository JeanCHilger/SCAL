A simple integrated MCE-CL system was built to perform the assays. The highly sensitive CL detection was achieved by means of the CL reaction between hydrogen peroxide and N-(4-aminobutyl)- N-ethylisoluminol-tagged peptides in the presence of adenine as a CL enhancer and Co(2+) as a catalyst. Experimental conditions for analyte labeling, MCE separation, and CL detection were studied. MCE separation of the above said three peptides took less than 120 s. Detection limits (S/N=3) of 3.0×10(−8), 2.8×10(−8) and 3.4×10(−8) M were obtained for carnosine, anserine and homocarnosine, respectively. The present MCE-CL method was applied for the determination of carnosine, anserine and homocarnosine in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and canine plasma. Homocarnosine was detected at the µM level in the CSF samples analyzed while the levels of carnosine and anserine in these samples were below the detection limit of the assay. Interestingly, both carnosine and anserine were detected in the canine plasma samples, but not homocarnosine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
