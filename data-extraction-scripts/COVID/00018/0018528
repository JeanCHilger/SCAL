<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-10-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Modern Uses of Electron Microscopy for Detection of Viruses</TITLE><BODY>Summary: Electron microscopy, considered by some to be an old technique, is still on the forefront of both clinical viral diagnoses and viral ultrastructure and pathogenesis studies. In the diagnostic setting, it is particularly valuable in the surveillance of emerging diseases and potential bioterrorism viruses. In the research arena, modalities such as immunoelectron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and electron tomography have demonstrated how viral structural components fit together, attach to cells, assimilate during replication, and associate with the cellular machinery during replication and egression. These studies provide information for treatment and vaccine strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
