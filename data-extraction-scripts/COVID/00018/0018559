<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-02-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Ethical planning for an influenza pandemic</TITLE><BODY>A UK Pandemic Influenza Contingency Plan was developed in 2006 but little research has since been carried out as to how ethically acceptable it will be to society. A survey containing two hypothetical scenarios was distributed to 1,018 hospital staff. The survey considered their attitudes to the professional and ethical responsibilities of healthcare workers, and to resource allocation on the intensive care unit (ICU). Of those distributed, 406 (40%) surveys were returned. During a pandemic, 320 (79%) healthcare professionals would continue to work and 339 (83%) felt it would be unprofessional for doctors to leave work. Only 218 (54%) chose the same patient for the last ICU bed. Most staff surveyed felt they should (professionally) and would (voluntarily) work during a pandemic despite high personal risk. A wide diversity of opinion existed regarding resource allocation of ICU beds. These ethical issues require open debate to ensure UK pandemic plans are ethically acceptable and practically applicable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
