<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-06-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor is the cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus gHgLgO trimer</TITLE><BODY>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes at least 25 membrane glycoproteins that are found in the viral envelope(1). While gB represents the fusion protein, two glycoprotein complexes control the tropism of the virus: the gHgLgO trimer is involved in the infection of fibroblasts, while the gHgLpUL128L pentamer is required for infection of endothelial, epithelial and myeloid cells(2–5). Two reports suggested that gB binds to ErbB1 and PDGFRα(6,7), however these results do not explain the tropism of the virus and were recently challenged(8,9). Here we provide a 19Å reconstruction for the gHgLgO trimer and show that it binds with high affinity through the gO subunit to PDGFRα, which is expressed on fibroblasts but not on epithelial cells. We also provide evidences that the trimer is essential for viral entry in all cell types. Furthermore, we identified the pentamer as a trigger for the ErbB pathway, which is essential for infection of epithelial cells. These findings help explain the broad tropism of HCMV and indicate that PDGFRα and the viral gO subunit could be targeted by novel anti-viral therapies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
