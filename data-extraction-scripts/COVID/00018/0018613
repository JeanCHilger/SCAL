RECENT FINDINGS: The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R)-associated factor (TRAF) family of cytoplasmic proteins was initially identified as signaling adaptors that bind directly to the intracellular domains of receptors of the TNF-R superfamily. It is now appreciated that TRAF molecules are widely employed in signaling by a variety of adaptive and innate immune receptors as well as cytokine receptors. TRAF-dependent signaling pathways typically lead to the activation of nuclear factor-κBs (NF-κBs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), or interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs). Most of these signaling pathways have been linked to inflammation, and therefore TRAF molecules were expected to regulate inflammation and inflammatory responses since their discovery in 1990s. However, direct in vivo evidence of TRAFs in inflammation and especially in inflammatory diseases had been lacking for many years, partly due to the difficulty imposed by early lethality of TRAF2(−/−), TRAF3(−/−), and TRAF6(−/−) mice. With the creation of conditional knockout and lineage-specific transgenic mice of different TRAF molecules, our understanding about TRAFs in inflammation and inflammatory responses has rapidly advanced during the past decade. SUMMARY: Increasing evidence indicates that TRAF molecules are versatile and indispensable regulators of inflammation and inflammatory responses and that aberrant expression or function of TRAFs contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
