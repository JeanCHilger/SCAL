<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1995-09-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The N-terminal hydrophobic region of the mature phosphate translocator is sufficient for targeting to the chloroplast inner envelope membrane.</TITLE><BODY>To locate the sequence required for directing the phosphate translocator to the chloroplast inner envelope membrane, a series of chimeric proteins constituting parts of the phosphate translocator and the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, which is normally located in the stroma, has been produced. Reciprocal exchanges of the presequences and mature sequences of the phosphate translocator and the small subunit indicated that the phosphate translocator presequence contains stromal targeting information and that the mature protein is responsible for inner envelope membrane targeting. Chimeric proteins containing the N-terminal 46 amino acid residues of the phosphate translocator were directed to the inner envelope membrane. Subdivision of this region into its composite hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions showed that the hydrophobic region alone, which consists of amino acid residues 24 to 45, was able to direct the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase to the inner envelope membrane.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
