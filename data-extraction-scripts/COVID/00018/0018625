<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-09-05</DATELINE><TITLE>A Recap of RNA Recapping</TITLE><BODY>The N7-methylguanosine cap is a hallmark of the 5â€² end of eukaryotic mRNAs and is required for gene expression. Loss of the cap was believed to lead irreversibly to decay. However, nearly a decade ago it was discovered that mammalian cells contain enzymes in the cytoplasm that are capable of restoring caps onto uncapped RNAs. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of cytoplasmic RNA recapping and discuss the biochemistry of this process and its impact on regulating and diversifying the transcriptome. Although most studies focus on mammalian RNA recapping, we also highlight new observations for recapping in disparate eukaryotic organisms, with the trypanosome recapping system appearing to be a fascinating example of convergent evolution. We conclude with emerging insights into the biological significance of RNA recapping and prospects for the future of this evolving area of study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
