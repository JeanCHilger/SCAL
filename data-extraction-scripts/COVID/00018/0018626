STUDY DESIGN: 2782 infants, between 1996–2004, weighing 401–1500 grams at birth were included. NEC was defined as Bell stage II or III. Two statistical methods used to define “disease clusters” were: (1) modified scan test; (2) comparison of observed and expected incidence density rates (IDR) of NEC at each NICU. RESULTS: The proportion of infants with NEC was similar between NICUs (7.1% vs. 7.7%; p=0.6) as was the expected IDR of NEC (1.39/1000 patient-days vs. 1.32/1000 patient-days, p=0.72). Twelve temporal clusters of NEC were identified in the NICUs combined, comprising 18% of 203 total NEC cases during the study period. No seasonal/secular trends were noted for NEC rates or identified clusters. Potential NEC clusters of ≥3 cases at either NICU had >75% chance of being a true NEC cluster. CONCLUSIONS: No operational definition of NEC cluster exists. This study introduced methods to be employed for prospective surveillance and guide studies to investigate etiologic relevance. Utilizing the proposed methods, statistically significant clusters (potential outbreaks) of NEC within NICUs can be identified early, providing early opportunity to implement cluster investigation protocols.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
