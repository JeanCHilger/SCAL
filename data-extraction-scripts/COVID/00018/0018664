METHODS: AF samples obtained from 59 women with preterm PROM were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as genital mycoplasmas) and with broad-range polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). AF concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was determined using ELISA. Results of both tests were correlated with AF IL-6 concentrations, and the occurrence of adverse obstetrical/perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: 1) PCR/ESI-MS, AF culture, and the combination of these two tests, each identified microorganisms in 36% (21/59), 24% (14/59) and 41% (24/59) of women with preterm PROM, respectively; 2) the most frequent microorganisms found in the amniotic cavity were Sneathia species and Ureaplasma urealyticum; 3) the frequency of microbial-associated and sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was overall similar [ 29% (17/59)]: - however, the prevalence of each differed according to the gestational age when PROM occurred ; 4) the earlier the gestational age at preterm PROM, the higher the frequency of both microbial-associated and sterile intra-amniotic inflammation; 5) the intensity of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response against microorganisms is stronger when preterm PROM occurs early in pregnancy; and 6) the frequency of acute placental inflammation (histologic chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis) was significantly higher in patients with microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation [93.3% (14/15) vs. 38% (6/16); p=0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The frequency of microorganisms in preterm PROM is 40% using both cultivation and PCR/ESI-MS; 2) PCR/ESI-MS identified microorganisms in the AF of 50% more women with preterm PROM than did AF culture; and 3) sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was present in 29% of these patients, and it was as or more common than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation among those presenting after, but not before, 24 weeks of gestation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
