They are composed of an Fv that targets a cancer antigen and a fragment of a bacterial toxin that kills tumor cells. Because the toxin is a foreign protein, it is immunogenic. The clinical success of RITs in patients with a normal immune system is limited by their immunogenicity. In this review, we discuss our progress in therapeutic protein deimmunization and the balancing act between immunogenicity and therapeutic potency. One approach is to prevent the activation of B cells by mapping and elimination of B-cell epitopes. A second approach is to prevent helper T-cell activation by interfering with major histocompatibility complex II presentation or T-cell recognition. Immunizing mice with RITs that were deimmunized by elimination of the murine B- or T-cell epitopes showed that both approaches are effective. Another approach to control immunogenicity is to modify the host immune system. Nanoparticles containing synthetic vaccine particles encapsulating rapamycin can induce immune tolerance and prevent anti-drug antibody formation. This treatment restores RIT anti-tumor activity that is otherwise neutralized because of immunogenicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
