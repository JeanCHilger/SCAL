To examine this, mutant recombinant viruses were constructed in which the trailer region was truncated or substituted with leader-complement sequence. This analysis showed that the complete trailer increased promoter activity, facilitating genome production and viral multiplication. In addition, trailer-containing viruses did not induce stress granules, whereas the leader-complement virus mutant did, resulting in poor multi-cycle viral growth. These data demonstrate that although the RSV trailer does not contain a unique essential sequence, it augments virus growth by enabling optimal genome production. In addition, a sequence at the 5′ terminal end of the trailer region allows RSV to subvert stress granule formation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
