Because RSV-induced pulmonary disease is associated with immunopathology, we evaluated the role of IL-10 in modulating the RSV-specific immune response. We found that IL-10 protein levels in the lung were increased following acute RSV infection with maximum production corresponding to the peak of the virus-specific T cell response. The majority of IL-10 producing cells in the lung during acute RSV infection were CD4(+) T cells. The IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells included Foxp3(+)T(regs), Foxp3(−) CD4(+) T cells that co-produce IFN-γ, and Foxp3(−) CD4(+) T cells that do not co-produce IFN-γ. RSV infection of IL-10-deficient mice resulted in more severe disease, as measured by increased weight loss and airway resistance, as compared to control mice. We also observed an increase in the magnitude of the RSV-induced CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell response that correlated with increased disease severity in the absence of IL-10 or following IL-10R blockade. Interestingly, IL-10R blockade during acute RSV infection altered CD4(+) T cell subset distribution, resulting in a significant increase in IL-17A-producing CD4(+) T cells and a concomitant decrease in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. These results demonstrate that IL-10 plays a critical role in modulating the adaptive immune response to RSV by limiting T-cell-mediated pulmonary inflammation and injury.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
