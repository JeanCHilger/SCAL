<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-10-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Early Viral Entry Assays for the Identification and Evaluation of Antiviral Compounds</TITLE><BODY>Cell-based systems are useful for discovering antiviral agents. Dissecting the viral life cycle, particularly the early entry stages, allows a mechanistic approach to identify and evaluate antiviral agents that target specific steps of the viral entry. In this report, the methods of examining viral inactivation, viral attachment, and viral entry/fusion as antiviral assays for such purposes are described, using hepatitis C virus as a model. These assays should be useful for discovering novel antagonists/inhibitors to early viral entry and help expand the scope of candidate antiviral agents for further drug development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
