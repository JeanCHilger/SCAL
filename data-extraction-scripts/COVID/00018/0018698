In this study, we evaluated the strictness of the previously outlined cleavage rules, accounting for the timing and outcome of each of three cleavages within the ns polyprotein P1234, and assessed the significance of residues P6 to P4 within the cleavage sites using an alanine scanning approach. The processing of the 1/2 and 3/4 sites was most strongly affected following changes in residues P5 and P4, respectively. However, none of the mutations had a detectable effect on the processing of the 2/3 site. An analysis of recombinant viruses bearing combinations of mutations in cleavage sites revealed tolerance toward the cooccurrence of native and mutated cleavage sites within the same polyprotein, suggesting a remarkable plasticity of the protease recognition pocket. Even in a virus in which all of the cleavage sequences were replaced with alanines in the P6, P5, and P4 positions, the processing pattern was largely preserved, without leading to reversion of cleavage site mutations. Instead, the emergence of second-site mutations was identified, among which Q706R/L in nsP2 was confirmed to be associated with the recognition of the P4 position within the modified cleavage sites. Our results imply that the spatial arrangement of the viral replication complex inherently contributes to scissile-site presentation for the protease, alleviating stringent sequence recognition requirements yet ensuring the precision and the correct order of processing events. Obtaining a proper understanding of the consequences of cleavage site manipulations may provide new tools for taming alphaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
