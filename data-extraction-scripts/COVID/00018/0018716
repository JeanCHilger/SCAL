Here we assess a novel vaccination strategy based on the intradermal delivery of a SynCon(Â®) DNA-based vaccine encoding engineered RSV-F using a surface electroporation device (SEP) to target epidermal cells, in clinically relevant experimental models. We demonstrate the ability of this strategy to elicit robust immune responses. Importantly we demonstrate complete resistance to pulmonary infection at a single low dose of vaccine in the cotton rat RSV/A challenge model. In contrast to the formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine, there was no enhanced lung inflammation upon virus challenge after DNA vaccination. In summary the data presented outline the pre-clinical development of a highly efficacious, tolerable and safe non-replicating vaccine delivery strategy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
