<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Advances in the Renin Angiotensin System: Focus on Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Angiotensin-(1–7)</TITLE><BODY>The contribution of the renin angiotensin system to physiology and pathology is undergoing a rapid reconsideration of its mechanisms from emerging new concepts implicating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-(1–7) as new elements negatively influencing the vasoconstrictor, trophic, and pro-inflammatory actions of angiotensin II. This component of the system acts to oppose the vasoconstrictor and proliferative effects on angiotensin II through signaling mechanisms mediated by the mas receptor. In addition, a reduced expression of the vasodepressor axis composed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-(1–7) may contribute to the expression of essential hypertension, the remodeling of heart and renal function associated with this disease, and even the physiology of pregnancy and the development of eclampsia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
