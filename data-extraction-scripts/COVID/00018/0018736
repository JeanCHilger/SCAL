Here, we compare the performance of AF culture with a novel technique for the diagnosis of MIAC that can provide results within eight hours by combining broad-range real-time polymerase chain reaction with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to identify and quantify genomic material from bacteria and viruses in AF. METHODS: AF samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 142 women with preterm labor (PTL) and intact membranes were analyzed using cultivation techniques (aerobic, anaerobic and genital mycoplasmas) as well as PCR/ESI-MS. The prevalence and relative magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation [AF Interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration ≥ 2.6 ng/mL], acute histologic chorioamnionitis, spontaneous preterm delivery, and perinatal mortality were examined according to the results of these two tests. RESULTS: 1) The prevalence of MIAC in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes was 7% using standard cultivation techniques and 12% using PCR/ESI-MS; 2) seven of ten patients with positive AF culture also had positive PCR/ESI-MS [≥17 genome equivalents per PCR reaction well (GE/well)] 3) patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (≥17 GE/well) and negative AF cultures had significantly higher rates of intra-amniotic inflammation and histologic acute chorioamnionitis, shorter intervals to delivery [median (interquartile range-IQR)], and offspring at higher risk of perinatal mortality, than women with both tests negative [90% (9/10) vs. 32% (39/122); (p<0.001); 70% (7/10) vs. 35% (39/112); (p=0.04); 1 (IQR: <1 – 2) days vs. 25 (IQR: 5 – 51) days; (p=0.002); OR: 5.6; 95% CI: 1.4 – 22, respectively]; 5) there were no significant differences in these factors between patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (≥17 GE/well) who had negative AF cultures compared to those with positive AF cultures; and 6) PCR/ESI-MS detected genomic material from viruses in two patients (1.4%). CONCLUSION: 1) Rapid diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection is possible using PCR/ESI-MS, which can provide results within 8 hours; 2) the combined use of biomarkers of inflammation and PCR/ESI-MS allows for the rapid identification of specific bacteria and viruses in women with preterm labor and intra-amniotic infection; and 3) this approach may allow for administration of timely and specific interventions to reduce morbidity attributed to infection-induced preterm birth.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
