<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-11-12</DATELINE><TITLE>SYNCRIP, a Member of the Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Family, Is Involved in Mouse Hepatitis Virus RNA Synthesis</TITLE><BODY>Several cellular proteins, including several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), have been shown to function as regulatory factors for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA synthesis as a result of their binding to the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the viral RNA. Here, we identified another cellular protein, p70, which has been shown by UV cross-linking to bind both the positive- and negative-strand UTRs of MHV RNA specifically. We purified p70 with a a one-step RNA affinity purification procedure with the biotin-labeled 5′-UTR. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry identified it as synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP). SYNCRIP is a member of the hnRNP family and localizes largely in the cytoplasm. The p70 was cross-linked to the MHV positive- or negative-strand UTR in vitro and in vivo. The bacterially expressed SYNCRIP was also able to bind to the 5′-UTR of both strands. The SYNCRIP-binding site was mapped to the leader sequence of the 5′-UTR, requiring the UCUAA repeat sequence. To investigate the functional significance of SYNCRIP in MHV replication, we expressed a full-length or a C-terminally truncated form of SYNCRIP in mammalian cells expressing the MHV receptor. The overexpression of either form of SYNCRIP inhibited syncytium formation induced by MHV infection. Furthermore, downregulation of the endogenous SYNCRIP with a specific short interfering RNA delayed MHV RNA synthesis; in contrast, overexpression or downregulation of SYNCRIP did not affect MHV translation. These results suggest that SYNCRIP may be directly involved in MHV RNA replication as a positive regulator. This study identified an additional cellular hnRNP as an MHV RNA-binding protein potentially involved in viral RNA synthesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
