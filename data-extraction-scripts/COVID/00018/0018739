Two 3′ genomic region sites, between ORF4′ and ORF2b and between ORF4 and ORF5, were utilized for insertion of the myxoma M013 gene with a C-terminal V5 tag followed by one of the three inserted transcription regulatory sequences (TRS), TRS2′, TRS4′ or TRS7. M013 insertion at the ORF4′/ORF2b site but not the ORF4/ORF5 site generated progeny virus but only recombinant viruses with an inserted TRS2′ retained the entire M013 gene through passage four. Insertion of an auto-fluorescent protein gene, iLOV, with an inserted TRS2′ at the ORF4′/ORF2b site generated viable progeny virus and iLOV expression was maintained through passage eight. Although regulation of SHFV subgenomic RNA synthesis is complex, the ORF4′/ORF2b site, which is located between the two sets of minor structural proteins, is able to tolerate foreign gene insertion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
