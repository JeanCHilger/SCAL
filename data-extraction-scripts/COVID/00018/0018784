We investigated the levels of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a cohort of HIV-infected adults with and without osteonecrosis of the femoral head. METHODS: 43 HIV-infected patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head and a comparison group of 50 HIV-infected patients with negative MR imaging of the hips and for whom serial plasma samples were available were included. D-dimer and CRP levels were measured prior to and at the time of diagnosis for osteonecrosis patients, at the time of negative MR imaging of the hips for controls, and ≥6 months later for both groups. RESULTS: Biomarker levels were elevated at the time of diagnosis in the osteonecrosis cohort compared with controls. Median D-dimer value was 0.32 µg/mL in the osteonecrosis group compared to <0.22 µg/mL in the control group (p=0.016). For CRP the corresponding values were 2.52 mg/L and 1.23 mg/L (p=0.003). Post-diagnosis, D-dimer and CRP levels were also elevated in the osteonecrosis patients compared to controls. Linear regression demonstrated a rise in D-dimer levels from pre-diagnosis to diagnosis in the osteonecrosis patients while CRP levels did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to controls, patients who developed osteonecrosis had elevated levels of D-dimer and CRP at diagnosis. D-dimer levels increased while CRP levels did not change significantly from pre-diagnosis to diagnosis. These data suggest that patients with higher levels of inflammation are at an increased risk of osteonecrosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
