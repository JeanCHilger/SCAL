Our knowledge regarding the generation and/or maintenance of immunity by parenchymal or circulating T cells has been gathered from either persistent (>60 days) or rapidly cleared (<10 days) infections. However, the roles of these distinct T cell pools in infections that are cleared over the course of several weeks are not understood. Clearance of the highly virulent intracellular bacterium, Francisella tularensis (Ftt) following pulmonary infection of immune animals is a protracted, T cell dependent process requiring approximately 30-40 days and serves as a model for infections that are not acutely controlled. Using this model, we found that intranasal vaccination increased the number of tissue resident CD4(+) T(eff) cells and subsequent challenge of immune mice with Ftt led to a significant expansion of polyfunctional, parenchymal CD4(+) T(eff) cells compared to the circulating pool. Despite the dominant in vivo response by parenchymal CD4(+) T cells after vaccination and challenge, circulating CD4(+) T cells were superior at controlling intracellular Ftt replication in vitro. Further examination in vivo revealed temporal requirements for resident and circulating T cells during Ftt infection. These requirements were in direct contrast to other pulmonary infections that are cleared rapidly in immune animals. The data herein provide important insights into the role of specific T cell populations that will be essential for design of novel effective vaccines against tularemia and potentially other agents of pulmonary infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
