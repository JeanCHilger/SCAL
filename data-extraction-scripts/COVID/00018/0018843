<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-08-18</DATELINE><TITLE>VITAMIN E AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AMONG ELDERLY NURSING HOME RESIDENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL</TITLE><BODY>CONTEXT: Respiratory infections are prevalent in the elderly, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and utilization of health care services. Vitamin E supplementation has been shown to improve immune response in the elderly. However, the clinical importance of these findings has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of 1-year vitamin E supplementation on respiratory infections in elderly nursing home residents DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from April 1998 to August 2001 SETTING: 33 long-term care facilities in the Boston, Massachusetts area PARTICIPANTS: 617 subjects ≥65 years old, who met the study’s eligibility criteria were enrolled, 73% of whom completed the study. The follow-up time (mean ± SD) was 317±104 and 321±97 days, E and placebo respectively, for all subjects enrolled in the study. INTERVENTION: A daily vitamin E (200 IU) or placebo capsule; all subjects received a capsule containing 1/2 the Recommended Daily Allowance of essential vitamins and minerals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, number of subjects and number of days with respiratory infections (upper and lower), and number of new antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant effect of vitamin E on incidence or number of days with infection for all, upper, or lower respiratory infections. However, fewer vitamin E-supplemented subjects acquired one or more respiratory infections (65% vs 74%, risk ratio=0.88, 95% CI=0.75–0.99, p=0.036 for completed subjects; 60% vs 68%, risk ratio=0.88, 95% CI=0.76–1.00, p=0.048 for all subjects), or upper respiratory infections (50% vs 62%, risk ratio = 0.81, 95% CI=0.66–0.96, p=0.013 for completed subjects; 44% vs 52%, risk ratio=0.84, 95% CI=0.69–1.00, p=0.051 for all subjects). Post hoc sub-group analysis on common colds indicated that the vitamin E group had a lower incidence of common cold (0.66 vs 0.83 per subject-year, rate ratio=0.80, 95% CI=0.64–0.98, p=0.035 for completed subjects; 0.67 vs 0.81 per subject-year, rate ratio=0.83, 95% CI=0.68–1.01, p=0.057 for all subjects) and fewer subjects in the vitamin E group acquired one or more colds (46% vs 57%, risk ratio=0.80, 95% CI=0.64–0.96, p=0.016 for completed subjects; 40% vs 48%, risk ratio=0.83, 95% CI=0.67–1.00, p=0.052 for all subjects). There was no statistically significant vitamin E effect on antibiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with 200 IU per day vitamin E did not have a statistically significant effect on lower respiratory infections in elderly nursing home residents. However, we observed a protective effect of vitamin E supplementation on upper respiratory infections, particularly the common cold, that merits further investigation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
