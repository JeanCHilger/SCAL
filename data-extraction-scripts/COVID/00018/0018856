Unexpectedly, we found that transgenic mice globally overexpressing human sPLA(2)-X (PLA2G10-Tg) displayed striking immunosuppressive and lean phenotypes with lymphopenia and increased M2-like macrophages, accompanied by marked elevation of free ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites. Studies using Pla2g10-deficient mice revealed that endogenous sPLA(2)-X, which is highly expressed in the colon epithelium and spermatozoa, mobilized ω3 PUFAs or their metabolites to protect against dextran sulfate-induced colitis and to promote fertilization, respectively. In colitis, sPLA(2)-X deficiency increased colorectal expression of Th17 cytokines, and ω3 PUFAs attenuated their production by lamina propria cells partly through the fatty acid receptor GPR120. In comparison, cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)α) protects from colitis by mobilizing ω6 arachidonic acid metabolites, including prostaglandin E(2). Thus, our results underscore a previously unrecognized role of sPLA(2)-X as an ω3 PUFA mobilizer in vivo, segregated mobilization of ω3 and ω6 PUFA metabolites by sPLA(2)-X and cPLA(2)α, respectively, in protection against colitis, and the novel role of a particular sPLA(2)-X-driven PUFA in fertilization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
