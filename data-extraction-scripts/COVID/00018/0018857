In recent years, it has become clear that the memory T cell response to most viruses is remarkably diverse in phenotype, function, and tissue distribution, and can undergo dynamic changes during its long-term maintenance in vivo. However, the role of this variegation and compartmentalization of memory T cells in protective immunity to viruses remains unclear. In this review, we discuss the diverse features of memory T cells that can delineate different subsets, the characteristics of memory T cells thus far identified to promote protective immune responses, and how the heterogeneous nature of memory T cells may also promote immunopathology during antiviral responses. We propose that given the profound heterogeneity of memory T cells, regulation of memory T cells during secondary responses could focus the response to participation of specific subsets, and/or inhibit memory T-cell subsets and functions that can lead to immunopathology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
