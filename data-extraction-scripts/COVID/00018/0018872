However, the basis for Treg cytokine expression in various compartments of the periodontium remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-35 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), with a view to understanding its role in this disease, and ultimately providing improved treatments. Peripheral blood, periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were collected from patients with CP or impacted teeth, the latter serving as healthy controls. The expression levels of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in PBMCs and periodontal tissues were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the IL-35 protein expression in GCFs and sera was quantified by ELISA. The relative expression of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in the affected tissues of patients with CP was significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.05). The mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCFs and sera of patients with periodontitis was also significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.001). IL-35 protein and periodontal clinical indicators were negatively correlated. It was hypothesized that the increased level of IL-35 plays a protective role in periodontal disease by maintaining immune system homeostasis and dampening the inflammatory response, and highlights IL-35 as a potential new therapy for the treatment of periodontitis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
