We identified for the first time, a stability control region between residues 97 and 118. Fragments of tropomyosin lacking this region (1–81, 1–92, and 1–99) still fold into two-stranded α-helical coiled-coils but are significantly less stable (T(m) between 26–28.5°C) than longer fragments containing this region (1–119, 1–131, 1–260 and 1–284) which show a large increase in their thermal midpoints (T(m) between 40–43°C) for a ΔT(m) of 16°C between 1–99 and 1–119. We further investigated two additional fragments which ended between residues 99 and 119, that is fragments 1–105 and 1–110. These fragments were more stable than 1–99 and less stable than 1–119 and showed that there were three separate sites that synergistically contribute to the large jump in protein stability (two electrostatic clusters, 97–104 and 112–118 and one hydrophobic interaction from Leu 110. All the residues involved in these stabilizing interactions are located outside the hydrophobic core a and d positions which have been shown to be the major contributor to coiled-coil stability. Our results clearly show that protein stability is more complex than previously thought and unique sites can synergistically control protein stability over long distances.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
