Here, we show that low-dose infection with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) caused rapid, transient inflammatory monocytosis that required type I IFN and TLR7 signaling. Both signals were critical for induction of IFN stimulated gene expression and CCR2 ligand upregulation in the BM microenvironment in response to LCMV infection. Experiments utilizing bone marrow chimeric mice demonstrated that type I IFN- and TLR7-signaling on either hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic cells was sufficient to initiate monocytosis in response to LCMV infection. BM plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) generated type I IFN directly ex vivo, suggesting that pDC are a hematopoietic contributor of type I IFN in the BM early during LCMV infection. Overall, we describe novel roles for type I IFN and TLR7 signaling in non-hematopoietic cells and BM pDC in directing interferon stimulated gene and CCR2 ligand expression in the BM to initiate an increase in blood inflammatory monocytes during viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
