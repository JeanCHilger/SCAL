<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Detection of Human Influenza A Viruses by Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification</TITLE><BODY>Here we describe the use of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to detect human influenza viruses (H1 to H3). Our results were correlated 100% with results deduced from routine clinical diagnostic tests. In addition, we also developed a LAMP assay specific for human Î²-actin cDNA as a quality control test.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
