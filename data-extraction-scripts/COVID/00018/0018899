The severity and rates of rhinovirus acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in adults are uncertain. OBJECTIVES: We determined rhinovirus-associated ARI rates in adults presenting for care in multiple settings and identified factors associated with rhinovirus detection. METHODS: This prospective, population-based cohort enrolled Tennessee residents â‰¥18 years old in the emergency department (ED), outpatient clinics, or hospitalized for ARI December 2008-May 2010. Nasal/throat swabs were collected and tested for rhinovirus and other viruses by RT-PCR. Rates of ED visits and hospitalizations were calculated and rhinovirus-positive and -negative patients were compared. RESULTS: Among 2351 enrollees, rhinovirus was detected in 247 (11%). There were 7 rhinovirus-associated ED visits and 3 hospitalizations per 1000 adults annually. Patients with rhinovirus, compared to virus-negative ARI, were more likely to present with wheezing (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.35, p<0.001), to be a current smoker (OR 2.31, CI 1.68-3.19) or live with a smoker (OR 1.72, CI 1.10-2.67), have a history of chronic respiratory disease (OR 1.61, CI 1.17-2.22), and were less likely to be hospitalized versus seen in the outpatient setting (OR 0.58, CI 0.41-0.83). CONCLUSION: Rhinovirus is associated with a substantial number of ED visits and hospitalizations for ARI in adults. There may be modifiable factors that can reduce the likelihood of presenting with rhinovirus-associated ARI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
