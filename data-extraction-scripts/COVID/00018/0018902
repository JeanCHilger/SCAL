In this study, 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase 2 genes were cloned from Chinese domestic pigs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the 2024-bp long open reading fame encodes 707 amino acids. There are two conserved regions in this protein: the nucleotidyltransferase domain, and the 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase domain (OAS). Genetic evolution analysis showed that the 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase 2 gene in domestic pigs is closely related to that of cattle. There are multiple antigenic sites, no signal peptide, and no transmembrane region in the gene, which is predicted to be a hydrophilic protein. Secondary structures were found to be mainly alpha helix-based; its tertiary structure is close to that of humans and cattle, but not that of mice. Tissue distribution results indicated that this protein is distributed in multiple organs, with high distribution in the liver; it is mainly localized in the cytoplasm. PRRSV infection, interferon-beta, and Poly(I: C) treatment all promoted 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase 2 gene expression. Overexpression and RNA silencing of porcine OAS2 inhibited and promoted PRRSV replication in cells, respectively. The inhibitory effect of porcine OAS2 was mainly dependent on RNase L, similar to what was predicted. This study has laid the foundation for future antiviral studies in pig, and provided a new way of preventing and treating PRRSV in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
