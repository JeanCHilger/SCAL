Here we established an in vivo imaging system that combines two-photon excitation microscopy and fluorescent influenza viruses of different pathogenicity. This approach allowed us to monitor and correlate several parameters and physiological changes including the spread of infection, pulmonary permeability, pulmonary perfusion speed, number of recruited neutrophils in infected lungs, and neutrophil motion in the lungs of live mice. Several physiological changes were larger and occurred earlier in mice infected with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus compared with those infected with a mouse-adapted human strain. These findings demonstrate the potential of our in vivo imaging system to provide novel information about the pathophysiological consequences of virus infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
