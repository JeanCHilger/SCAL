METHODS: A CENP-focused protein microarray was fabricated by spotting 14 purified CENP. These microarrays were individually incubated with 35 ACA-positive SSc sera and 20 ACA-negative healthy control samples. Newly identified CENP autoantigens with high sensitivities were selected for validation and characterization. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed 11 CENP are potential target antigens of ACA in patients with SSc. Of them, 5 [CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-M (isoform I), CENP-J, and CENP-T] are novel, among which CENP-P and CENP-Q showed high sensitivities in ACA-positive SSc sera of 34.3% and 28.6%, respectively. Subsequently, 186 SSc sera (35 ACA-positives and 151 negatives), 69 ACA-positive sera from other various autoimmune diseases (primary Sj√∂gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and primary biliary cirrhosis), and 31 healthy sera were assayed for the presence of anti-CENP-P and -Q autoantibodies by ELISA followed by Western blotting analysis. CENP-P and -Q autoantibodies were detected in ACA-positive sera of various disease groups; among them, SSc showed the highest detection rate. Anti-CENP-P was also found in 9 of the 151 ACA-negative sera. Analyses of the correlation with clinical information showed anti-CENP-P-positive patients had higher levels of IgG, IgA, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the ACA-positive cohort and were more vulnerable to renal disease in the ACA-negative patients with SSc. Regardless of ACA status, anti-CENP-P or Q-negative patients seem to be predominantly affected by interstitial lung disease. CONCLUSION: CENP-P and CENP-Q were identified as novel ACA autoantigens by CENP microarray assays followed by validation of ELISA and Western blotting. Both of them have prognostic utility for interstitial lung disease. CENP-P was associated with renal disease in an ACA-negative cohort.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
