Here we mapped the receptor binding domain in the S protein to a 231-amino-acid fragment (residues 358 to 588) by evaluating the interaction of spike truncation variants with receptor-expressing cells and soluble DPP4. Antibodies to this domain—much less so those to the preceding N-terminal region—efficiently neutralize MERS-CoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
