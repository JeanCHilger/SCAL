We hypothesised that HRVC would be present in children with acute asthma and cause more severe attacks than other viruses or HRV groups. METHODS: Children with acute asthma (n=128, 2â€“16 years) were recruited on presentation to an emergency department. Asthma exacerbation severity was assessed and respiratory viruses and HRV strains were identified in a nasal aspirate. RESULTS: The majority of the children studied had moderate to severe asthma (85.2%) and 98.9% were admitted to hospital. HRV was detected in 87.5% and other respiratory viruses in 14.8% of children, most of whom also had HRV. HRVC were present in the majority of children with acute asthma (59.4%) and associated with more severe asthma. Children with HRVC (n=76) had higher asthma severity scores than children whose HRV infection was HRVA or HRVB only (n=34, p=0.018), and all other children (n=50, p=0.016). Of 19 children with a non-HRV virus, 13 had HRV co-infections, seven of these being HRVC. CONCLUSION: HRVC accounts for the majority of asthma attacks in children presenting to hospital and causes more severe attacks than previously-known HRV groups and other viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
