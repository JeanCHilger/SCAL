A controversial question has been whether DC-SIGN functions as a complete receptor for both binding and internalization of dengue virus (DENV) or whether it is solely a cell surface attachment factor, requiring either hand-off to another receptor or a co-receptor for internalization. To examine this question, we used four cell types: human immature dendritic cells and NIH3T3 cells expressing either wild type DC-SIGN or two internalization-deficient DC-SIGN mutants, in which either the three cytoplasmic internalization motifs are silenced by alanine substitutions or the cytoplasmic region is truncated. Using confocal and super-resolution imaging and high content single particle tracking, we investigated DENV binding, DC-SIGN surface transport, endocytosis, as well as cell infectivity. DC-SIGN was found colocalized with DENV inside cells suggesting hand-off at the plasma membrane to another receptor did not occur. Moreover, all three DC-SIGN molecules on NIH3T3 cells supported cell infection. These results imply the involvement of a co-receptor because cells expressing the internalization-deficient mutants could still be infected.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
