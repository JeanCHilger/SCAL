Amphiregulin produced by mouse hematopoietic cells contributes to the elimination of a nematode infection by a Type 2 effector response. OBJECTIVE: To identify the human peripheral blood cell population expressing amphiregulin. METHODS: Amphiregulin-expressing cells were identified by flow cytometry of cell surface markers and histological staining. Histamine and amphiregulin in supernatants were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA expression. RESULTS: Stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 antibodies induced expression of amphiregulin mRNA and protein by a non-T cell population. The amphiregulin-producing cells were basophils, as judged by morphology and expression of CD203c and CD123 (IL-3 receptor alpha chain). Activated mouse basophils also produced amphiregulin. Amphiregulin expression by basophils in response to anti-TCR stimulation required IL-3 produced by T cells, and IL-3 alone induced high levels of amphiregulin expression by purified basophils. Amphiregulin was expressed at much higher levels when human basophils were stimulated by IL-3 than by IgE cross-linking, whereas the opposite was true for IL-4 expression and histamine release. Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like growth factor was also expressed by IL-3-stimulated human basophils. PBMC from asthmatic human subjects contained significantly higher numbers of basophils able to produce amphiregulin, compared to allergic or non-allergic controls. CONCLUSION: IL-3 can induce basophils to express high levels of amphiregulin, which may contribute to tissue remodeling during type 2 immune responses such as asthma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
