The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of SpO(2) directed oxygen therapy and to calculate sample size base on differences in 28-day mortality rates for a large sample-sized randomized trial. METHODS: This prospective pilot study enrolled 214 adult patients with an expected intensive care unit (ICU) stay of more than 72 hours. Patients were randomized into a low SpO(2) group (SpO(2) 90–95%) or high SpO(2) group (SpO(2) 96–100%). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included in the low SpO(2) group, and 114 patients were included in the high SpO(2) group. The demographic and baseline characteristics were not different. The time-weighted SpO(2) average was significantly lower in the low SpO(2) group than in the high SpO(2) group [mean ± standard deviation (SD), 95.7%±2.3% vs. 98.2%±1.8%, P<0.001]. Twenty-six patients (26%) in the low SpO(2) group died within 28 days after inclusion, while 37 patients (32.5%) in the high SpO(2) group died (P=0.301). The time to death within 28 days between the two groups was not different (P=0.284). CONCLUSIONS: SpO(2) directed oxygen therapy in critically ill patients was feasible. Our pilot trial necessitates and rationalizes our large-sample multicenter trial.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
