Since MSR1 expression was upregulated in the livers of patients with fulminant hepatitis (FH), we investigated the functional mechanism of Msr1 in FH pathogenesis. METHODS: Msr1-deficient (Msr1(−/−)) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain-A59 (MHV-A59) to induce FH, and the levels of tissue damage, serum alanine aminotransferase, inflammatory cytokines and complement component 5a (C5a) were measured and compared. Liver injury was studied after MHV infection with or without neutrophil depletion. RESULTS: Our results showed that Msr1(−/−) mice were resistant to MHV-induced hepatitis. Treatment with the C5a receptor antagonist (C5aRa) diminished the differences in inflammatory responses and liver injury between MHV-infected wild-type and Msr1(−/−) mice, suggesting that C5a-induced proinflammatory response plays a critical role in the Msr1-mediated regulation of FH pathogenesis. We demonstrated that Msr1 efficiently enhanced transforming growth factor-activated kinase-1 phosphorylation in neutrophils upon MHV-A59 stimulation, thereby promoting the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway and subsequent NETosis formation. Moreover, we provided evidence that blockage of Msr1 attenuated the liver damage caused by MHV-A59 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Msr1 promotes the pathogenesis of virus-induced FH by enhancing induction of neutrophil NETosis and subsequent complement activation. Targeting Msr1 may be employed as a new immunotherapeutic strategy for FH. LAY SUMMARY: Virus-induced fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a disease with a high mortality worldwide. Enhanced levels of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (Msr1) in the liver of patients with FH and of murine experimental FH indicated Msr1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of FH. Herein, we demonstrate that mice deficient in Msr1 are resistant to FH induced by MHV-A59, and the Msr1 inhibitor fucoidan suppresses the progression of FH in mice. Our study suggests that use of drugs inhibiting MSR1 function could be beneficial to patients with FH.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
