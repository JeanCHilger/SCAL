The three distinct Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) have various capacities for binding ABH histo-blood group antigens, suggesting that different mechanisms for NLV attachment likely exist. Importantly, antisera from NV-infected human volunteers, as well as from mice inoculated with packaged Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons expressing NV VLPs, blocked the ability of NV VLPs to bind synthetic H type 1, Le(b), and H type 3, suggesting a potential mechanism for antibody-mediated neutralization of NV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
