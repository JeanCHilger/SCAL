Bacterial otopathogens and respiratory viruses interact and play important roles in AOM development. Better understanding of viral and bacterial interactions may lead to innovative ways to lessen the burden of this common childhood disease. RECENT FINDINGS: There has been increasing evidence that AOM occurs during URI, even in the absence of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. Among the types of viruses associated with AOM, respiratory syncytial virus continues to be the most commonly detected. It is still unclear whether viral load plays an important role in AOM development, but symptomatic URI (as opposed to asymptomatic viral infection) is crucial. Widespread use of bacterial and viral vaccines in young children, including pneumococcal conjugate and influenza vaccines, has led to the reduction in otitis media-related health care use between 2001 and 2011. There has been no new vaccine against respiratory viruses other than influenza. SUMMARY: Progress has been made towards reduction of the burden of AOM in the last decade. Success in reducing AOM incidence will rely mainly on prevention of nasopharyngeal otopathogen colonization, as well as reduction in the incidence of viral URI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
