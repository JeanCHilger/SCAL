METHODS: We used EHRs at two Boston tertiary care hospitals, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital, to identify HIV-infected patients who were virologically suppressed (HIV RNA ≤400 copies/mL) on antiretroviral therapy between 1/1/05 and 12/31/06. We used a multivariable logistic model with data from Massachusetts General Hospital to derive a one-year virologic failure prediction rule. The model was validated using data from the Brigham and Women's Hospital. We then simplified the scoring scheme to develop a clinical prediction rule. RESULTS: The one-year virologic failure prediction model, using data from 712 Massachusetts General Hospital patients, demonstrated good discrimination (c-statistic 0.78) and calibration (χ(2) =6.6, p =0.58). The validation model, based on 362 Brigham and Women's Hospital patients, also showed good discrimination (c-statistic 0.79) and calibration (χ(2) =1.9, p =0.93). The clinical prediction rule included seven predictors, Sub-optimal Adherence, CD4 count <100/μL, Drug and/or Alcohol Abuse, Heavily ART Experienced, Missed ≥1Appointment, Prior Virologic Failure, and Suppressed ≤12 months, and appropriately stratified patients in the validation dataset into low, medium and high risk groups, with one-year virologic failure rates of 3.0%, 13.0% and 28.6%. CONCLUSIONS: A risk score based on seven variables available in the EHR predicts HIV virologic failure at one year and could be used for targeted interventions to improve outcomes in HIV disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
