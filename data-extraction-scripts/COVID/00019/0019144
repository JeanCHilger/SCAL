The source of O(2)(• -) formation was determined using a number of enzyme inhibitors. The role of NO was explored using NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and the distribution of NOS isoforms and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-), an index of NO–O(2)(• -) interactions) assessed by immunocytochemistry. Results: LPS, IL-1α, and TNF-α promoted the formation of O(2)(• -) from PA compared with untreated controls in a time and dose dependent manner, an effect markedly enhanced by removal of the endothelium but completely inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI). L-NAME and the eNOS inhibitor N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO) enhanced O(2)(• -) formation from PA (with endothelium) in response to IL-1α and TNF-α but had no effect on LPS mediated O(2)(• -) formation, whereas L-NAME and the iNOS inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine-HCl (L-NIL) enhanced O(2)(• -) formation only in response to LPS. Conclusions: LPS, IL-1α, and TNF-α promote O(2)(• -) formation through an upregulation of NADPH oxidase activity which is augmented by removal of the endothelium, as well as the inhibition of eNOS (in the case of cytokines) and iNOS (in the case of LPS). The concomitant expression of NOS isoforms (and NO formation) with that of NADPH oxidase may therefore constitute a protective system designed to remove O(2)(• -) through the formation of ONOO(-). If this is so, the integrity of the endothelium may be axiomatic in the progression and severity of ARDS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
