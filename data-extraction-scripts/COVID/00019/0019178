Dysregulated Wnt signaling is associated with many cancers. Currently there exist no drug candidates, or even tool compounds that modulate Wnt-mediated receptor trafficking, and subsequent Wnt signaling. We examined libraries of FDA-approved drugs for their utility as Frizzled internalization modulators, employing a primary imaged-based GFP-fluorescence assay that uses Frizzled1 endocytosis as the readout. We now report that the anti-helminthic niclosamide, a drug used for the treatment of tapeworm, promotes Frizzled1 endocytosis, down regulates Dishevelled-2 protein, and inhibits Wnt3A-stimulated β-catenin stabilization and LEF/TCF reporter activity. Additionally, following niclosamide mediated internalization, the Frizzled1 receptor co-localizes in vesicles containing Transferrin and agonist-activated β(2)-adrenergic receptor. Therefore, niclosamide may serve as a negative modulator of Wnt/Frizzled1 signaling by depleting up-stream signaling molecules (i.e. Frizzled and Dishevelled), and moreover may provide a valuable means to study the physiological consequences of Wnt signaling.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
