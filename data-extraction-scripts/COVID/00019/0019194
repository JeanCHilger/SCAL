The roles of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress were examined in HIV-1- and HCV-coinfected human hepatic cells. Morphine (the bioactive product of heroin), HIV-1 Tat and the MN strain gp120 (gp120(MN)) proteins, and X4 HIV-1(LAI/IIIB) and R5 HIV-1(SF162) isolates were used to study the mechanisms of disease progression in HCV (JFH1)-infected Huh7.5.1 cell populations. HCV increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release and augmented production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in Huh7.5.1 cells. Morphine preferentially affected R5-tropic, but not X4-tropic, HIV-1 interactions with Huh7.5.1 cells. HIV-1 proteins or isolates increased cytokine release in HCV-infected cells, while adding morphine to coinfected cells caused complex imbalances, significantly disrupting cytokine secretion depending on the cytokine, morphine concentration, exposure duration, and particular pathogen involved. Production of ROS, NO, and 3-NT increased significantly in HCV- and HIV-1-coexposed cells while exposure to morphine further increased ROS. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly decreased oxyradicals, cytokine levels, and HCV protein levels. Our findings indicate that hepatic inflammation is increased by combined exposure to HCV and HIV-1, that the ubiquitin-proteasome system and NF-κB contribute to key aspects of the response, and that morphine further exacerbates the disruption of host defenses. The results suggest that opioid abuse and HIV-1 coinfection each further accelerate HCV-mediated liver disease by dysregulating immune defenses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
