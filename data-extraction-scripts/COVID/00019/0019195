To determine the lag between T-cell priming and optimal activity within the CNS, the accumulation of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells in the CNS relative to that in peripheral lymphoid organs was assessed by using gamma interferon-specific ELISPOT assays and class I tetramer staining. Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were first detected in the cervical lymph nodes. Expansion in the spleen was delayed and less pronounced but also preceded accumulation in the CNS. The data further suggest peripheral acquisition of cytolytic function, thus enhancing CD8(+)-T-cell effector function upon cognate antigen recognition in the CNS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
