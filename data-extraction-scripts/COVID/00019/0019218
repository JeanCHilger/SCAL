In this review, we discuss mechanisms by which viruses manipulate host–gene expression at the level of mRNA decay in order to enable the virus to evade host antiviral responses to allow viral survival and replication. We discuss different cellular RNA decay pathways, including the deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay pathway, and various strategies that viruses exploit to manipulate these pathways in order to create a virus-friendly cellular environment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
