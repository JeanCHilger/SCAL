Interferon (IFN)-γ inducible protein, CXCL10/IP-10, is a member of the CXC chemokine family with pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties. The purpose of this study was to determine whether maternal serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 change in patients with acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the difference in maternal serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 in pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis (N=41) and normal pregnant women (N=89). Pyelonephritis was defined in the presence of a positive urine culture, fever and maternal clinical signs; blood cultures were performed in 36 cases. Maternal serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 were measured by a sensitive immunoassay. Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: (1) The median serum concentration of CXCL10/IP-10 in pregnant patients with pyelonephritis was significantly higher than in normal pregnant women (median 318.5 pg/mL, range: 78.8–2459.2 vs. median: 116.1 pg/mL, range:40.7–1314.3, respectively; p < 0.001); (2) maternal median serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 did not differ significantly among patients with acute pyelonephritis with and without bacteremia (positive blood cultures: median: 362.6 pg/mL, range: 100.2–2459.2 vs. negative blood cultures: median 298.9 pg/mL, range: 108.5–1148.7, respectively; p = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Pyelonephritis in pregnant women is associated with increased maternal serum concentration of the chemokine CXCL10/IP-10.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
