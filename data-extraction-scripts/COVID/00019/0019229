It has also been suggested that PS-ONs inhibit HIV-1 by acting as attachment inhibitors that bind to the V3 loop of gp120 and prevent the gp120-CD4 interaction. Here we show that PS-ONs (and their fully 2′-O-methylated derivatives) are potent inhibitors of HIV-1-mediated membrane fusion and HIV-1 replication in a size-dependent, phosphorothioation-dependent manner. PS-ONs interact with a peptide derived from the N-terminal heptad repeat region of gp41, and the HIV-1 fusion-inhibitory activity of PS-ONs is closely correlated with their ability to block gp41 six-helix bundle formation, a critical step during the process of HIV-1 fusion with the target cell. These results suggest that the increased hydrophobicity of PS-ONs may contribute to their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 fusion and entry, because longer PS-ONs (≥30 bases) which have a greater hydrophobicity are more potent in blocking the hydrophobic interactions involved in the gp41 six-helix bundle formation and inhibiting the HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion than shorter PS-ONs (<30 bases). This novel antiviral mechanism of action of long PS-ONs has implications for therapy against infection by HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses with type I fusion proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
