Viral infections may also induce autophagic response. Here we show that hepatitis B virus (HBV), a pathogen that chronically infects â‰ˆ350 million people globally, can enhance autophagic response in cell cultures, mouse liver, and during natural infection. This enhancement of the autophagic response is not coupled by an increase of autophagic protein degradation and is dependent on the viral X protein, which binds to and enhances the enzymatic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III, an enzyme critical for the initiation of autophagy. Further analysis indicates that autophagy enhances HBV DNA replication, with minimal involvement of late autophagic vacuoles in this process. Our studies thus demonstrate that a DNA virus can use autophagy to enhance its own replication and indicate the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of HBV patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
