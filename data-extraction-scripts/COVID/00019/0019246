This was demonstrated by the increased lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a hallmark of autophagy, and by the visualization of characteristic vesicles within infected cells. The response was detected first at 2 h postinfection and persisted for at least 3 days. De novo protein synthesis was not required for the effect, since HCMV that was irradiated with UV light also elicited the response, and furthermore the continuous presence of cycloheximide did not prevent induction. Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) under conditions that inhibited viral gene expression provoked autophagy, whereas UV-irradiated respiratory syncytial virus did not. The induction of autophagy occurred when cells were infected with HCMV or HSV-1 that was gradient purified, but HCMV dense bodies and HSV-1 light particles, each of which lack nucleocapsids and genomes, were inactive. The depletion of regulatory proteins Atg5 and Atg7, which are required for autophagy, reduced LC3 modification in response to infection but did not result in any detectable difference in viral or cellular gene expression at early times after infection. The electroporation of DNA into HFFF2 cultures induced the lipidation of LC3 but double-stranded RNA did not, even though both agents stimulated an innate immune response. The results show a novel, early cellular response to the presence of the incoming virion and additionally demonstrate that autophagy can be induced by the presence of foreign DNA within cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
