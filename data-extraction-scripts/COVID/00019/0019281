To identify a specific mechanism, we evaluated the protective activity of anti-NS1 MAbs to WNV using mice and cells with deficiencies of specific Fc-γ receptors. Our results suggest that only MAbs that recognize cell surface-associated NS1 trigger Fc-γ receptor I- and/or IV-mediated phagocytosis and clearance of WNV-infected cells. These findings may be relevant for generating novel therapeutic MAbs or vaccines against flaviviruses that target the NS1 protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
