MAIN OBSERVATIONS: A six-year-old girl presented to us with four-month history of a generalized intensely pruritic rash, clinically consistent with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, following a febrile illness with common cold symptoms. Clinical remission was not achieved despite of several medications. With reluctance and parent's informed consent, we commenced a course of oral ribavirin syrup at a dose of 300mg daily for five days. Dramatic symptomatic remission was noted five days later. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of ribavirin in Gianotti-Crosti syndrome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
