<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Biosynthesis, Trafficking and Secretion of Pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides</TITLE><BODY>Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is a prohormone that encodes multiple smaller peptide hormones within its structure. These peptide hormones can be generated by cleavage of POMC at basic-residue cleavage sites by prohormone converting enzymes in the regulated secretory pathway of POMC synthesizing endocrine cells and neurons. The peptides are stored inside the cells in dense core secretory granules until released in a stimulus dependent manner. The complexity of the regulation of the biosynthesis, trafficking and secretion of POMC and its peptides reflect an impressive level of control over many factors involved in the ultimate role of POMC expressing cells, i.e. to produce a range of different biologically active peptide hormones ready for action when signaled by the body. From the discovery of POMC as the precursor to ACTH and Î²-Lipotropin in the late 1970s to our current knowledge, the understanding of POMC physiology remains a monumental body of work that has provided insight into many aspects of molecular endocrinology. In this chapter, we describe the intracellular trafficking of POMC in endocrine cells, its sorting into dense core secretory granules and transport of these granules to the regulated secretory pathway. Additionally, we review the enzymes involved in the maturation of POMC to its various peptides and the mechanisms involved in the differential processing of POMC in different cell types. Finally, we highlight studies pertaining to the regulation of ACTH secretion in the anterior and intermediate pituitary and POMC neurons of the hypothalamus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
