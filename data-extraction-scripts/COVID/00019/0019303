We previously identified human ILC3 distinguished by interleukin-22 (IL-22) secretion. Here we characterized a human ILC1 subset that produced Interferon-γ in response to IL-12 and IL-15, had a unique integrin profile, intraepithelial location, hallmarks of TGF-β imprinting and a memory-activated phenotype. Because tissue-resident memory CD8(+) T cells share this profile, intraepithelial ILC1 may be their innate counterparts. In mice, intraepithelial ILC1 were distinguished by CD160 expression and required Nfil3-and Tbx21-encoded transcription factors for development, but not IL-15 receptor-α, indicating that intraepithelial ILC1 are distinct from conventional NK cells. Intraepithelial ILC1 were amplified in Crohn’s disease patients and contributed to pathology in the anti-CD40-induced colitis model in mice. Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 may initiate interferon-γ responses against pathogens, but contribute to pathology when dysregulated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
