In order to compare the sugar- and pathogen-binding properties of LSECtin with those of related but more extensively characterized receptors, such as DC-SIGN, a soluble fragment of LSECtin consisting of the C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain has been expressed in bacteria. A biotin-tagged version of the protein was also generated and complexed with streptavidin to create tetramers. These forms of the carbohydrate-recognition domain were used to probe a glycan array and to characterize binding to oligosaccharide and glycoprotein ligands. LSECtin binds with high selectivity to glycoproteins terminating in GlcNAcβ1-2Man. The inhibition constant for this disaccharide is 3.5 μM, making it one of the best low molecular weight ligands known for any C-type lectin. As a result of the selective binding of this disaccharide unit, the receptor recognizes glycoproteins with truncated complex and hybrid N-linked glycans on glycoproteins. Glycan analysis of the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus reveals the presence of such truncated glycans, explaining the ability of LSECtin to facilitate infection by Ebola virus. High mannose glycans are also present on the viral glycoprotein, which explains why DC-SIGN also binds to this virus. Thus, multiple receptors interact with surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses that bear different types of relatively poorly processed glycans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
