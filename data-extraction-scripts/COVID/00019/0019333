We recently showed that 6 common MHC haplotypes account for essentially all MHC diversity in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) from the island of Mauritius. Here we employ cDNA cloning and sequencing to comprehensively characterize full length MHC class II alleles expressed at the Mafa–DPA, -DPB, -DQA, -DQB, -DRA, and –DRB loci on the 6 common haplotypes. We describe 34 full-length MHC class II alleles, 12 of which are completely novel. Polymorphism was evident at all six loci, including DPA which is considered monomorphic in rhesus macaques. Similar to other old world monkeys, Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) share MHC class II allelic lineages with humans at the DQ and DR loci, but not at the DP loci. Additionally, we identified extensive sharing of MHC class II alleles between MCM and other non-human primates. The characterization of these full length expressed MHC class II alleles will enable researchers to generate MHC class II transferent cell lines and tetramers that can be used to explore CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses in MCM.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
