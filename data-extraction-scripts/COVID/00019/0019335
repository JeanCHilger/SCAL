Then, the antioxidant properties of these substrates were measured by the DPPH test to report their biological activity in terms of their spin trapping action. In particular, one substrate has showed very high biological and scavenging activity, probably due to the strong correlation between its spin trapping activity and structure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
