The human astrovirus Yuc8 polyprotein capsid precursor VP90 is initially processed to yield VP70, and we have shown that this processing is trypsin independent and occurs intracellularly through four cleavages at its carboxy-terminal region. We further showed that VP90-VP70 processing is mediated by caspases, since it was blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), and it was promoted by the apoptosis inducer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Although the cell-associated virus produced in the presence of these compounds was not affected, the release of infectious virus to the cell supernatant was drastically reduced in the presence of z-VAD-fmk and increased by TRAIL, indicating that VP90-VP70 cleavage is important for the virus particles to be released from the cell. This is the first report that describes the induction and utilization of caspase activity by a virus to promote processing of the capsid precursor and dissemination of the viral particles.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
