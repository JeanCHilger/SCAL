We postulated that we could identify mechanisms by which ex vivo stimulation of T cells could reactivate and expand tumor-directed T-cell lines from HPV-positive cancer patients for subsequent adoptive immunotherapy. A total of 68 patients with HPV-associated cancers were studied. Peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with monocyte-derived dendritic cells loaded with pepmixes (peptide libraries of 15-mers overlapping by 11 amino-acids) spanning E6/E7, in the presence or absence of specific accessory cytokines. The resulting T-cell lines were further expanded with pepmix-loaded activated B-cell blasts. IFNÎ³ release and cytotoxic responses to E6/E7 were assessed. We successfully reactivated and expanded (>1200-fold) E6/E7-specific T cells from 8/16 cervical and 33/52 oropharyngeal cancer patients. The presence of the cytokines IL-6, -7, -12 and -15 is critical for this process. These T cell lines possess the desirable characteristics of polyclonality, multiple T-cell subset representation (including the memory compartment) and a T(H)1 bias, and may eliminate E6/E7-positive targets. In conclusion, we have shown it is possible to robustly generate HPV16 E6/E7-directed T-cell lines from patients with HPV16-associated cancers. Because our technique is scalable and good-manufacturing-procedures compliant, these lines could be used for adoptive cellular immunotherapy of patients with HPV16-positive cancers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
