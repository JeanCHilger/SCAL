BAL-MSCs displayed fibroblastic morphology and possessed self-renewal properties. Similar to bone-marrow MSCs, BAL-MSCs expressed mesenchymal markers and both cell types lacked the expression of hematopoetic markers. BAL-MSCs, when cultured in differentiation induction media, differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. Next, we examined if BAL-MSCs have the ability to treat lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in a pig model. Five-week-old commercial pigs were inoculated intra-tracheally with E. coli LPS [(1 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.)].Twelve hours after the LPS inoculation, groups of pigs were inoculated intra-tracheally with BM-MSCs or BAL-MSCs (2Ã—10(6) cells/kg b.wt.). Forty eight hours after the cells administration pigs were euthanized and neutrophils in BAL, lung lesions, and cytokines in lung lysates, and engraftment of MSCs in lungs were examined. Engraftment of BAL-MSCs in injured lungs was significantly higher than the BM-MSCs, however, both cell types were equally effective in attenuating LPS-induced ALI as evidenced by decreased inflammation, lung lesions and proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs of pigs treated with BAL-or BM-MSCs. These data in a preclinical large animal model suggest that BAL-MSCs may be used in clinical settings to treat ALI in humans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
