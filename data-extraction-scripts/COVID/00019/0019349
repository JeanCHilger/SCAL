Astroviruses have been traditionally considered pathogens of the gastrointestinal tract, but they have been recently associated with neurological diseases in humans, cattle, mink, sheep, and pigs. VA1 is the astrovirus genotype most commonly identified from human cases of meningoencephalitis and has been recently propagated in cell culture. VA1 can now be used as a model system to study pathogenesis of the neurological diseases associated with astrovirus infection. In this unit, we describe two fundamental assays to quantify replication and propagation of VA1, a qRT-PCR to measure viral RNA and a TCID(50) assay to measure infectious viral particles.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
