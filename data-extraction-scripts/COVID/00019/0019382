The soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL6R) has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for preventing coronary heart disease. However, little is known about the role of this receptor during viral infection. In this study, we show that sIL6R, but not IL-6, is induced by viral infection via the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway. Interestingly, sIL6R, but not IL-6, exhibited extensive antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses, including hepatitis B virus, influenza virus, human enterovirus 71, and vesicular stomatitis virus. No synergistic effects on antiviral action were observed by combining sIL6R and IL-6. Furthermore, sIL6R mediated antiviral action via the p28 pathway and induced alpha interferon (IFN-α) by promoting the nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB, which led to the activation of downstream IFN effectors, including 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and myxovirus resistance protein (Mx). Thus, our results demonstrate that sIL6R, but not IL-6, plays an important role in the host antiviral response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
