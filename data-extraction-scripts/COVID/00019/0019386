The engraftment potential of PBMCs mobilized with AMD3100 alone, however, has remained unproven. We therefore studied AMD3100-mobilized PBMCs in a canine model. Four dogs received 920 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) before infusion of autologous AMD3100-mobilized PBMCs (median CD34 cell count, 3.9 × 10(6)/kg). Neutrophil (> 0.5 × 10(9)/L [500/μL]) and platelet (> 20 ×/10(9)/L [> 20 000/μL]) recoveries occurred at medians of 9 (range, 7-10) days and 25 (range, 23-38) days, respectively, after TBI, and all dogs had normal marrow function at 1 year after transplantation. To evaluate the long-term engraftment potential of AMD3100-mobilized PBMCs, 5 dogs were given 920 cGy TBI followed by infusion of AMD3100-mobilized PBMCs (median CD34 cell dose, 4.7 × 10(6)/kg) from their dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical littermates. Neutrophil and platelet recoveries occurred at medians of 8 (range, 8-10) days and 26 (range, 26-37) days, respectively, after TBI. With a median follow-up of 53 (range, 33-61) weeks, recipients' marrow function was normal, and blood-donor chimerism levels were 97% to 100%. In summary, both autologous and allogeneic AMD3100-mobilized PBMCs led to prompt and durable engraftment in dogs after 920 cGy TBI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
