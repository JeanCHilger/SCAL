To evaluate healthcare workers’ (HCWs) risk of self-contamination when donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) using fluorescence and MS2 bacteriophage. DESIGN. Prospective pilot study. SETTING. Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS. 36 HCWs: 18 donned/doffed contact precautions (CP) PPE and 18 donned/doffed Ebola virus disease (EVD) PPE. INTERVENTIONS. HCWs donned PPE according to standard protocols. Fluorescent liquid and MS2 bacteriophage were applied to HCWs. HCWs then doffed their PPE. After doffing, HCWs were scanned for fluorescence and swabbed for MS2. MS2 detection was performed using reverse transcriptase PCR. The donning and doffing processes were videotaped and protocol deviations were recorded. RESULTS. 27% of EVD PPE HCWs and 50% of CP PPE HCWs made ≥1 protocol deviation while donning. 100% of EVD PPE HCWs and 67% of CP PPE HCWs made ≥1 protocol deviation while doffing (p=0.02). The median number of doffing protocol deviations among EVD PPE HCWs was 4, vs. 1 among CP PPE HCWs. 15 EVD PPE protocol deviations were committed by doffing assistants and/or trained observers. Fluorescence was detected on 8 (44%) of EVD PPE HCWs and 5 (28%) CP PPE HCWs, most commonly on hands. MS2 was recovered from 2 (11%) EVD PPE HCWs and 3 (17%) CP PPE HCWs. CONCLUSIONS. Protocol deviations were common during both EVD and CP PPE doffing, and some deviations during EVD PPE doffing were committed by the HCWs’ doffing assistant and/or trained observer. Self-contamination was common. PPE donning/doffing are complex and deserve additional study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
