This correlated with an increased antiviral effect of IFN-γ against the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication in vitro. We also observed that a regulatory protein, Protein Inhibitor of NOS-1 (PIN) was down-regulated by IFN-γ treatment, and more ubiquitinated PIN accumulated in IFN-γ treated neurons. In cells of the reticuloendothelial system, IFN-γ treatment induces the expression of a set of low molecular weight MHC-encoded proteins (LMPs), which replace the β -subunit of the proteasome complex during the proteasome neosynthesis, resulting in a complex termed the immunoproteasome. LMP-2,- 7, and -10 were induced and the immunoproteasome was generated by IFN-γ treatment in neuronal cells. Importantly, we observed that IFN-γ induced inhibition of VSV protein synthesis was not dependent on ubiquitination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
