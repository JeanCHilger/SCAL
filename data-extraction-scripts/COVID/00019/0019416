However, no cis-replicating elements have been identified in the coding sequences of the HCV polyprotein until very recently. The existence of highly conserved and stable stem-loop structures in the RNA polymerase NS5B coding sequence, however, has been previously predicted (A. Tuplin, J. Wood, D. J. Evans, A. H. Patel, and P. Simmonds, RNA 8:824-841, 2002). We have selected for our studies a 249-nt-long RNA segment in the C-terminal NS5B coding region (NS5BCR), which is predicted to form four stable stem-loop structures (SL-IV to SL-VII). By deletion and mutational analyses of the RNA structures, we have determined that two of the stem-loops (SL-V and SL-VI) are essential for replication of the HCV subgenomic replicon in Huh-7 cells. Mutations in the loop and the top of the stem of these RNA elements abolished replicon RNA synthesis but had no effect on translation. In vitro gel shift and filter-binding assays revealed that purified NS5B specifically binds to SL-V. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by unlabeled homologous RNA, to a small extent by 3′ NTR RNA, and only poorly by 5′ NTR RNA. The other two stem-loops (SL-IV and SL-VII) of the NS5BCR domain were found to be important but not essential for colony formation by the subgenomic replicon. The precise function(s) of these cis-acting RNA elements is not known.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
