Herpesviruses evolved elaborate mechanisms to escape host immunity, but the immune evasion strategies employed by SVV remain ill-defined. We analysed whether SVV impairs the cellular response to key antiviral cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ). SVV infection inhibited the expression of IFNγ-induced genes like C-X-C motif chemokine 10 and interferon regulatory factor 1. Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) was blocked in SVV-infected cells, which did not involve cellular and viral phosphatases. SVV infection did not downregulate IFNγ receptor α and β chain expression on the cell surface. Instead, STAT1, Janus tyrosine kinases 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 protein levels were significantly decreased in SVV-infected cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SVV targets three proteins in the IFNγ signal transduction pathway to escape the antiviral effects of IFNγ.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
