The most common causes are infection, connective tissue disease, radiation therapy, drug reaction and thoracic operation. Herein, we describe the case of a patient that developed OP after fracture internal fixation. The case was confirmed to be OP by computer tomographic (CT)-guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy, and other causes of OP were excluded. After the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, marked clinical and radiographic improvements occurred. In addition, we discovered increased neutrophils and IL-17A in the lung tissue of the patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report about OP secondary to extrapulmonary operation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
