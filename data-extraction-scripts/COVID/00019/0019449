One clone, named 2F9, almost completely inhibited viral entry. The humanized anti-CD26 MAb YS110 also significantly inhibited infection. These findings indicate that both 2F9 and YS110 are potential therapeutic agents for MERS-CoV infection. YS110, in particular, is a good candidate for immediate testing as a therapeutic modality for MERS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
