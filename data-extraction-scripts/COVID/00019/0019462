A 5-fold difference in Env synthesis was achieved at the translational level by the presence or absence of an out-of-frame initiation codon upstream of the env gene. This perturbation had no effect on the size or processing of Env. In contrast to the variation in Env synthesis, the rMVAs produced similar amounts of HIV Gag, which were expressed from identical cassettes. Mice immunized with the higher Env expressing rMVAs had about 15-fold higher titers of Env antibodies and several fold higher frequencies of Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells than mice immunized with the low expresser. The greater immune response achieved by high expression was maintained over a 100-fold dose range. Importantly, enhanced Env immune responses did not come at the expense of lower Gag T cell responses. These data suggest that for high immunogenicity, rMVAs should be engineered to produce the most recombinant protein that can be achieved without compromising the growth and stability of the rMVA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
