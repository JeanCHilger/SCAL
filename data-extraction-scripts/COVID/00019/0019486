Among these pathways, the mechanisms by which T-box proteins and IL-10 interact to promote a memory T cell fate remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Eomes and IL-10 drive a central memory phenotype in murine CD8(+) T cells. Eomes expression led to increased IL-10 expression by the effector CD8(+) T cells themselves as well as an increase in the level of the lymph node homing selectin CD62L. Furthermore, exposure of effector CD8(+) T cells to IL-10 maintained CD62L expression levels in culture. Thus, Eomes promotes a step-wise transition of effector T cells towards a memory phenotype, synergizing with IL-10 to enhance the expression of CD62L. The early augmentation of lymph node homing markers by Eomes may facilitate the retention of effector T cells in the relatively low inflammatory milieu of the secondary lymphoid organs that promotes central memory development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
