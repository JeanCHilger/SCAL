Other O-acetyl-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac(2))- or 4-O-acetyl-5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu4Ac5Gc)-containing α2–3-sialosides have also been synthesized in preparative scale. Used as an effective probe, Neu4,5Ac(2)α3GalβpNP was found to be a suitable substrate by human influenza A viruses but not bacterial sialidases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
