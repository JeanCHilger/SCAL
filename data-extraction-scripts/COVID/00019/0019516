ACE2 is important in understanding the balance between AngII and Ang-(1â€“7) and how this balance could then in turn influence hypertension or other disease outcomes. Here we describe a method to measure ACE2 activity in abdominal aorta of hyperlipidemic mice under both saline and AngII infusion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
