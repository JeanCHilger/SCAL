However, during acute viral lower respiratory infection (LRI), lung T(CD8) are functionally impaired and do not optimally control viral replication. T cells also become unresponsive to antigen during chronic infections and cancer via signaling by inhibitory receptors like programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). PD-1 also contributes to T(CD8) impairment during viral LRI, but how it regulates T(CD8) impairment and the connection between this state and T cell exhaustion during chronic infections is unknown. Here we show that PD-1 operates in a cell-intrinsic manner to impair lung T(CD8). In light of this, we compared global gene expression profiles of impaired epitope-specific lung T(CD8) to functional spleen T(CD8) in the same human metapneumovirus (HMPV)-infected mice. These two populations differentially regulate hundreds of genes, including the upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors by lung T(CD8). We then compared the gene expression of T(CD8) during HMPV infection to those in acute or chronic LCMV infection. We find that the immunophenotype of lung T(CD8) more closely resembles T cell exhaustion late into chronic infection than functional effector T cells arising early in acute infection. Finally, we demonstrate that trafficking to the infected lung alone is insufficient for T(CD8) impairment or inhibitory receptor upregulation, but that viral antigen-induced TCR signaling is also required. Our results indicate that viral antigen in infected lungs rapidly induces an exhaustion-like state in lung T(CD8), characterized by progressive functional impairment and upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
