Considerable effort over recent years has led to a detailed understanding of the self-assembly process of coiled coils, and a diverse collection of strategies have been developed for designing functional materials using this motif. The ability to engineer the interface between coiled coils allows one to achieve variously connected components, leading to precisely defined structures such as nanofibers, nanotubes, nanoparticles, networks, gels, and combinations of these. Currently these materials are being developed for a range of biotechnological and medical applications, including drug delivery systems for controlled release, targeted nanomaterials, “drug-free” therapeutics, vaccine delivery systems, and others.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
