The viral fusion (F) protein plays critical roles in infection, promoting both the viral-cell membrane fusion events needed for viral entry as well as cell-cell fusion events leading to syncytia formation. We describe the surprising finding that addition of the short epitope HA tag to the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the Hendra virus F protein leads to a significant increase in cell-cell membrane fusion. This increase was not due to alterations in surface expression, cleavage state, or association with lipid microdomains. Addition of a Myc tag of similar length did not alter Hendra F fusion activity, indicating that the observed stimulation was not solely a result of lengthening the CT. Three tyrosine residues within the HA tag were critical for the increase in fusion, suggesting C-terminal tyrosines may modulate Hendra fusion activity. The effects of HA tag addition varied with other fusion proteins, as parainfluenza virus 5 F-HA showed decreased surface expression and no stimulation in fusion. These results indicate that additions to the C-terminal end of the F protein CT can modulate protein function in a sequence specific manner, reinforcing the need for careful analysis of epitope tagged glycoproteins. In addition, our results implicate C-terminal tyrosine residues in modulation of the membrane fusion reaction promoted by these viral glycoproteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
