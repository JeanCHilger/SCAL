<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2001-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Respiratory Viral Infections among Pediatric Inpatients and Outpatients in Taiwan from 1997 to 1999</TITLE><BODY>The present study examined the association of specific virus infections with acute respiratory tract conditions among hospitalized and outpatient children in a subtropical country. A total of 2,295 virus infections were detected in 6,986 patients between 1997 and 1999, including infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (1.7%), parainfluenza virus (2.0%), influenza B virus (2.6%), adenovirus (4.0%), herpes simplex virus type 1 (4.4%), influenza A virus (5.5%), and enterovirus (12.7%). There were 61 mixed infections, and no consistent seasonal variation was found. One or more viruses were detected among 24.8% of hospitalized patients and 35.0% of outpatients. The frequencies and profiles of detection of various viruses among in- and outpatients were different. The occurrence of enterovirus infections exceeded that of other viral infections detected in 1998 and 1999 due to outbreaks of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A10. RSV was the most prevalent virus detected among hospitalized children, whereas influenza virus was the most frequently isolated virus in the outpatient group. Most respiratory viral infections (39.3%) occurred in children between 1 and 3 years old. RSV (P < 0.025) and influenza A virus (P < 0.05) infections were dominant in the male inpatient group. In addition, most pneumonia and bronchiolitis (48.4%) was caused by RSV among hospitalized children less than 6 months old. Adenovirus was the most common agent associated with pharyngitis and tonsilitis (45.5%). These data expand our understanding of the etiology of acute respiratory tract viral infections among in- and outpatients in a subtropical country and may contribute to the prevention and control of viral respiratory tract infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
