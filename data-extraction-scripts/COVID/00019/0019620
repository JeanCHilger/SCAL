<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-09-09</DATELINE><TITLE>CD23/FcεRII: molecular multi-tasking</TITLE><BODY>CD23 is the low-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin (Ig)E and plays important roles in the regulation of IgE responses. CD23 can be cleaved from cell surfaces to yield a range of soluble CD23 (sCD23) proteins that have pleiotropic cytokine-like activities. The regions of CD23 responsible for interaction with many of its known ligands, including IgE, CD21, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and integrins, have been identified and help to explain the structure–function relationships within the CD23 protein. Translational studies of CD23 underline its credibility as a target for therapeutic intervention strategies and illustrate its involvement in mediating therapeutic effects of antibodies directed at other targets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
