<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-04-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Immunobiology of Long Noncoding RNAs</TITLE><BODY>The discovery of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) has provided a new perspective on gene regulation in diverse biological contexts. lncRNAs are remarkably versatile molecules that interact with RNA, DNA or proteins to promote or restrain expression of protein-coding genes. Activation of immune cells is associated with dynamic changes in gene expression, the products of which combat infectious microorganisms, initiate repair and resolve inflammatory responses in cells and tissues. Recent evidence indicates that lncRNAs play important roles in directing the development of diverse immune cells and controlling the dynamic transcriptional programs that are a hallmark of immune cell activation. The importance of these molecules is underscored by their newly recognized roles in inflammatory diseases. In this review, we discuss the contribution of lncRNAs to immune cell lineage development, immune cell activation and immune related diseases. We also discuss the challenges faced in identifying biological functions for this large and complex class of genes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
