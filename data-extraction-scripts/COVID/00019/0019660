The titer of SeV/ΔM carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene in place of the M gene was 7 × 10(7) cell infectious units/ml or more. The new vector showed high levels of infectivity and gene expression, similar to those of wild-type SeV vector, in vitro and in vivo. Virus maturation into a particle was almost completely abolished in cells infected with SeV/ΔM. Instead, SeV/ΔM infection brought about a significant increase of syncytium formation under conditions in which the fusion protein was proteolytically cleaved and activated by trypsin-like protease. This shows that SeV/ΔM spreads markedly to neighboring cells in a cell-to-cell manner, because both hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and active fusion proteins are present at very high levels on the surface of cells infected with SeV/ΔM. Thus, SeV/ΔM is a novel type of vector with the characteristic features of loss of virus particle formation and gain of cell-to-cell spreading via a mechanism dependent on the activation of the fusion protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
