Because of this, it is speculated that children vaccinated with various childhood vaccines might develop cross immunity against SARS‐CoV. Antisera and T cells from mice immunised with various vaccines were used to determine whether they developed cross reactivity against SARS‐CoV. The results showed no marked cross reactivity against SARS‐CoV, which implies that the reduced symptoms among children infected by SARS‐CoV may be caused by other factors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
