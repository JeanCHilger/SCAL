METHODS: HRCT findings of 70 patients with presumed or laboratory-confirmed novel S-OIV infection were reviewed. The pattern (consolidation, ground glass, fibrosis and air trapping), distribution and extent of abnormality of the lesions on the HRCT were evaluated at different time points. To assess changes that occurred over time, the CT scans in 56 patients were examined in sequence. RESULTS: The most common CT findings in patients with S-OIV infection are ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation at the first week. The abnormalities peaked at the second week and resolved after that time, which resulted in substantial reduced residual disease at 4 weeks or later. The development of fibrosis was noted in the first week and peaked at the third week of illness (34.7%), then decreased slowly after that time. The mean time of air trapping being noted after the onset of symptoms was 55.5Â±20.6 days. Comparing the findings of initial CT, most results (96.4%) of follow-up chest CT findings showed improvement (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The abnormalities of ground-glass opacities and/or consolidation on initial CT scans tended to resolve to fibrosis, which then resolved completely or displayed substantially reduced residual disease. HRCT may show more changes in disease progression and play an important role in the evaluation of severe S-OIV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
