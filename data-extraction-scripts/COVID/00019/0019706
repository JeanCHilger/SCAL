PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 165 children who had a nasal wash culture positive for PIV at our institution between 1998 and 2008. Nasal wash samples were assayed for 26 inflammatory mediators using Luminex bead proteomics. RESULTS: 153 patients, ages 2 weeks to 12 years, with single virus infection were included in our final analysis. 52 patients were infected with PIV1, 19 with PIV2, 74 with PIV3, and 8 with PIV4. LRTI was diagnosed in 67 (44%) patients, 21 (14%) had LTB, and 49 (32%) had a URI other than LTB. LRTI was diagnosed in 54% of patients infected with PIV3, 35% of those infected with PIV1, 26% of those with PIV2 and 50% of those with PIV4. Compared to uninfected control patients, PIV-infected patients had higher nasal wash concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CXCL9 (monokine induced by interferon gamma (MIG) and CCL5 (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Patients with LRTI, moderate or severe illness, and respirovirus infection (PIV 1 or 3) had higher nasal wash concentrations of CXCL8 when compared to patients with URI, mild illness, or rubulavirus infection (PIV 2 and 4) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PIV infection causes a spectrum of illnesses associated with the expression and release of several proinflammatory mediators. Of note, elevated levels of CXCL8 in nasal wash samples are associated with more severe forms of PIV disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
