The spikes, which are composed of three E2 and E1 glycoprotein heterodimers, are responsible for receptor binding and mediating fusion between the viral and host-cell membranes during entry. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of E2 interacts with the nucleocapsid core during the last stages of particle assembly, possibly to aid in particle stability. During assembly, the spikes are nonfusogenic until the E3 glycoprotein is cleaved from E2 in the trans-Golgi network. Thus, a mutation in E2 potentially has effects on virus entry, spike assembly, or spike maturation. E2 is a highly conserved, cysteine-rich transmembrane glycoprotein. We made single cysteine-to-serine mutations within two distinct regions of the E2 ectodomain in both Sindbis virus and Ross River virus. Each of the E2 Cys mutants produced fewer infectious particles than wild-type virus. Further characterization of the mutant viruses revealed differences in particle morphology, fusion activity, and polyprotein cleavage between Sindbis and Ross River virus mutants, despite the mutations being made at corresponding positions in E2. The nonconserved assembly defects suggest that E2 folding and function is species dependent, possibly due to interactions with a virus-specific chaperone.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
