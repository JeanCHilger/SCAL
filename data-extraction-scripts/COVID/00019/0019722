Animals vaccinated with vectors expressing either strain A/Hong Kong/156/1997 or strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5 hemagglutinin (HA) were able to generate robust NAb responses. The ability of the vectors to induce NAbs against homologous and heterologous AIVs after a single dose was dependent upon the HA antigen incorporated into the VSV vaccine. The vectors expressing strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5 HA were superior to those expressing strain A/Hong Kong/156/1997 HA at inducing cross-clade NAbs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
