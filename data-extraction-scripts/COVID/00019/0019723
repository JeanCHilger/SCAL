<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Simultaneous Intranasal/Intravascular Antibody Labeling of CD4(+) T Cells in Mouse Lungs</TITLE><BODY>CD4(+) T cell responses have been shown to be protective in many respiratory virus infections. In the respiratory tract, CD4(+) T cells include cells in the airway and parenchyma and cells adhering to the pulmonary vasculature. Here we discuss in detail the methods that are useful for characterizing CD4(+) T cells in different anatomic locations in mouse lungs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
