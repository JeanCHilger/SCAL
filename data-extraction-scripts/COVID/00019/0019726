<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-09-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 and Blood-Brain Barrier</TITLE><BODY>Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is a dynamic structure that maintains the homeostasis of the brain and thus proper neurological functions. BBB compromise has been found in many pathological conditions, including neuroinflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), a chemokine that is transiently and significantly up-regulated during inflammation, is able to disrupt the integrity of BBB and modulate the progression of various diseases, including excitotoxic injury and hemorrhage. In this review, we first introduce the biochemistry and biology of MCP1, and then summarize the effects of MCP1 on BBB integrity as well as individual BBB components.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
