Here, in vivo and in vitro experiments were undertaken to elucidate the role of these Bregs in controlling neuroinflammation following viral brain infection. We used multi-color flow cytometry to phenotype lymphocyte subpopulations infiltrating the brain, along with in vitro co-cultures to assess their anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory roles. This distinctive subset of CD19(+)CD1d(hi)CD5(+) B-cells was found to infiltrate the brains of chronically infected animals, reaching highest levels at the latest time point tested (30 d p.i.). B-cell-deficient Jh(−/−) mice were found to develop exacerbated neuroimmune responses as measured by enhanced accumulation and/or retention of CD8(+) T-cells within the brain, as well as increased levels of microglial activation (MHC class II). Conversely, levels of Foxp3(+) regulatory T-cells (Tregs) were found to be significantly lower in Jh(−/−) mice when compared to wild-type (Wt) animals. Further experiments showed that in vitro generated IL-10-secreting regulatory B-cells (B10) were able to inhibit cytokine responses from microglia following stimulation with viral antigens. These in vitro generated B10 cells were also found to promote proliferation of regulatory T-cells in co-culture studies. Finally, gain of function experiments demonstrated that reconstitution of Wt B-cells into Jh(−/−) mice restored neuroimmune responses to levels exhibited by infected Wt mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that regulatory B-cells modulate T lymphocyte as well as microglial cell responses within the infected brain and promote CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T-cell proliferation in vitro.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
