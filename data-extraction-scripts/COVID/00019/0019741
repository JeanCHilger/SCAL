An exploration of the season of conception in relation to preterm birth may provide direction in the search for risk factors. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 82 213 singleton livebirths (20–45 weeks’ gestation) to 61 630 women at Magee-Womens Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA, from 1995 to 2005. Conception was estimated based on gestational age determined by best obstetric estimate. Fourier series analysis was used to model seasonal trends. Spontaneous preterm birth at <37 weeks was associated with conception season (P < 0.05). The peak prevalence occurred among conceptions in winter and spring (peaking February 23 at 6.9%), with an average trough among late summer/early autumn conceptions (August 25 at 6.2%). The pattern for spontaneous preterm birth <32 weeks was similar (P < 0.05), with the peak on March 13 (1.7%), and nadir on September 12 (1.4%). Results were similar when indicated preterm births were included. These seasonal changes may increase our insight into the role of exposures with seasonal periodicity in the pathophysiology of preterm birth.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
