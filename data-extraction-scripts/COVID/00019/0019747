In turn, the host expresses anti-viral restriction factors to defend against infection. To find host-cell modifiers of influenza A H1N1 viral infection, we used a functional genomic screen and identified over 120 influenza A virus-dependency factors with roles in endosomal acidification, vesicular trafficking, mitochondrial metabolism and RNA splicing. We discovered that the interferon-inducible trans-membrane proteins, IFITM1, 2 and 3, restrict an early step in influenza A viral replication. The IFITM proteins confer basal resistance to influenza A virus, but are also inducible by interferons type I and II, and are critical for interferon's virustatic actions. Further characterization revealed that the IFITM proteins inhibit the early replication of flaviviruses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus. Collectively this work identifies a new family of anti-viral restriction factors that mediate cellular resistance to at least three major human pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
