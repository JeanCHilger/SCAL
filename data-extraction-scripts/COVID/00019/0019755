During plasma exchange, the plasma cytokines interferon-α and inducible protein-10 gradually decreased without change of plasma viral load. However, plasma viral load gradually decreased after convalescent plasma therapy. This case provides important insights for understanding the mechanisms of experimental therapy in severely affected SFTS patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
