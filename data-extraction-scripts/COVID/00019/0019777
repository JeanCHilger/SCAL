<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-11-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Recombinant Canine Coronaviruses Related to Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus of Swine Are Circulating in Dogs</TITLE><BODY>Four canine coronavirus type II (CCoV-II) strains were identified in the guts and internal organs of pups which had died of acute gastroenteritis. The CCoV-II strains were strictly related to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, whereas in the other parts of the genome, a higher genetic relatedness to recent CCoV-II isolates was observed. Experimental infection of dogs with a TGEV-like isolate induced mild gastroenteritis without any systemic involvement. By virus neutralization tests, antigenic differences between reference and TGEV-like CCoVs were found. Our data support the potential recombinant origin of the TGEV-like CCoVs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
