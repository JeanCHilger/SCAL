<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-03-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Receptor Usage and Cell Entry of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>Porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) has significantly damaged America's pork industry. Here we investigate the receptor usage and cell entry of PEDV. PEDV recognizes protein receptor aminopeptidase N from pig and human and sugar coreceptor N-acetylneuraminic acid. Moreover, PEDV infects cells from pig, human, monkey, and bat. These results support the idea of bats as an evolutionary origin for PEDV, implicate PEDV as a potential threat to other species, and suggest antiviral strategies to control its spread.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
