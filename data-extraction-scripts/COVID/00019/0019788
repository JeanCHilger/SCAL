An ideal prophylactic vaccine should mimic the natural immunity induced by an infection, in that it should generate long-lasting adaptive immunity. To complement subunit vaccines, which primarily target an antibody response, different methodologies are being investigated to develop vaccines capable of driving cellular immunity. T-cell epitope discovery is central to this concept. In this review, the significance of T-cell epitope-based vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic applications is discussed. Additionally, methodologies for the discovery of T-cell epitopes, as well as recent developments in the clinical testing of these vaccines for various viral infections, are explained.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
