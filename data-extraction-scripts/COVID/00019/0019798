<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-08-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Detection of an Antigenic Group 2 Coronavirus in an Adult Alpaca with Enteritis</TITLE><BODY>Antigenic group 2 coronavirus was detected in a fecal sample of an adult alpaca by reverse transcription-PCR. The presence of alpaca coronavirus (ApCoV) in the small intestine was demonstrated by immune histochemistry with an antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibody that reacts with group 2 coronaviruses. Other common causes of diarrhea in adult camelids were not detected. We conclude that nutritional stress may have predisposed the alpaca to severe ApCoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
