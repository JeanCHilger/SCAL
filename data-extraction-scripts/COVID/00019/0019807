While infection of humans remains inefficient, many of those with H5N1 disease have a rapidly progressing viral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death but its pathogenesis remains an enigma. Comparisons in the virology and pathogenesis of human seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) and H5N1 in patients, animal models and in relevant primary human cell cultures remains instructive. While the direct effects of viral replication and differences in the tropism of the virus for cells in the lower respiratory tract clearly contribute to the pathogenesis, we focus here on the possible contribution of the host innate immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
