Co‐inhibitory receptor ligands are highly expressed by a variety of malignancies allowing evasion of anti‐tumour immunity. Recent studies demonstrate that manipulation of these co‐inhibitory pathways can remove the immunological brakes that impede endogenous immune responses against tumours. Antibodies that block the interactions between co‐inhibitory receptors and their ligands have delivered very promising clinical responses, as has been shown by recent successful trials targeting the CTLA‐4 and PD‐1 pathways. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action and expression pattern of co‐inhibitory receptors on different T cells subsets, emphasising differences between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We also summarise recent clinical findings utilising immune checkpoint blockade.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
