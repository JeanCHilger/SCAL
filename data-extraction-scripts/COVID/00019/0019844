Infection is the major cause of metabolic decompensation in patients with IEM. We hypothesized that activation of the immune system during infection leads to further perturbations in end-organ metabolism resulting in increased morbidity. To address this, we established model systems of metabolic decompensation due to infection. Using these systems, we have described the pathologic mechanisms of metabolic decompensation as well as changes in hepatic metabolic reserve associated with infection. First and foremost, our studies have demonstrated that the liver experiences a significant local innate immune response during influenza infection that modulates hepatic metabolism. Based on these findings, we are the first to suggest that the role of the liver as a metabolic and immunologic organ is central in the pathophysiology of metabolic decompensation due to infection in IEM. The dual function of the liver as a major metabolic regulator and a lymphoid organ responsible for immunosurveillance places this organ at risk for hepatotoxicity. Mobilization of hepatic reserve and the regenerative capacity of a healthy liver compensates for this calculated risk. However, activation of the hepatic innate immune system may be deleterious in IEM. Based on this assertion, strategies aimed at modulating the innate immune response may be a viable target for intervention in the treatment of hepatic metabolic decompensation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
