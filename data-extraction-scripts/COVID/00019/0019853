We examined the expression variations of a set of eight candidate reference genes in tomato leaf and root tissues subjected to the infection of five taxonomically and molecularly different plant viruses and a viroid, inducing diverse pathogenic effects on inoculated plants. Parallel analyses by three commonly used dedicated algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, showed that different viral infections and tissues of origin influenced, to some extent, the expression levels of these genes. However, all algorithms showed high levels of stability for glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin, indicated as the most suitable endogenous transcripts for normalization in both tissue types. Actin and uridylate kinase were also stably expressed throughout the infected tissues, whereas cyclophilin showed tissue‐specific expression stability only in root samples. By contrast, two widely employed reference genes, 18S ribosomal RNA and elongation factor 1α, demonstrated highly variable expression levels that should discourage their use for normalization. In addition, expression level analysis of ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase showed the modulation of the two genes in virus‐infected tomato leaves and roots. The relative quantification of the two genes varied according to the reference genes selected, thus highlighting the importance of the choice of the correct normalization method in such experiments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
