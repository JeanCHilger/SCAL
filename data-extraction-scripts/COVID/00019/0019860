This mutation reduced VP26 expression and mislocalized VP26 and its binding partner, the major capsid protein VP5, in the nucleus. VP5 mislocalization was also observed with the VP26 null mutation. Thus, we postulate that phosphorylation of VP26 at Thr-111 regulates VP26 function in vitro and in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
