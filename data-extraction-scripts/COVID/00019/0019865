MAV-1 infects endothelial cells throughout the mouse, and monocytes/macrophages have also been implicated as targets of the virus. Here we determined the extent and functional importance of macrophage infection by MAV-1. Bone marrow-derived macrophages expressed MAV-1 mRNAs and proteins upon ex vivo infection. Adherent peritoneal macrophages from infected mice expressed viral mRNAs and produced infectious virus. Infected chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) knockout mice, which are defective for macrophage recruitment, did not show differences in survival or MAV-1 load compared to controls. In contrast, macrophage depletion using clodronate-loaded liposomes resulted in increased virus replication in spleens of a MAV-1-resistant mouse strain, BALB/cJ. Thus macrophages serve both as targets of infection and as effectors of the host response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
