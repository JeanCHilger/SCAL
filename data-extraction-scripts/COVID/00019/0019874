We used this platform to display a tandem repeat of the B cell immunodominant repeat epitope (DPPPPNPN)(2)D of the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Administered in saline, without the need for a heterologous adjuvant, the SAPN construct P4c-Mal conferred a long lived protective immune response to mice with a broad range of genetically distinct immune backgrounds including the H-2(b), H-2(d) and H-2(k) alleles. Immunized mice produced a CD4(+) T cell dependent, high titer, long lasting, high avidity antibody response against the B cell epitope. Mice were protected against an initial challenge of parasites given up to 6 months after the last immunization or for up to 15 months against a second challenge after an initial challenge of parasites had successfully been cleared. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SAPN platform not only functions to deliver an ordered repetitive array of B cell peptide epitopes but operates as a classical immunological carrier to provide cognate help to the P4c-Mal specific B cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
