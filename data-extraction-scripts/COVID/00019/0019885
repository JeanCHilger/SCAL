RLRs are cytosolic sensors for virus-derived RNA and thus responsible for intracellular immune surveillance against infection. RLR signaling requires the adapter protein MAVS to induce type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines. This review focusses on the molecular and cell biological requirements for RLR signal transduction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
