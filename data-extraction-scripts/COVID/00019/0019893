The prevalence of 15 opportunistic microbes in a murine research facility was determined by yearlong PCR-based murine and IVC equipment surveillance comprising 1738 specimens. Of the 8 microbes detected, 3 organisms—Staphylococcus xylosus, Proteus mirabilis, and Pasteurella pneumotropica biotype Heyl—were most prevalent in both murine and IVC exhaust plenum specimens. Overall, the 8 detectable microbes were more readily PCR-detectable in IVC exhaust airways than in murine specimens, supporting the utility of PCR testing of IVC exhaust airways as a component of immunodeficient murine health surveillance. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) exposure of IVC equipment left unassembled (that is, in a ‘static-open’ configuration) did not eliminate PCR detectable evidence of microbes. In contrast, VHP exposure of IVC equipment assembled ‘active-closed’ eliminated PCR-detectable evidence of all microbes. Ensuring data integrity and maintaining a topographically complex immunodeficient murine research environment is facilitated by knowing the prevalent opportunistic microbes to be monitored and by implementing a PCR-validated method of facility decontamination that mitigates opportunistic microbes and the risk of invalidation of studies involving immunodeficient mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
