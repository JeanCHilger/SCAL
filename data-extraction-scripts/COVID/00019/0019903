Innate and adaptive immune responses to viruses are also greatly influenced by IFN-I. In this article we discuss the diversity of cellular sources of IFN-I and the pathways leading to IFN-I production during viral infections. Finally, we discuss the effects of IFN-I on cells of the immune system with emphasis on dendritic cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
