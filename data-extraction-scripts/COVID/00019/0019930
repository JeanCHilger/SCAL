Several delivery methods, such as intramuscular (i.m.) injection, intramuscular injection plus electroporation (i.m.-EP), and intradermal injection plus electroporation (i.d.-EP) were used in a murine model to analyze and compare the immune responses that were induced by the DNA immunogens. We found that i.d.-EP accelerated specific antibody seroconversion and produced high antibody (anti-PreS1, anti-S, and anti-C antibody) titers after HBSS1 and HBCS1 immunization. Combining the HBSS1 and HBCS1 DNA immunogens with i.d.-EP produced the strongest multiantigen (PreS1, S, and C)-specific cellular immune response and the highest specific PreS1 antibody levels. The results indicated that DNA immunization using HBSS1 and HBCS1 might be an ideal candidate, with its ability to elicit robust B and T cell immune responses against multiantigen when combined with optimized delivery technology. The present study provides a basis for the design and rational application of a novel HBV DNA vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
