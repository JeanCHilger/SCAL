In Canada, although most public health management of communicable diseases occurs at the front line, the federal government also takes actions to prevent and mitigate their importation. OBJECTIVE: To describe the role of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in minimizing the importation of communicable diseases through preventive measures taken before travellers leave Canada and through early detection and prompt containment measures taken when travellers arrive in the country with a potential communicable disease. INTERVENTIONS: PHAC works to minimize the importation of communicable diseases into Canada by developing evidence-based travel health advice and targeted outreach activities geared to the public and to health care professionals. On the basis of the Quarantine Act and the International Health Regulations (2005), PHAC also conducts inspections of conveyances such as aircraft and boats and works with partners to conduct border screening to assess ill travellers entering the country. CONCLUSION: PHAC plays an important role in preventing and minimizing the importation of communicable diseases into Canada in conjunction with clinicians, public health authorities at all levels of government and other federal government departments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
