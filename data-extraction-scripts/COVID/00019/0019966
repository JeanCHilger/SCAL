<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-10-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular Requirements for T Cell Recognition of N-Myristoylated Peptides Derived from the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Nef Protein</TITLE><BODY>We have recently isolated a rhesus macaque cytotoxic T cell line, 2N5.1, that specifically recognizes an N-myristoylated 5-mer peptide (C(14)-Gly-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser [C14nef5]) derived from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef protein. Such C14nef5-specific T cells expand in the circulation of SIV-infected monkeys, underscoring the capacity of T cells to recognize viral lipopeptides; however, the molecular basis for the lipopeptide antigen presentation remains to be elucidated. Here, functional studies indicated that the putative antigen-presenting molecule for 2N5.1 was likely to have two separate antigen-binding sites, one for interaction with a C(14)-saturated acyl chain and the other for anchorage of the C-terminal serine residue. Mutants with alanine substitutions for the second glycine residue and the fourth isoleucine residue were not recognized by 2N5.1 but interfered with the presentation of C14nef5 to 2N5.1, indicating that these structural analogues retained the ability to interact with the antigen-presenting molecules. In contrast to the highly specific recognition of C14nef5 by 2N5.1, an additional cytotoxic T cell line, SN45, established independently from a C14nef5-stimulated T cell culture, showed superb reactivity to both C14nef5 and an N-myristoylated Nef 4-mer peptide, and therefore, the C-terminal serine residue was dispensable for the recognition of lipopeptides by the SN45 T cells. Furthermore, the mutants with alanine substitutions were indeed recognized by the SN45 T cells. Given that N-myristoylation of the Nef protein occurs in the conserved motifs and is critical for viral pathogenesis, these observations predict that the lipopeptide-specific T cell response is difficult for viruses to avoid by simply introducing amino acid mutations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
