We previously found that overexpression of PDI in rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells suppresses 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T(3))-stimulated growth hormone (GH) expression, suggesting the contribution of PDI to the T(3)-mediated gene expression via thyroid hormone receptor (TR). In the present study, we have clarified the mechanism of regulation by which TR function is regulated by PDI. Overexpression of wild-type but not redox-inactive mutant PDI suppressed the T(3)-induced GH expression, suggesting that the redox activity of PDI contributes to the suppression of GH. We considered that PDI regulates the redox state of the TR and focused on redox factor-1 (Ref-1) as a mediator of the redox regulation of TR by PDI. Interaction between Ref-1 and TRβ1 was detected. Overexpression of wild-type but not C64S Ref-1 facilitated the GH expression, suggesting that redox activity of Cys-64 in Ref-1 is involved in the TR-mediated gene expression. Moreover, PDI interacted with Ref-1 and changed the redox state of Ref-1, suggesting that PDI controls the redox state of Ref-1. Our studies suggested that Ref-1 contributes to TR-mediated gene expression and that the redox state of Ref-1 is regulated by PDI. Redox regulation of PDI via Ref-1 is a new aspect of PDI function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
