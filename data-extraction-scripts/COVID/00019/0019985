<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-11-21</DATELINE><TITLE>CEACAM1 loss links inflammation to Insulin Resistance in obesity and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)</TITLE><BODY>Mounting epidemiological evidence points to an association between metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an increasingly recognized new epidemic. NASH pathologies include hepatocellular ballooning, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular injury, apoptosis and hepatic fibrosis. We will review the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation in visceral obesity and NASH in an attempt to shed more light on the pathogenesis of these major metabolic diseases. Moreover, we will identify loss of the Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 as a unifying mechanism linking the immunological and metabolic abnormalities in NASH.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
