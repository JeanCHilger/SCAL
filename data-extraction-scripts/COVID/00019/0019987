Previously, we reported that vitamin C is transported into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) through the sodium dependent Vitamin C Transporter 2 (SVCT2) and this transporter plays an important role in osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, this transporter is regulated by oxidative stress. To date, however, the exact role of vitamin C and its transporter (SVCT2) in ROS regulated autophagy and apoptosis in BMSCs is poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that oxidative stress decreased survival of BMSCs in a dose-dependent manner and induced growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These effects were accompanied by the induction of autophagy, confirmed by P62 and LC3B protein level and punctate GFPâ€“LC3B distribution. The supplementation of vitamin C significantly rescued the BMSCs from oxidative stress by regulating autophagy. Knockdown of the SVCT2 transporter in BMSCs synergistically decreased cell survival even under low oxidative stress conditions. Also, supplementing vitamin C failed to rescue cells from stress. Our results reveal that the SVCT2 transporter plays a vital role in the mechanism of BMSC survival under stress conditions. Altogether, this study has given new insight into the role of the SVCT2 transporter in oxidative stress related autophagy and apoptosis in BMSCs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
