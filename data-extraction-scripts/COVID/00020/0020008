In contrast, APMV-2 is avirulent in chickens. We investigated the role of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) envelope glycoproteins in these contrasting phenotypes by designing chimeric viruses in which the F and HN glycoproteins or their ectodomains were exchanged individually or together between the moderately virulent, neurotropic NDV strain Beaudette C (BC) and the avirulent APMV-2 strain Yucaipa. When we attempted to exchange the complete F and HN glycoproteins individually and together between the two viruses, the only construct that could be recovered was recombinant APMV-2 strain Yucaipa (rAPMV-2), containing the NDV F glycoprotein in place of its own. This substitution of NDV F into APMV-2 was sufficient to confer the neurotropic, neuroinvasive, and neurovirulent phenotypes, in spite of all being at reduced levels compared to what was seen for NDV-BC. When the ectodomains of F and HN were exchanged individually and together, two constructs could be recovered: NDV, containing both the F and HN ectodomains of APMV-2; and APMV-2, containing both ectodomains of NDV. This supported the idea that homologous cytoplasmic tails and matched F and HN ectodomains are important for virus replication. Analysis of these viruses for replication in vitro, syncytium formation, mean embryo death time, intracerebral pathogenicity index, and replication and tropism in 1-day-old chicks and 2-week-old chickens showed that the two contrasting phenotypes of NDV and APMV-2 could largely be transferred between the two backbones by transfer of homotypic F and HN ectodomains. Further analysis provided evidence that the homologous stalk domain of NDV HN is essential for virus replication, while the globular head domain of NDV HN could be replaced with that of APMV-2 with only a minimal attenuating effect. These results demonstrate that the F and HN ectodomains together determine the cell fusion, tropism, and virulence phenotypes of NDV and APMV-2 and that the regions of HN that are critical to replication and the species-specific phenotypes include the cytoplasmic tail and stalk domain but not the globular head domain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
