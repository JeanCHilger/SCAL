The native fold not only conveys activity, but is also required for the transport of the enzyme out of the ER to the lysosome. We have shown that conventional carbohydrate-based competitive inhibitors of purified Hex also act as pharmacological chaperones (PC) in ATSD or ASD cells, overcoming to some extent the destabilizing effects of the mutation, increasing the levels of mutant Hex protein and activity in the lysosome 3–6 fold. We now report the development of a fluorescence-based real-time enzyme assay suitable for high throughput screening of the Maybridge library of 50,000 drug-like compounds to identify novel inhibitors (hits) of purified human Hex. Each hit was then evaluated as a PC in a cell-based assay. Three structurally distinct compounds, a bisnaphthalimide, a nitro-indan-1-one, and a pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-1-one were identified as micromolar competitive inhibitors of the enzyme that also specifically increased the levels of lysosomal Hex protein and activity in patient fibroblasts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
