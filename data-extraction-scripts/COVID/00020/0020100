<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-06-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Towards RNA Nanoparticle Vaccines: Synergizing RNA and Inorganic Nanoparticles to Achieve Immuno-potentiation</TITLE><BODY>Traditionally, vaccines have been composed of live attenuated or killed micro-organisms. Alternatively, individual protein subunits or other molecular components of the micro-organism can serve as the antigen and trigger an antibody response by the immune system. The immune system is a coordinated molecular and cellular response that works in concert to check the spread of infection. In the past decade, there has been much progress on DNA vaccines. DNA vaccination includes using the coding segments of a viral or bacterial genome to generate an immune response. However, the potential advantage of combining an RNA molecule with inorganic nanoparticle delivery should be considered, with the goal to achieve immuno-synergy between the two and to overcome some of the current limitations of DNA vaccines and traditional vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
