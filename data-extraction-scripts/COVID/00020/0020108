Several of the novel amines displayed low-micromolar activities against an amantadine-resistant H1N1 strain, but they did not show activity against an amantadine-sensitive H3N2 strain. None of the tested compounds inhibit the influenza A/M2 proton channel function. Most of the compounds did not show cytotoxicity for MDCK cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
