The movement of nucleostemin between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm provides a dynamic way to partition the nucleostemin protein between these two compartments. Here, we showed that nucleostemin contained two nucleolus-targeting regions, the basic and the GTP-binding domains, which exhibited a short and a long nucleolar retention time, respectively. In a GTP-unbound state, the nucleolus-targeting activity of nucleostemin was blocked by a mechanism that trapped its intermediate domain in the nucleoplasm. A nucleostemin-interacting protein, RSL1D1, was identified that contained a ribosomal L1-domain, co-resided with nucleostemin in the same subnucleolar compartment non-identical to the B23 and fibrillarin distributions, and displayed a longer nucleolar residence time than nucleostemin. RSL1D1 interacted with both the basic and the GTP-binding domains of nucleostemin through a non-nucleolus-targeting region. Overexpression of the nucleolus-targeting domain of RSL1D1 alone dispersed the nucleolar nucleostemin. Loss of RSL1D1 expression reduced the compartmental size and amount of nucleostemin in the nucleolus. This work reveals that the partitioning of nucleostemin employs complex mechanisms involving both nucleolar and nucleoplasmic components, and provides insight into the post-translational regulation of its activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
