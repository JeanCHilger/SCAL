Descriptions of the receptors involved and the molecular mechanisms they employ to sense viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns have emerged in great detail. This review presents an overview of our current knowledge regarding the receptors used to detect RNA virus invasion, the molecular structures these receptors sense, and the involved downstream signaling pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
