However low levels of damage are often observed after freeze-drying, and this damage is more evident in dilute lipoplex preparations. By investigating the stability of lipoplexes after each step in the freeze-drying cycle (i.e., freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying) we strive to understand the mechanisms responsible for damage and identify improved stabilization strategies. N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP)-cholesterol/plasmid DNA lipoplexes were prepared at an equimolar DOTAP to cholesterol ratio, and a 3-to-1 DOTAP(+) to DNA(−) charge ratio. Our experiments indicate that despite sufficient levels of “stabilizing” sugars, significant damage is still evident when dilute lipoplex preparations are subjected to freeze-drying. Analysis of the different stages of freeze-drying suggests that significant damage occurs during freezing, and that sugars have a limited capacity to protect against this freezing-induced damage. Similar effects have been observed in studies with proteins, and surfactants have been employed in protein formulations to protect against surface-induced damage, e.g., at the ice crystal, solid, air or sugar glass surfaces. However, the use of surfactants in a lipid-based formulation is inherently risky due to the potential for altering/solubilizing the lipid delivery vehicle. Our data indicate that judicious use of surfactants can reduce surface-induced damage, and result in better preservation of lipoplex size and transfection activity after freeze-drying.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
