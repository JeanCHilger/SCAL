Nevertheless, the specific targets of these autoantibodies remain incompletely defined. During an immune response, B cells specific for the inciting antigen(s) are activated and differentiate into “plasmablasts”, which are released into the blood. In this study we sequence the plasmablast antibody repertoire to define the targets of the active immune response in RA. METHODS: We developed a novel DNA barcoding method to sequence the cognate heavy- and light-chain pairs of antibodies expressed by individual blood plasmablasts in RA. The method uses a universal 5’ adapter that enables full-length sequencing of the antibodies’ variable regions and recombinant expression of the paired antibody chains. The sequence datasets were bioinformatically analyzed to generate phylogenetic trees that identify clonal families of antibodies sharing heavy- and light-chain VJ sequences. Representative antibodies were expressed, and their binding properties characterized using CCP2 ELISA and antigen microarrays. RESULTS: We used our sequencing method to generate phylogenetic trees representing the antibody repertoires of peripheral blood plasmablasts of 4 individuals with anti-CCP(+) RA, and recombinantly expressed 14 antibodies that were either “singleton” antibodies or representative of clonal antibody families. CCP2 ELISA identified four ACPAs, and antigen microarray analysis identified ACPAs that differentially targeted epitopes on α-enolase, citrullinated fibrinogen, and citrullinated histone 2B. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that autoantibodies targeting α-enolase, citrullinated fibrinogen, and citrullinated histone 2B are produced by the ongoing activated B cell response in, and thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of, RA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
