However, the available evidence provides no insight into the possible mechanisms by which co-activation of the IFN-α/β- and IFN-γ-signaling pathways produces this effect. Therefore, it has not been possible to differentiate whether these observations represent an important in vitro model of host immunological suppression of HSV-1 infection, or an irrelevant laboratory phenomenon. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine if co-activation of the host cell’s IFN-α/β and IFN-γ pathways either (a) induces death of HSV-1 infected cells such that viral replication is unable to occur or (b) disrupts one or more steps in the process of HSV-1 replication. To this end, multiple steps in HSV-1 infection were compared in populations of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 strain KOS (MOI=2.5) and exposed to ligands of the 1. IFN-α/β receptor, 2. IFN-γ receptor, or 3. both the IFN-α/β receptor and IFN-γ receptor. The results demonstrate that IFN-β and IFN-γ interact in a synergistic manner to block the efficient synthesis of viral DNA and nucleocapsid formation in HSV-1 infected cells, and do so without adversely affecting host cell viability. We infer that IFN-mediated suppression of HSV-1 replication may be a central mechanism by which the host immune system limits the spread of HSV-1 infection in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
