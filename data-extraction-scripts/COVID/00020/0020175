Regulation of ENaC by Gα-mediated downstream effectors has been studied extensively, but the effect of G(βγ) dimers on ENaC is unclear. A6 cells endogenously contain high levels of G(β1) but low levels of G(β3), G(β4), and G(β5) were detected by Q-PCR. We tested Gγ(2) combined individually with G(β1) through G(β5) expressed in A6 cells, after which we recorded single-channel ENaC activity. Among the five β and γ(2) combinations, β(1)γ(2) strongly inhibits ENaC activity by reducing both ENaC channel number (N) and open probability (P(o)) compared with control cells. In contrast, the other four β-isoforms combined with γ(2) have no significant effect on ENaC activity. By using various inhibitors to probe G(β1γ2) effects on ENaC regulation, we found that G(β1γ2)-mediated ENaC inhibition involved activation of phospholipase C-β and its enzymatic products that induce protein kinase C and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
