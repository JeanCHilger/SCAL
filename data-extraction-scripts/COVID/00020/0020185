This SV Del6K virus is defective in the proteolytic processing of virus glycoprotein precursor, transport of glycoproteins to the plasma membrane, and plaque phenotype. A revertant virus (SV Del6K-revQ21L) containing a point mutation in the deleted 6K gene was isolated and characterized. SV Del6K-revQ21L has corrected the defects of proteolytic processing and transport of virus glycoproteins to the plasma membrane, but it still remains attenuated compared to wild-type (wt) SV, exhibiting defects in virus budding. Neither mutant nor revertant viruses are complemented by the coexpression in trans of a wt SV 6K gene.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
