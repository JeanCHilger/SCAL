In this review, we focus on the key roles played by peptides and proteins in improving, controlling, and defining the performance of nanotechnologies. Within this framework, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key sequences and structures utilised to provide biological and physical stability to nano-constructs, direct particles to their target and influence their cellular and tissue distribution, induce and control biological responses, and form polypeptide self-assembled nanoparticles. In doing so, we highlight the great advances made by the field, as well as the challenges still faced in achieving the clinical translation of peptide- and protein-functionalised nano-drug delivery vehicles, imaging species, and active therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
