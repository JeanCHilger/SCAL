We sought to define relevant correlates of disease severity in the mouse influenza model, hypothesizing that a susceptibility threshold exists for alveolar epithelial cell loss. We compared lung pathology, virus spread, alveolar epithelial cell depletion, arterial blood oxygenation, physiological responses measured by unrestrained plethysmography, and oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production by gas analysis in mice at intervals after infection with virus strains and doses that cause mild (x31) or severe (PR/8) influenza. Both mild and severe infections showed similar degrees of lung damage and virus dissemination until day 6 after inoculation but diverged in survival outcomes from day 9. Day 6 PR/8-infected mice had normal respiratory and gas exchange functions with 10% type I cell loss. However, day 10 PR/8-infected mice had 40% type I cell loss with a concomitant drastic decreases in tidal and minute volumes, V̇o(2), V̇co(2), and arterial blood oxygenation, compared with a maximum 3% type I cell loss for x31 on day 10 when they recovered body weight and respiratory functions. Alterations in breaths per minute, expiratory time, and metabolic rate were observed in both infections. A threshold for maintenance of proper respiratory function appears to be crossed once 10% of alveolar type I cells are lost. These data indicate that lethality in influenza virus infection is a matter of degree rather than quality.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
