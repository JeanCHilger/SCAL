Here we describe inhibitors of the adenovirus proteinase (AVP) with the ultimate objective of developing anti-adenovirus agents. Inhibitors were identified via structure-based drug design using as druggable sites the active site and a conserved cofactor pocket in the crystal structures of AVP. A lead compound was identified that had an IC(50) of 18 Î¼M. One of eight structural derivatives of the lead compound had an IC(50) of 140 nM against AVP and an IC(50) of 490 nM against the AVP with its cofactor bound.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
