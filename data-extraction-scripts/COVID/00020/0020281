Growth on a biomalt medium supplemented with sea salt yielded an extract from which we have isolated sclerosporin and four new hydroxylated sclerosporin derivatives, namely 15-hydroxysclerosporin (2), 12-hydroxysclerosporin (3), 11-hydroxysclerosporin (4) and 8-hydroxysclerosporin (5). The compounds were evaluated in various biological activity assays. Compound 5 showed a weak fat-accumulation inhibitory activity against 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
