For at least two tRNAs that could pair with both the resume and −2 triplets on mutant tmRNAs, UAA (stop) as the second codon induced high-frequency −2 slippage on the resume codon in the P site. The frameshift product was not detected when the −2 base was altered. Deficiency for ribosomal L9 protein, which affects other cases of frameshifting, had no significant effect. A special feature of this frameshifting is its dependence on a particular context, that of the tmRNA resume codon; it failed on the same sequence in a regular mRNA, and, more strikingly, at the second tmRNA codon. This focuses attention on the peculiar features expected of the slippage-prone state, such as unusual E-site filling, that might make the P-site resume codon:anticodon interaction especially unstable.
