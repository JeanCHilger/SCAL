The nonstructural protein encoded in the N-terminal region of the first open reading frame (ORF1) of the Norwalk virus genome is analogous in gene order to proteins 2A and 2B of the picornaviruses; the latter is known for its membrane-associated activities. Confocal microscopy imaging of cells transfected with a vector plasmid that provided expression of the entire Norwalk virus N-terminal protein (amino acids 1 to 398 of the ORF1 polyprotein) showed colocalization of this protein with cellular proteins of the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, this colocalization was characteristically associated with a visible disassembly of the Golgi complex into discrete aggregates. Deletion of a predicted hydrophobic region (amino acids 360 to 379) in a potential 2B-like (2BL) region (amino acids 301 to 398) near the C terminus of the Norwalk virus N-terminal protein reduced Golgi colocalization and disassembly. Confocal imaging was conducted to examine the expression characteristics of fusion proteins in which the 2BL region from the N-terminal protein of Norwalk virus (a genogroup I norovirus) or MD145 (a genogroup II norovirus) was fused to the C terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Expression of each fusion protein in cells showed evidence for its colocalization with the Golgi apparatus. These data indicate that the N-terminal protein of Norwalk virus interacts with the Golgi apparatus and may play a 2BL role in the induction of intracellular membrane rearrangements associated with positive-strand RNA virus replication in cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
