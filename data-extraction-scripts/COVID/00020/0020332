A sensitive and rapid molecular assay to detect the plasmid bla(NDM-1) in clinical isolates is needed to control its spread. We describe a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of bla(NDM-1) from pure culture and sputum, urine, and fecal samples. Eight sets of primers were designed to recognize six or eight distinct sequences on target bla(NDM-1), and one set was selected as the most appropriate set of primers for its rapid detection. The specificity and sensitivity of the primers in the LAMP reactions for bla(NDM-1) detection were determined. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay for bla(NDM-1) detection in sputum, urine, and fecal samples was also tested. Two methods, namely, monitoring of turbidity and addition of calcein to the reaction tube, were used to determine negative and positive results. The results showed that target DNA was amplified and visualized by the two detection methods within 70 min at an isothermal temperature of 65°C. The sensitivity of LAMP, with a detection limit of 10.70 pg/μl DNA, was 100-fold greater than that of PCR. Thirteen infection bacterial strains without bla(NDM-1) were selected for testing of specificity, and the results of the amplification were negative, which showed that the primers had good levels of specificity. The LAMP method reported here is demonstrated to be a potentially valuable means for the detection of bla(NDM-1) and rapid clinical diagnosis, being fast, simple, and low in cost.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
