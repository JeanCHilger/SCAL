Since contact intervals can be right censored, survival analysis is the natural approach to estimation. Estimates of the contact interval distribution can be used to estimate R(0) in both mass-action and network-based models. We apply these methods to 2 data sets from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
