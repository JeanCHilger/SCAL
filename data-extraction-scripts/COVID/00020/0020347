<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-02-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Insights into cellular factors that regulate HIV-1 replication in human cells</TITLE><BODY>Retroviruses integrate into the host cellâ€™s chromosome. Accordingly, many aspects of the life cycle of retroviruses like HIV-1 are intimately linked to the functions of cellular proteins and RNAs. In this review, we discuss in brief recent genome-wide screens for the identification of cellular proteins that assist HIV-1 replication in human cells. We also review findings on other cellular moieties that help or restrict the viral life cycle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
