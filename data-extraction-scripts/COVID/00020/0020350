Here we explore the use of interferon-β to adjuvant the response to a rabies virus (RV) vaccine vector expressing both HIV-1 Gag and IFN-β. Viral load and immune responses of immunized mice were analyzed over time. Our results indicate that the RV expressing IFN-β (IFN(+)) is highly attenuated when compared to control RV and demonstrate that the expression of IFN-β reduces viral replication approximately 100-fold. Despite the decrease in replication, those mice immunized with the IFN(+) RV had a significantly greater number of activated CD8+ T cells. The increased activation of CD8+ T cells was dependent on IFN-β signaling, as we saw no difference following infection of IFNAR−/− mice. Although mice immunized with IFN(+) have a greater primary immune response than controls, immunized mice that were challenged with vaccinia expressing Gag had no significant difference in the number or functionality of CD8+ T cells. The increased CD8+ T cell activation in the presence of IFN-β, even with greatly reduced viral replication, indicates the beneficial effect of IFN-β for the host.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
