DUB activity is usually assayed using full-length ubiquitin, and these enzymes generally show low activity on small substrates that constitute the P4-P1 LRGG C-terminal motif of ubiquitin. To gain insight into the C-terminal recognition region of ubiquitin by DUBs we synthesized positional scanning libraries of fluorogenic tetrapeptides and tested them on three examples of human DUBs (OTU-1, Iso-T and UCH-L3) and one viral ubiquitin specific protease – Plpro from West Nile virus. In most cases the results show flexibility in the P4 position, very high specificity for Arg in P3 position and Gly at P2 – in accord with the sequence of the natural substrate ubiquitin. Surprisingly, screening of the P2 position revealed that UCH-L3 in contrast to all the other tested DUBs, demonstrates substantial tolerance of Ala and Val at P2, and a parallel analysis using the appropriate mutation of the full-length ubiquitin confirms this. We have also used an optimal tetrapeptide substrate, Ac-LRGG-AFC to investigate the activation mechanism of DUBs by ubiquitin and elevated salts concentration. Together, our results reveal the importance of the dual features of 1) substrate specificity and 2) the mechanism of ubiquitin binding in determining deubiquitination by this group of proteases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
