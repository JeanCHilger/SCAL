<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-11-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete Genome Sequence of a Recombinant Nephropathogenic Infectious Bronchitis Virus Strain in China</TITLE><BODY>Recently, nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) outbreaks have occurred in commercial broiler flocks and have been associated with a high incidence and morbidity in China. The CK/CH/Zhejiang/06/10 strain (IBV-YX10) was isolated from a 12-day-old broiler chicken in a flock of chickens with swollen speckled kidneys and distended ureters filled with uric acid in China in 2010. Here we reported the complete genomic sequence of the IBV-YX10 which was a natural recombinant nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus strain. These findings will contribute additional insights into the molecular characteristics of evolving IBV genomes and the need for effective control of IBV in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
