To understand the mechanism of this effect, we have analyzed the transcriptional profiles of primary human fibroblast cells that were first treated with IFN-β1, IFN-γ, or a combination of both and then subsequently infected with HSV-1. We have identified two types of synergistic activities in the gene expression patterns induced by IFN-β1 and IFN-γ that may contribute to inhibition of HSV-1 replication. The first is defined as “synergy by independent action,” in which IFN-β1 and IFN-γ induce distinct gene categories. The second, “synergy by cooperative action,” is a term that describes the positive interaction between IFN-β1 and IFN-γ as defined by a two-way analysis of variance. This form of synergy leads to a much higher level of expression for a subset of genes than is seen with either interferon alone. The cooperatively induced genes by IFN-β1 and IFN-γ include those involved in apoptosis, RNA degradation, and the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the combination of IFN-β1 and IFN-γ induces significantly more apoptosis and inhibits HSV-1 gene expression and DNA replication significantly more than treatment with either interferon alone. Taken together, these data suggest that IFN-β1 and IFN-γ work both independently and cooperatively to create an antiviral state that synergistically inhibits HSV-1 replication in primary human fibroblasts and that cooperatively induced apoptosis may play a role in the synergistic effect on viral replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
