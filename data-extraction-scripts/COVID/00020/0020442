To identify PVAN-specific gene expression and underlying molecular mechanisms we analyzed kidney biopsies with and without PVAN. METHODS: The study included 168 posttransplant renal allograft biopsies (T cell mediated rejection=26, PVAN=10, normal functioning graft (STA) =73, and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) =59) from 168 unique kidney allograft recipients. We performed gene expression assays and bioinformatics analysis to identify a set of PVAN-specific genes. Validity and relevance of a subset of these genes are validated by QPCR and IHC. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of all the biopsies revealed high similarity between PVAN and TCMR gene expression. Increased statistical stringency identified 158 and 252 unique PVAN and TCMR injury-specific gene transcripts respectively. While TCMR-specific genes were overwhelmingly involved in immune response costimulation and TCR signaling, PVAN-specific genes were mainly related to DNA replication process, RNA polymerase assembly and pathogen recognition receptors. A principal component analysis using these genes further confirmed the most optimal separation between the 3 different clinical phenotypes. Validation of 4 PVAN-specific genes (RPS15, CFD, LTF, and NOSIP) by QPCR and confirmation by immunohistochemistry of 2 PVAN-specific proteins with anti-viral function (LTF and IFITM1) was done. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, even though PVAN and TCMR kidney allografts share great similarities on gene perturbation, PVAN-specific genes were identified with well-known anti-viral properties that provide tools for discerning PVAN and AR as well as attractive targets for rational drug design.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
