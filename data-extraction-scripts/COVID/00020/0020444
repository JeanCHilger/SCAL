Viruses are known to evade the establishment of an antiviral state by regulating the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a critical transcription factor in the alpha/beta interferon induction pathway. Here, we show that dengue virus (DENV) circumvents the induction of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor (RLR) pathway during infection by blocking serine 386 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. This effect is associated with the expression of nonstructural 2B/3 protein (NS2B/3) protease in human cells. Using interaction assays, we found that NS2B/3 interacts with the cellular IκB kinase ε (IKKε). Docking computational analysis revealed that in this interaction, NS2B/3 masks the kinase domain of IKKε and potentially affects its functionality. This observation is supported by the DENV-associated inhibition of the kinase activity of IKKε. Our data identify IKKε as a novel target of DENV NS2B/3 protease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
