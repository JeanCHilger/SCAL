<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Presepsin as a novel sepsis biomarker</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: In 2004, a new biomarker sCD14-subtypes (presepsin) was found and its value was shown in the diagnosis and evaluation of sepsis. This article is a brief overview of the new biomarker. DATA SOURCES: A literature search using multiple databases was performed for articles, especially meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Compared with other markers, presepsin seems to have a better sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of sepsis. Presepsin as a biom1arker is not only suitable for the early diagnosis of sepsis, but also for the assessment of its severity and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin has a higher sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of sepsis as a new biomarker, and is a predictor for the prognosis of sepsis. More importantly, preseptin seems to play a crucial role as a supplemental method in the early diagnosis of sepsis. Since there is no multicenter study on the relationship between presepsin and sepsis, further studies on the clinical values of presepsin are needed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
