HPV58 is the third most common HPV genotype in China after HPV16 and HPV18. HPV E6 and E7 are oncoproteins and are constitutively expressed in HPV-associated cancer cells, therefore they are considered to be ideal target antigens for immunotherapy, including HPV therapeutic vaccine. In the present study, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope peptides were predicted and screened from HPV58 E7 antigen and their immunogenicity was subsequently determined. A total of 6 HLA-A2-binding peptides derived from HPV58 E7 were predicted and selected using 3 different prediction programs. A negative control peptide and PBS were used as two negative controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with HLA-A2(+) allele were used to detect the specific cellular immune response among the 6 predicted peptides by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISOPT). Following preliminary screening for the predicted peptides, the antigenicity of the peptide HPV58 E7(72-80) was further assessed by an immunoassay to a vaccine contained HPV58 E7 antigen. Specific humoral and cellular immunity were detected using the peptide HPV58 E7(72-80) as the specific antigen. A total of 6 peptides from HPV58 E7 protein were predicted and subsequently named P1 (E7(7-15): TLREYILDL), P2 (E7(14-22): DLHPEPTDL), P3 (E7(69-77): CINSTTTDV), and P4 (E7(72-80): STTTDVRTL), P5 (E7(79-87): TLQQLLMGT) and P6 (E7(83-91): LLMGTCTIV). In the ELISPOT assay on HLA-A2 (+) human PBMCs, interferon (IFN)-γ-production was evident in the P2 and P4 groups. The average numbers of IFN-γ associated spots in the P2 and P4 groups was 50.61±5.37 spot-forming cells (SFC)/1×10(5) and 266±34.42 SFC/1×10(5), respectively. The numbers of spots in the two peptides were significantly increased compared with the other 4 peptides and the control groups (P<0.05). In the further antigenicity verification of P4 (HPV58 E7(72-80)), the peptide only stimulated the humoral immune response of the AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine containing HPV58 E7 antigen. Compared with the 2 negative control groups (1:400), the antibody titers of the vaccine group (1:25,600) were significantly increased (P<0.05). In cellular immunoassays the average number of IFN-γ associated spots was 143.3±32.13 SFC/1×10(5) in the vaccine group, which was significantly enhanced compared with the PBS group (8±5.29 SFC/1×10(5); P<0.01) and the AD-NC group (28±5.13 SFC/1×10(5); P<0.01). The peptide HPV58 E7(72-80) (STTTDVRTL) displayed sufficient antigenicity to a vaccine contained HPV58 E7 antigen. Therefore, HPV58 E7(72-80) peptide may be considered as a candidate epitope peptide for the construction of HPV58 peptide vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
