The outcomes of cytokine/chemokine signaling in neural cells vary widely, with cell-specific effects on cellular activity, proliferation, and survival. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) are often altered during viral infections, through direct infection by the virus or by the influence of immune cell activity or cytokine/chemokine signaling. However, it has been challenging to dissect the contribution of the virus and specific inflammatory mediators during an infection. In addition to initiating an antiviral program in infected NSPCs, cytokines/chemokines can induce multiple changes in NSPC behavior that can perturb NSPC numbers, differentiation into other neural cells, and migration to sites of injury, and ultimately brain development and repair. The focus of this review was to dissect the effects of common antiviral cytokines and chemokines on NSPC activity, and to consider the subsequent pathological consequences for the host from changes in NSPC function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
