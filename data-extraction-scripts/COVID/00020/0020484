Dengue virus (DENV) and other clinically important flaviviruses are suppressed by type I IFN. While mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (Ifnar1(−/−)) succumb to DENV infection, we found that mice deficient in three TFs controlling type I IFN production, Irf3(−/−)xIrf5(−/−)xIrf7(−/−) triple knockout (TKO), survive DENV challenge. DENV infection of TKO mice resulted in minimal type I IFN production but a robust type II IFN (IFNγ) response. Using loss-of-function approaches for various molecules, we demonstrate that the IRF-3, -5, -7-independent pathway utilizes predominantly IFNγ, and to a lesser degree type I IFNs. This pathway signals via IRF-1 to stimulate IL-12 production and IFNγ response. These results reveal a key antiviral role for IRF-1 by activating both type I and II IFN responses during DENV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
