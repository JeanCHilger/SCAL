<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-08-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Endocytosis of Viruses and Bacteria</TITLE><BODY>Of the many pathogens that infect humans and animals, a large number use cells of the host organism as protected sites for replication. To reach the relevant intracellular compartments, they take advantage of the endocytosis machinery and exploit the network of endocytic organelles for penetration into the cytosol or as sites of replication. In this review, we discuss the endocytic entry processes used by viruses and bacteria and compare the strategies used by these dissimilar classes of pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
