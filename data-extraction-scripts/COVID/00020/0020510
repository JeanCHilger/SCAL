This study aimed to explore associations between PPARγ gene single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and susceptibility to and clinical outcome of sepsis in the North China Han population. METHODS: This study included 303 patients with sepsis and 303 controls. We conducted genetic typing for 13 common PPARγ gene SNPs (improved multiplex ligation detection reaction), linkage disequilibrium mapping, and haplotype inference. Associations between SNP genotypes/haplotypes and sepsis susceptibility and outcome (septic shock, organ dysfunction, or death) were assessed using unconditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: For rs2972164, patients with genotypes CT/CT+TT had higher risk of sepsis than genotype CC (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.74 [1.05‐2.86], P = .03 and 1.72 [1.06‐2.80], P = .026, respectively); the T allele was associated with increased sepsis risk compared with the C allele (1.64 [1.04‐2.58], P = .033). For rs1801282, genotypes CG/CG+GG had lower risk of sepsis than genotype CC (0.55 [0.33‐0.92], P = .024 and 0.57 [0.35‐0.95], P = .03, respectively); the G allele was associated with decreased sepsis risk compared with the C allele (0.62 [0.39‐1.01], P = .055). For rs4135275, genotypes AG/AG+GG had higher risk of severe organ dysfunction (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome score >8) than genotype AA (2.66 [1.16‐6.09], P = .038 and 2.21 [1.00‐4.85], P = .042, respectively). Haplotype TAT (rs2972164, rs4684846, and rs17036188) was associated with increased sepsis risk (1.66 [1.03‐2.67], P = .038). CONCLUSIONS: No mutation was correlated with septic shock or death. PPARγ gene polymorphisms may play a role in the occurrence and progression of sepsis in the North China Han population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
