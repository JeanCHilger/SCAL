At 13 months of age, the cat was evaluated for acute collapse. The cat was icteric with severe hyperbilirubinemia but no hematocrit changes. Severe obtundation and lateral recumbency progressed to tetraparesis and loss of proprioception in all four limbs, and a cerebellar or brainstem lesion was suspected. Post-mortem examination revealed suppurative cholangiohepatitis and acute neuronal necrosis in the nuclei of the brainstem and cerebellum, consistent with bilirubin encephalopathy. This is the first known occurrence of cholangiohepatitis and bilirubin encephalopathy in an adult cat with chronic hemolytic anemia. Although rare, bilirubin encephalopathy should be considered as a possible sequela to hyperbilirubinemia in adult patients. It remains unknown whether increased OF was related to the cholangiohepatopathy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
