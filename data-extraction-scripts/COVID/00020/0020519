The potential for serotype-cross-reactive antibodies to exacerbate disease during a secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype has driven efforts to study human DENV-specific antibodies. Most DENV-specific antibodies generated in humans are serotype-cross-reactive, weakly neutralizing, and directed against the immature pre-membrane (prM), envelope (E), and nonstructural 1 (NS1) proteins. To broaden the characterization of human DENV-specific antibodies, we assessed B-cell responses by ELISpot assays and isolated B cells from the peripheral blood of a human subject with previous DENV infection. Forty-eight human IgG monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) were initially characterized by their potential to bind to an inactivated lysate of DENV-infected cells. Subsequently, most DENV-specific hMAbs were found to bind soluble, recombinant E protein (rE). Two hMAbs were unable to bind rE, despite strongly binding to the DENV-infected cell lysate. Further analyses showed that these two hMAbs bound conformation-dependent, reduction-sensitive epitopes on E protein. These data shed light on the breadth of DENV-specific hMAbs generated within a single immune donor.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
