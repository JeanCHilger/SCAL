Lethal infection induced increased levels of MMP-3 and MMP-12 mRNAs as well as that of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) compared to sublethal infection. Increased induction of MMP, TIMP, and chemokine expression correlated with increased virus replication but not with inflammatory cell infiltration. Infection of immunosuppressed mice suggested that expression of most MMP, TIMP, and chemokine mRNA was induced primarily in CNS-resident cells. By contrast, MMP-9 protein activity was associated with the infiltration of neutrophils into the CNS. These data indicate an association between the magnitude of inflammatory gene expression within the CNS and viral virulence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
