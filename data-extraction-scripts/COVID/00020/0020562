In this paper, we report for the first time the sporadically current seroprevalence of (H1N1) pdm09 influenza A virus infection in cats in China. Thirteen of 1,080 sera were found positive by nucleoprotein (NP)-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in different cat populations in southern China. It is very important to stress further surveillance of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A virus in cats in southern China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
