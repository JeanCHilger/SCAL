TCR-transduced T cells specific for infectious pathogens have been described, but their protective function in vivo has not yet been examined. Here, we demonstrate that CD8 T cells transduced with the P14 TCR specific for the gp33 epitope of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus exhibit protective activities in both viral and bacterial infection models in mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
