<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-09-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Clinical Utility of On-Demand Multiplex Respiratory Pathogen Testing among Adult Outpatients</TITLE><BODY>Multiplex tests for respiratory tract infections include up to 20 targets for common pathogens, predominantly viruses. A specific therapeutic intervention is available for individuals testing positive for influenza viruses (oseltamivir), and it is potentially beneficial to identify non-influenza viruses to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. We evaluated antimicrobial prescriptions following respiratory pathogen testing among outpatients at a large Veterans Administration (VA) medical center. Results of the FilmArray respiratory panel (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) from 15 December 2014 to 15 April 2015 were evaluated among 408 outpatients, and patient medical records were reviewed. Differences in antibiotic and oseltamivir prescription rates were analyzed. Among 408 patients tested in outpatient centers (emergency departments, urgent care clinics, and outpatient clinics), 295 (72.3%) were managed as outpatients. Among these 295 outpatients, 105 (35.6%) tested positive for influenza virus, 109 (36.9%) tested positive for a non-influenza virus pathogen, and 81 (27.5%) had no respiratory pathogen detected. Rates of oseltamivir and antibiotic prescriptions were significantly different among the three test groups (chi-squared values of 167.6 [P < 0.0001] and 10.48 [P = 0.005], respectively), but there was no significant difference in antibiotic prescription rates between the non-influenza virus pathogen group and those who tested negative (chi-square value, 0; P = 1.0). Among adult outpatients, testing positive for influenza virus was associated with receiving fewer antibiotic prescriptions, but no such effect was seen for those who tested positive for a non-influenza virus. These data suggest that testing for influenza viruses alone may be sufficient and more cost-effective than multiplex pathogen testing for outpatients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
