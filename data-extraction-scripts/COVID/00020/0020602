These activate dendritic cells (DC) to become highly effective antigen-presenting cells (APC). We assessed whether TLR ligand-treated DC can enhance the otherwise defective response of aged naïve CD4 T cells. In vivo administration of CpG, PolyI:C and Pam(3)CSK(4) in combination with antigen resulted in the increased expression of costimulatory molecules and MHC class II by dendritic cells (DC), elevated serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and RANTES, and increased cognate CD4 T cell responses in young and aged mice. We show that in vitro, pre-activation of DC by TLR ligands makes them more efficient APC for aged naïve CD4 T cells. Following T:DC interaction, there are enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, and greater expansion of the aged T cells, resulting from increased proliferation and greater effector survival with increased levels of Bcl-2. TLR pre-activation of both bone marrow derived and ex vivo DC improved responses. IL-6 produced by the activated DC during cognate T cell interaction was necessary for enhanced aged CD4 T cell expansion and survival. These studies suggest that some age-associated immune defects may be overcome by targeted activation of APC by TLR ligands.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
