Despite of their potential significance as promising vaccine candidates, the protein composition of VLPs produced in insect cells has not been well characterized. Here we report a proteomic analysis of influenza VLPs containing hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix M1 proteins from a human isolate of avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5 VLPs) produced in insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system. Comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified H5 VLPs identified viral proteins and 37 additional host-derived proteins, many of which are known to be present in other enveloped viruses. Proteins involved in different cellular structures and functions were found to be present in H5 VLPs including those from the cytoskeleton, translation, chaperone, and metabolism. Immunization with purified H5 VLPs induced protective immunity, which was comparable to the inactivated whole virus containing all viral components. Unpurified H5 VLPs containing excess amounts of non-influenza soluble proteins also conferred 100% protection against lethal challenge although lower immune responses were induced. These results provide important implications consistent with the idea that VLP production in insect cells may involve similar cellular machinery as other RNA enveloped viruses during synthesis, assembly, trafficking, and budding processes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
