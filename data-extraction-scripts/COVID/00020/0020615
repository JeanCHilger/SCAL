Tamarins (Saguinus species) infected by GB virus B (GBV-B) are considered a valid surrogate model for hepatitis C to study the biology of HCV infection and the development of new antiviral drugs. To test the efficacy of local delivery and expression of IFN-α in this model, we have developed HD-TET-tIFN, a helper-dependent adenovirus vector expressing tamarin IFN-α (tIFN) under the control of the tetracycline-inducible transactivator rtTA2(s)-S2. Expression of tIFN was successfully induced both in vitro and in vivo in rodents by doxycycline administration with consequent activation of IFN-responsive genes. More importantly, tIFN efficiently inhibited GBV-B replicon in a Huh-7 hepatoma cell line at low HD-TET-tIFN doses. A certain degree of transcriptional control of tIFN was achieved in tamarins injected with HD-TET-tIFN, but under the conditions used in this study, infection and replication of GBV-B were only delayed and not totally abrogated upon virus challenge. Hepatic delivery and regulated expression of IFN-α appear to be a possible approach for the cure of hepatitis, but this approach requires more studies to increase its efficacy. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a regulated gene expression in a nonhuman primate hepatitis model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
