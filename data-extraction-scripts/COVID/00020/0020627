We here discuss several families of dsRNA-binding proteins involved in mammalian antiviral innate immunity. These include RIG-I-like receptors, protein kinase R, oligoadenylate synthases, adenosine deaminases acting on RNA, RNA interference systems, and other proteins containing dsRNA-binding domains and helicase domains. Studies suggest that their functions are highly interdependent and that their interdependence could offer keys to understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms for cellular dsRNA homeostasis and antiviral immunity. This review aims to highlight their interconnectivity, as well as their commonalities and differences in their dsRNA recognition mechanisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
