Leading this push are direct acting antivirals (DAAs), currently comprised of inhibitors that target the HCV protease NS3, viral polymerase NS5B and the nonstructural protein NS5A. In combination with one another, along with the traditional standard of care ribavirin and PEGylated-IFNα, these compounds have proven to afford tremendous efficacy to treatment-naïve patients, as well as to prior non-responders. Nevertheless, by targeting viral components the possibility of selecting for breakthrough and treatment-resistant virus strains remains a concern. Host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) are a distinct class of anti-HCV compounds that is emerging as a complementary set of tools to combat the disease. Cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitors are one such group in this category. In contrast to DAAs, Cyp inhibitors target a host protein, CypA, and have also demonstrated remarkable antiviral efficiency in clinical trials, without the generation of viral escape mutants. This review serves to summarize the current literature on cyclophilins and their relationship to the HCV viral life cycle, as well as other viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
