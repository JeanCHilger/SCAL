In support to the antibody-based therapeutics, the advent of recent technologies has made human antibody screening and production progressively more economic. Among those technologies, phage-display antibody library has been successfully applied in the antibody-based drug development both as fully human antibody sources and tools for antibody engineering. Building up a high-quality antibody library with a large library size and high diversity has been crucial for successful isolation of antibodies. Here we describe an efficient strategy for the construction of a large naïve phage-display human Fab library with one-step cloning. Optimization of each key step is extensively discussed and simplified protocols for library panning and Fab production are also described.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
