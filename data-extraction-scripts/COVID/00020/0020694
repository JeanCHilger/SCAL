<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The Changing Microbial Epidemiology in Cystic Fibrosis</TITLE><BODY>Summary: Infection of the airways remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with cystic fibrosis (CF). This review describes salient features of the epidemiologies of microbial species that are involved in respiratory tract infection in CF. The apparently expanding spectrum of species causing infection in CF and recent changes in the incidences and prevalences of infection due to specific bacterial, fungal, and viral species are described. The challenges inherent in tracking and interpreting rates of infection in this patient population are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
