Classical DC (cDC) include two major subsets distinguished in the mouse by the expression of CD8α. Here we describe a subset of CD8α(+) DC in lymphoid organs of naïve mice characterized by expression of the CX(3)CR1 chemokine receptor. CX(3)CR1(+) CD8α(+) DC lack hallmarks of classical CD8α(+) DC, including IL-12 secretion, the capacity to cross-present antigen, and their developmental dependence on the transcriptional factor BatF3. Gene-expression profiling showed that CX(3)CR1(+) CD8α(+) DC resemble CD8α(−) cDC. The microarray analysis further revealed a unique plasmacytoid DC (PDC) gene signature of CX(3)CR1(+) CD8α(+) DC. A PDC relationship of the cells is supported further by the fact that they harbor characteristic D–J Ig gene rearrangements and that development of CX(3)CR1(+) CD8α(+) DC requires E2-2, the critical transcriptional regulator of PDC. Thus, CX(3)CR1(+) CD8α(+) DC represent a unique DC subset, related to but distinct from PDC. Collectively, the expression-profiling data of this study refine the resolution of previous DC definitions, sharpen the border of classical CD8α(+) and CD8α(−) DC, and should assist the identification of human counterparts of murine DC subsets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
