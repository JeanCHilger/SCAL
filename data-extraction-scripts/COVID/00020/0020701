A potential strategy is to target host proteins required for viruses but non-essential for the host. To identify such proteins, we performed a genome-wide knockout screen in human haploid cells and identified the calcium pump SPCA1. SPCA1 is required by viruses from the Paramyxo-, Flavi-, and Togaviridae families, including measles, dengue, West Nile, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Calcium transport activity is required for SPCA1 to promote virus spread. SPCA1 regulates proteases within the trans-Golgi network that require calcium for their activity and are critical for virus glycoprotein maturation. Consistent with these findings, viral glycoproteins fail to mature in SPCA1-deficient cells preventing viral spread, which is evident even in cells with partial loss of SPCA1. Thus, SPCA1 is an attractive antiviral host target for a broad spectrum of established and emerging viral infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
