<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-01-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Development and Validation of a Rapid Immunochromatographic Assay for Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Antigen in Dromedary Camels</TITLE><BODY>We present here a rapid immunochromatographic assay for the detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) antigen in the nasal swabs of dromedary camels. The assay is based on the detection of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein in a short time frame using highly selective monoclonal antibodies at room temperature. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the assay were found to be 93.90% and 100%, respectively, compared to that of the UpE and open reading frame 1A (Orf1A) real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The results suggest that the assay developed here is a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
