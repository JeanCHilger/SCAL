<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-05-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete Genome Sequence of a Novel Porcine Enterovirus Strain in China</TITLE><BODY>The porcine enteroviruses (PEVs) belong to the family Picornaviridae. We report a complete genome sequence of a novel PEV strain that is widely prevalent in pigs at least in central and eastern China. The complete genome consists of 7,390 nucleotides, excluding the 3â€² poly(A) tail, and has an open reading frame that maps between nucleotide positions 812 and 7318 and encodes a 2,168-amino-acid polyprotein. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 3CD and VP1 regions reveals that this PEV strain belongs to a species of PEV9 but may represent a novel sero-/genotype in CPE group III. We also report the major findings from bootscan analysis based on the whole genomes of PEVs in the present study and those available in GenBank.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
