<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Tuberculosis in the elderly: Why inflammation matters</TITLE><BODY>Growing old is associated with an increase in the basal inflammatory state of an individual and susceptibility to many diseases, including infectious diseases. Evidence is growing to support the concept that inflammation and disease susceptibility in the elderly is linked. Our studies focus on the infectious disease tuberculosis (TB), which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), a pathogen that infects approximately one fourth of the worldâ€™s population. Aging is a major risk factor for developing TB, and inflammation has been strongly implicated. In this review we will discuss the relationship between inflammation in the lung and susceptibility to develop and succumb to TB in old age. Further understanding of the relationship between inflammation, age, and M.tb will lead to informed decisions about TB prevention and treatment strategies that are uniquely designed for the elderly.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
