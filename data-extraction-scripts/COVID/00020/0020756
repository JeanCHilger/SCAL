To simplify the interpretation of antibody action, we carried out a study of postattachment neutralization (PAN), where virus is allowed to attach to target cells before neutralizing antibody is introduced. We used influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules and their Fabs specific to antigenic sites Sb (tip), Ca2 (loop), and Cb (hinge) of the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) protein. All IgGs and Fabs gave PAN, although with reduced efficiency compared with STAN. Thus, bivalent binding of antibody was not essential for PAN. By definition, none of these MAbs gave PAN by inhibiting virus attachment, and they did not elute attached virus from the target cell or inhibit endocytosis of virus. However, virus-cell fusion, as demonstrated by R18 fluorescence dequenching or hemolysis of red blood cells, was inhibited in direct proportion to neutralization and in a dose-dependent manner and was thus likely to be responsible for the observed neutralization. However, to get PAN, it was necessary to inhibit the activation of the prefusion intermediate, the earliest known form on the fusion pathway that is created when virus is incubated at pH 5 and 4Â°C. PAN antibodies may act by binding HA trimers in contact with the cell and/or trimers in the immediate vicinity of the virus-cell contact point and so inhibit the recruitment of additional receptor-HA complexes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
