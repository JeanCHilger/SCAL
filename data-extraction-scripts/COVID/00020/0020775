Whether allogeneic NPCs are tolerated or induce immune-mediated rejection is controversial and poorly defined under neuroinflammatory demyelinating conditions. We have used the JHMV-induced demyelination model to evaluate the antigenicity of transplanted allogeneic NPCs within the central nervous system (CNS) of mice with established immune-mediated demyelination. Cultured NPCs constitutively expressed the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 and IFN-γ treatment induced expression of MHC class I and II antigens. Injection of allogeneic C57BL/6 NPCs (H-2(b) background) led to a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in Balb/c (H-2(d) background) associated with T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion following co-culture with allogeneic NPCs. Transplantation of MHC-mismatched NPCs into JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased transcripts encoding the T cell chemoattractant chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 that correlated with increased T cell infiltration that was associated with NPC rejection. Treatment of MHC-mismatched mice with T cell subset-specific depleting antibodies increased survival of allogeneic NPCs without affecting commitment to an oligodendroyte lineage. Collectively, these results show that allogeneic NPCs are antigenic and T cells contribute to rejection following transplantation into an inflamed CNS suggesting that immunomodulatory treatments may be necessary to prolong survival of allogeneic cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
