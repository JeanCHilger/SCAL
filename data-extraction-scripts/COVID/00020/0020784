It detected SARS-CoV in 11 of 17 (65%) samples from SARS patients as early as day 2 of illness but in none of the 10 samples from healthy controls. Compared with other diagnostic modalities for detecting SARS-CoV, this assay is simpler, more convenient, and economical. It could be an alternative for early and rapid diagnosis, should SARS return in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
