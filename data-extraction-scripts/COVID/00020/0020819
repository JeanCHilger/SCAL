This vector, given intramuscularly in a single dose, induced high-level antibody titers to LcrV and gave 90–100% protection against pneumonic plague challenge in mice. This single-dose protection was significantly better than that generated by VSV expressing the non–secreted LcrV protein. Increased protection correlated with increased anti-LcrV antibody and a bias toward IgG2a and away from IgG1 isotypes. We also found that depletion of CD4(+) cells, but not CD8(+) cells, at the time of challenge resulted in reduced vaccine protection, indicating a role for cellular immunity in protection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
