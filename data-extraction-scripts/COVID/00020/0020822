Virus and host intrinsic characteristics strongly modulate the outcome of viral infections. Recently we determined the circumstances under which enhanced replication of virus within the lymphoid tissue is beneficial for the outcome of a disease. This enforced viral replication promotes anti‐viral immune activation and, counterintuitively, accelerates virus control. In this review we summarize the mechanisms that contribute to enforced viral replication. Antigen‐presenting cells and CD169(+) macrophages exhibit enforced viral replication after infection with the model viruses lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Ubiquitin‐specific peptidase 18 (Usp18), an endogenous type I interferon blocker in CD169(+) macrophages, has been identified as a proviral gene, as are B cell activating factor (BAFF) and carcinoembryonic antigen‐related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Lymphotoxins (LT) strongly enhance viral replication in the spleen and lymph nodes. All these factors modulate splenic architecture and thereby promote the development of CD169(+) macrophages. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α) and nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cell signaling (NF‐κB) have been found to promote the survival of infected CD169(+) macrophages, thereby similarly promoting enforced viral replication. Association of autoimmune disease with infections is evident from (1) autoimmune phenomena described during a chronic virus infection; (2) onset of autoimmune disease simultaneous to viral infections; and (3) experimental evidence. Involvement of virus infection during onset of type I diabetes is strongly evident. Epstein–Bar virus (EBV) infection was discussed to be involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. In conclusion, several mechanisms promote viral replication in secondary lymphatic organs. Identifying such factors in humans is a challenge for future studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
