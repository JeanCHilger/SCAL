During the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle, GBF1 performs a critical function at the onset of genome replication but is dispensable when the replication is established. To better understand how GBF1 regulates HCV infection, we have looked for interactions between GBF1 and HCV proteins. NS3 was found to interact with GBF1 in yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays and to interfere with GBF1 function and alter GBF1 intracellular localization in cells expressing NS3. The interaction was mapped to the Sec7 domain of GBF1 and the protease domain of NS3. A reverse yeast two-hybrid screen to identify mutations altering NS3-GBF1 interaction yielded an NS3 mutant (N77D, Con1 strain) that is nonreplicative despite conserved protease activity and does not interact with GBF1. The mutated residue is exposed at the surface of NS3, suggesting it is part of the domain of NS3 that interacts with GBF1. The corresponding mutation in strain JFH-1 (S77D) produces a similar phenotype. Our results provide evidence for an interaction between NS3 and GBF1 and suggest that an alteration of this interaction is detrimental to HCV genome replication. IMPORTANCE Single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses rely to a significant extent on host factors to achieve the replication of their genome. GBF1 is such a cellular protein that is required for the replication of several RNA viruses, but its mechanism of action during viral infections is not yet defined. In this study, we investigated potential interactions that GBF1 might engage in with proteins of HCV, a GBF1-dependent virus. We found that GBF1 interacts with NS3, a nonstructural protein involved in HCV genome replication, and our results suggest that this interaction is important for GBF1 function during HCV replication. Interestingly, GBF1 interaction with HCV appears different from its interaction with enteroviruses, another group of GBF1-dependent RNA viruses, in keeping with the fact that HCV and enteroviruses use different functions of GBF1.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
