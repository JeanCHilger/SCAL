Protein microarrays have been shown to be a powerful method in biomarker discovery and the identification of novel proteinâ€“protein interaction networks, suggesting that this technique could also be very useful in studies of infectious RNA viruses. However, to date, the amount of genetic material required to produce protein arrays, as well as the time- and labor-intensive procedures typically needed, have limited their more widespread application. Here, we introduce a method, protein microarray fabrication through gene synthesis (PAGES), for the rapid and efficient construction of protein microarrays particularly for RNA viruses. Using dengue virus as an example, we first identify consensus sequences from 3,604 different strains and then fabricate complete proteomic microarrays that are unique for each consensus sequence. To demonstrate their applicability, we show that these microarrays can differentiate sera from patients infected by dengue virus, related pathogens, or from uninfected patients. We anticipate that the microarray and expression library constructed in this study will find immediate use in further studies of dengue virus and that, more generally, PAGES will become a widely applied method in the clinical characterization of RNA viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
