Because interleukin-18 (IL-18) mediates T helper 1 driven immune responses, and since mature IL-18 is up-regulated in human macrophages after influenza virus infection in vitro, it has been suggested that IL-18 plays an important role in the immune response to influenza. To determine the role of IL-18 in respiratory tract infection with influenza, IL-18 gene-deficient (IL-18(–/–)) and normal wildtype mice were intranasally inoculated with influenza A virus. Influenza resulted in an increase in constitutively expressed IL-18 in the lungs of wildtype mice. The clearance of influenza A was inhibited by IL-18, as indicated by reduced viral loads on day 8 and day 12 after infection in IL-18(–/–) mice. This enhanced viral clearance correlated with increased CD4(+) T-cell activation in the lungs as reflected by CD69 expression on the cell surface. Surprisingly, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were similar in the lungs of IL-18(–/–) mice and wildtype mice. Intracellular IFN-γ staining revealed similar expression levels in lung-derived natural killer cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, indicating that IFN-γ production is IL-18-independent during influenza virus infection. Tumour necrosis factor-α production by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in IL-18(–/–) mice than in wildtype mice. Our data indicate that endogenous IL-18 impairs viral clearance during influenza A infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
