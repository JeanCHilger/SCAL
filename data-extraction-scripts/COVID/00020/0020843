However, the antiviral activity of honokiol has not yet been well studied. Here we showed that honokiol had no effect on herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) entry, but inhibited HSV-1 viral DNA replication, gene expression and the production of new progeny viruses. The combination of honokiol and clinical drug acyclovir augmented inhibition of HSV-1 infection. Our results illustrate that honokiol could be a potential new candidate for clinical consideration in the treatment of HSV-1 infection alone or combination with other therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
