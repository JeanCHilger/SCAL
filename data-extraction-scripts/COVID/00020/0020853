However, the exact mechanisms underlying HRV infection in allergic airways are poorly understood. IL-13 increases interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase M (IRAK-M) and subsequently inhibits airway innate immunity against bacteria. However, the role of IRAK-M in lung HRV infection remains unclear. Here, we provide the first evidence that IRAK-M over-expression promotes lung epithelial HRV-16 replication and autophagy, but inhibits HRV-16-induced IFN-β and IFN-λ1 expression. Inhibiting autophagy reduces HRV-16 replication. Exogenous IFN-β and IFN-λ1 inhibit autophagy and HRV-16 replication. Our data indicate the enhancing effect of IRAK-M on epithelial HRV-16 infection, which is partly through the autophagic pathway. Impaired anti-viral interferon production may serve as a direct or an indirect (e.g., autophagy) mechanism of enhanced HRV-16 infection by IRAK-M over-expression. Targeting autophagic pathway or administrating anti-viral interferons may prevent or attenuate viral (e.g., HRV-16) infections in allergic airways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
