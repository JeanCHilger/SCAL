So far, the role of IL-17 in viral infections and type 1 diabetes is ambiguous. In this study, we used IL-17A eGFP bicistronic reporter mouse strains to analyze in situ production of IL-17A. Upon Klebsiella pneumonia bacterial infection, CD4(+) and γδ T cells produce IL-17A. In contrast, CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells do not produce IL-17A in response to acute or protracted viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), or during autoimmune diabetes development in the CD8-driven LCMV-induced model of type 1 diabetes. We conclude that viral elimination and type 1 diabetes can occur in the absence of detectable IL-17A production, suggesting IL-17A is not essential in these settings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
