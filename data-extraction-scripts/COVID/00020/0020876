Antisense oligonucleotide binding to mature microRNA and splicing junctions on pre-mRNA represent methods of gene therapy that respectively inhibit microRNA-mediated gene regulation and induce alternative splicing. We have developed biodegradable polymer nanoparticles--which are coated with cell-penetrating peptides--that can effectively deliver chemically-modified oligonucleotide analogs to achieve these forms of gene regulation. We found that this nanoparticle system could block the activity of the oncogenic microRNA, miR-155, as well as modulate splicing to attenuate the expression of the proto-oncogene, MCL-1. Regulation of these genes in human cancer cells reduced cell viability and produced pro-apoptotic effects. These findings establish polymer nanoparticles as delivery vectors for non-conventional forms of gene therapy activated by cellular delivery of RNA-targeted molecules, which have strong therapeutic implications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
