In this work, we have found that the translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) in infected cells becomes phosphorylated early after virus infection and remains in this state throughout the virus replication cycle, leading to a further inhibition of cell protein synthesis. Under these restrictive conditions, however, the viral proteins and some cellular proteins are efficiently translated. The phosphorylation of eIF2α was shown to depend on the synthesis of three viral proteins, VP2, NSP2, and NSP5, since in cells in which the expression of any of these three proteins was knocked down by RNA interference, the translation factor was not phosphorylated. The modification of this factor is, however, not needed for the replication of the virus, since mutant cells that produce a nonphosphorylatable eIF2α sustained virus replication as efficiently as wild-type cells. In uninfected cells, the phosphorylation of eIF2α induces the formation of stress granules, aggregates of stalled translation complexes that prevent the translation of mRNAs. In rotavirus-infected cells, even though eIF2α is phosphorylated these granules are not formed, suggesting that the virus prevents the assembly of these structures to allow the translation of its mRNAs. Under these conditions, some of the cellular proteins that form part of these structures were found to change their intracellular localization, with some of them having dramatic changes, like the poly(A) binding protein, which relocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in infected cells, a relocation that depends on the viral protein NSP3.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
