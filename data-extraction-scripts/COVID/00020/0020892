Its high rate of disability and mortality has become a serious social and public health problem. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease in which genetic polymorphism interacts with environmental factors. Because the pathogenesis of asthma is not completely clear, there is no specific treatment. In 2010, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that lungs have many different microbial communities in both healthy and sick states. These microbial communities and respiratory mucosa constitute the respiratory mucosal microecology. When the respiratory mucosal microecology changes, it can play a key role in the occurrence and development of asthma and other respiratory diseases by regulating the immune mechanism. This paper reviews the latest research results in this field, and tries to explore the effects of changes in respiratory mucosal microecology on the pathogenesis of asthma, so as to provide new methods for early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of asthma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
