Of these viruses, HHV-6 is among the most successful human parasites, establishing lifelong infections in nearly 100% of individuals around the world. To better understand this host-pathogen relationship, we determined whether HHV-6 could interfere with the development of the innate antiviral response by affecting interferon (IFN) biosynthesis. Using inducible cell lines and transient transfection assays, we have identified the immediate-early 1 (IE1) protein as a potent inhibitor of IFN-β gene expression. IE1 proteins from both HHV-6 variants were capable of suppressing IFN-β gene induction. IE1 prevents IFN-β gene expression triggered by Sendai virus infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsDNA transfection, or the ectopic expression of IFN-β gene activators such as retinoic inducible gene I protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, TBK-1, IκB kinase ɛ (IKKɛ), and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). While the stability of IFN-β mRNA is not affected, IE1-expressing cells have reduced levels of dimerized IRF3 and nucleus-translocated IRF3 in response to activation by TBK-1 or IKKɛ. Using nuclear extracts and gel shift experiments, we could demonstrate that in the presence of IE1, IRF3 does not bind efficiently to the IFN-β promoter sequence. Overall, these results indicate that the IE1 protein of HHV-6, one of the first viral proteins synthesized upon viral entry, is a potent suppressor of IFN-β gene induction and likely contributes to favor the establishment of and successful infection of cells with this virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
