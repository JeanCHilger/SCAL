The NDV-BC F protein contains six potential acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation at residues 85, 191, 366, 447, 471, and 541 (sites Ng1 to Ng6, respectively). The sites at Ng2 and Ng5 are present in heptad repeat (HR) domains HR1 and HR2, respectively, and thus might affect fusion. Each N-glycosylation site was eliminated individually by replacing asparagine (N) with glutamine (Q), and a double mutant (Ng2 + 5) involving the two HR domains was also made. Each mutant was successfully recovered by reverse genetics except for the one involving Ng6, which is present in the cytoplasmic domain. All of the F proteins expressed by the recovered mutant viruses were efficiently cleaved and transported to the infected-cell surface. None of the individual mutations affected viral fusogenicity, but the double mutation at Ng2 and Ng5 in HR1 and HR2 increased fusogenicity >12-fold. The single mutations at sites Ng1, Ng2, and Ng5 resulted in modestly reduced multicycle growth in vitro. These three single mutations were also the most attenuating in eggs and 1-day-old chicks and were associated with decreased replication and spread in 2-week-old chickens. In contrast, the combination of the mutations at Ng2 and Ng5 yielded a virus that, compared to the BC parent, replicated >100-fold more efficiently in vitro, was more virulent in eggs and chicks, replicated more efficiently in chickens with enhanced tropism for the brain and gut, and elicited stronger humoral cell responses. These results illustrate the effects of N-glycosylation of the F protein on NDV pathobiology and suggest that the N-glycans in HR1 and HR2 coordinately downregulate viral fusion and virulence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
