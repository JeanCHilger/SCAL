OBJECTIVE: It is therefore advantageous to establish intracellular potency of anti-viral drug candidates early in the drug-discovery pipeline. METHODS: To this end, cell-based assays are being developed and employed in high-throughput drug screening, ranging from assays that monitor replication of intact viruses to those that monitor activity of specific viral proteins. While numerous cell-based assays have been developed and investigated, rapid counter screens are also needed to define the specific viral targets of identified inhibitors and to eliminate nonspecific screening hits. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Here, we describe the types of cell-based assays being used in antiviral drug screens and evaluate the equally important counter screens that are being employed to reach the full potential of cell-based high-throughput screening.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
