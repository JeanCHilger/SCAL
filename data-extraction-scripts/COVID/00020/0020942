L. monocytogenes is the only pathogen known to possess both the mevalonate and non-mevalonate isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways that produce metabolic phosphates or phosphoantigens activating human Vγ2Vδ2 T cells, making it interesting to explore in vivo anti-L. monocytogenes immune responses of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells. In this study, we demonstrated that subclinical systemic L. monocytogenes infection of rhesus macaques via parenteral inoculation or vaccination with an attenuated Listeria strain induced multieffector-functional immune responses of phosphoantigen-specific Vγ2Vδ2 T cells. Subclinical systemic infection and reinfection with attenuated L. monocytogenes uncovered the ability of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells to mount expansion and adaptive or recall-like expansion. Expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T cells could traffic to and accumulate in the pulmonary compartment and intestinal mucosa. Expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T cells could evolve into effector cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-17, or perforin after L. monocytogenes infection, and some effector Vγ2Vδ2 T cells could coproduce IL-17 and IFN-γ, IL-4 and IFN-γ, or TNF-α and perforin. Surprisingly, in vivo-expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T effector cells in subclinical L. monocytogenes infection could directly lyse L. monocytogenes-infected target cells and inhibit intracellular L. monocytogenes bacteria. Thus, we present the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of multieffector-functional Vγ2Vδ2 T cell responses against L. monocytogenes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
