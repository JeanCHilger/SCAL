Whereas previous reports have shown involvement of downstream signaling molecules in the innate immune system, the current study investigated the role of Aim2 as a sensor for DNA vaccines. The Aim2 inflammasome directs maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Both the humoral and cellular antigen-specific adaptive responses were significantly reduced in Aim2(−/−) mice in an IL-1β/IL-18 independent manner after DNA vaccination. Surprisingly, Aim2(−/−) mice also exhibited significantly lower levels of IFN-α/β at the site of injection. These results indicate a previously unreported link between DNA vaccine induced pyroptotic cell death and vaccine immunogenicity that is instrumental in shaping the antigen specific immune response to DNA vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
