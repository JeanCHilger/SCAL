<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-12</DATELINE><TITLE>A Snapshot of Influenza Surveillance, Vaccine Recommendations, and Vaccine Access, Drivers, and Barriers in Selected Middle Eastern and North African Countries</TITLE><BODY>OBJECTIVES: Influenza is a vaccine-preventable acute respiratory viral infection that causes epidemics annually around the globe. A regional influenza stakeholder network (MENA-ISN) comprised of experts assessed the status of influenza prevention and control using a structured survey. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was used to obtain information from each participating country on surveillance system, the burden of disease, influenza vaccination programs, recommendations, funding and access for vaccine and vaccination, target rate, coverage rate monitoring, and drivers and barriers to influenza vaccination. RESULTS: Out of the 10 countries that participated, nine had an influenza surveillance system and vaccination policy, and seven had World Health Organization (WHO) accredited reference laboratory. Three countries had burden of disease data available and eight had a reimbursement vaccine policy. Influenza vaccine was available in five countries through the Ministry of Health whereas in others, pharmacies also dispensed for the private sector. In all countries, prescribers were physicians, and vaccinators, which could be physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Eight countries had a set vaccination target rate and only three monitored the influenza coverage rates. Drivers and barriers of vaccination were similar in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Despite existing policies, influenza vaccination coverage remains far below the WHO recommendations. Increased awareness and effective implementation of policies with collaboration of stakeholders can help increase the rates to reach WHO targets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
