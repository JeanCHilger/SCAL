Sequence analysis of a short fragment in the polymerase complex indicated the clonal origin of the strains, which were similar to the prototype canine NoV strain GIV.2/Bari/170/07-4/ITA (94.7% nucleotide identity). The findings demonstrate that canine NoV circulates in dogs in Greece and that it can spread easily across a group of animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
