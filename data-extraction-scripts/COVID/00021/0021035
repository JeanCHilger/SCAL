METHODS: This prospective observational study was approved by the ethical committee of the University Clinic of Santiago de Compostela. Informed consent was asked from patients receiving M-PC. M-PCs were treated with the Mirasol system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thrombocytopenic patients were transfused according to the Spanish transfusion guidelines. Post-transfusion platelet counts were measured at 1 h and/or 24 h after transfusion. Post-transfusion surveillance of patients was maintained during the study. RESULTS: Data from 54 evaluable patients and 135 transfusions were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years. The mean age of M-PC at transfusion was 3.6 days. The mean platelet dose was 3.7 × 10(11). The transfusion responses measured as mean corrected count increment 1 h after transfusion (CCI(1h)) and CCI(24h) were 9,659 and 4,751, respectively. 65% of transfusions resulted in CCI(1h) values ≥ 7,500. 51% of transfusions resulted in CCI(24h) values ≥ 4,500. CONCLUSION: The use of M-PC in the supportive treatment proved to be safe and effective for this cohort of thrombocytopenic patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
