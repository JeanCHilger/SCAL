This review summarizes and comments on the opportunities for broad-spectrum agents that are active against a range of flaviviruses. Broad-spectrum activity would be particularly desirable as preparatory measure for the next flaviviral epidemic that could emerge from as-yet-unknown or neglected viruses. Potential target sites for broad-spectrum anti-flaviviral compounds include viral proteins and host mechanisms that are exploited by these viruses during entry and replication. A variety of compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity have already been identified by target-specific or phenotypic assays. For some other compound classes, broad-spectrum activity can be anticipated because of their mode of action and molecular target(s).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
