Members of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family stand out among the specialized receptors utilized by myeloid cells to orchestrate these responses. CLR ligands include carbohydrate, protein and lipid components of both pathogens and self, which variably trigger endocytic, phagocytic, pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory reactions. These varied outcomes rely on a versatile system for CLR signaling that includes tyrosine based motifs that recruit kinases, phosphatases or endocytic adaptors, as well as non-tyrosine based signals that modulate the activation of other pathways or couple to the uptake machinery. Here, we review the signaling properties of myeloid CLRs and how they impact the role of myeloid cells in innate and adaptive immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
