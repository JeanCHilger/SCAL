In this review, we detail the ePlex platform and its current/future syndromic panels, with a particular focus on the respiratory pathogen panel – the platform's first assay to undergo clinical trials and receive regulatory approval in the USA. By keeping informed of these ever-expanding laboratory options, clinicians and microbiologists can stay positioned at the forefront of infectious disease diagnosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
