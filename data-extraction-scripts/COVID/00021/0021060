<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Polypyrrole-peptide microarray for biomolecular interaction analysis by SPR imaging</TITLE><BODY>Nowadays, high-throughput analysis of biological events is a great challenge which could take benefit of the recent development of microarray devices. The great potential of such technology is related to the availability of a chip bearing a large set of probes, stable and easy to obtain, and suitable for ligand binding detection. Here, we described a new method based on polypyrrole chemistry and allowing the covalent immobilization of peptides in a microarray format and on a gold surface compatible with the use of Surface Plasmon Resonance. This technique is then illustrated by the detection and characterization of antibodies induced by hepatitis C virus and present in patientsâ€™serums.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
