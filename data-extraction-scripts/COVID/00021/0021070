<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-01-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): Emergence of a pathogenic human Coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>In 2012, a zoonotic coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), called MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since then, the virus has infected 1728 patients as of 12 May 2016, with a mortality rate of 36%. While MERS-CoV generally causes subclinical or mild disease, infection can result in serious outcomes, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with co-morbidities. The virus is endemic in camels in the Arabian peninsula and Africa and thus poses a consistent threat of frequent reintroduction into human populations. Disease prevalence will increase substantially if the virus mutates to increase human-to-human transmissibility. No therapeutics or vaccines are approved for MERS; thus, development of novel therapies is needed. Further, since many MERS cases are acquired in healthcare settings, public health measures and scrupulous attention to infection control practices are required to prevent additional MERS outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
