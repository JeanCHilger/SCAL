The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV was identified as the etiologic agent of the 2002-3 international SARS outbreak. Yet how SARS evades innate immune responses to cause human disease remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a protein encoded by SARS-CoV designated as open reading frame-9b (ORF-9b) localizes to mitochondria and causes mitochondrial elongation by triggering ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of dynamin-like protein (DRP1), a host protein involved in mitochondrial fission. Also, acting on mitochondria ORF-9b targets the mitochondrial-associated adaptor molecule MAVS signalosome by usurping poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and the HECT domain E3 ligase AIP4 to trigger the degradation of MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF6. This severely limits host cell interferon responses. Reducing either PCBP2 or AIP4 expression substantially reversed the ORF-9b mediated reduction of MAVS and the suppression of anti-viral transcriptional responses. Finally, transient ORF-9b expression led to a strong induction of autophagy in cells. The induction of autophagy depended upon ATG5, a critical autophagy regulator, but the inhibition of MAVS signaling did not. These results indicate that SARS-CoV ORF-9b manipulates host cell mitochondria and mitochondrial function to help evade host innate immunity. This study has uncovered an important clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and illustrates the havoc that a small open reading frame can cause in cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
