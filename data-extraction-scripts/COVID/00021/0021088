In the last few years, rapid progress has been made in mechanistically characterizing both processes and also revealing that trans-acting factors play important regulatory roles in frameshifting. Here, we review recent biophysical studies that bring new molecular insights to stop codon readthrough and frameshifting. Lastly, we consider whether there may be common mechanistic themes in âˆ’1 and +1 frameshifting based on recent X-ray crystal structures of +1 frameshift-prone tRNAs bound to the ribosome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
