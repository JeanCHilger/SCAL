In the present study, we performed detailed genome analysis of CyunNPV and compared its genome to those of other Group I alphabaculoviruses. Sequencing of the CyunNPV genome using the Roche 454 sequencing system generated 142,900 bp with a G + C content of 45%. Genome analysis predicted a total of 147 hypothetical open reading frames comprising 38 baculoviral core genes, 24 lepidopteran baculovirus conserved genes, nine Group I Alphabaculovirus conserved genes, 71 common genes, and five genes that are unique to CyunNPV. In addition, the genome contains 13 homologous repeated sequences (hrs). Phylogenetic analysis groups CyunNPV under a distinct branch within clade “a” of Group I in the genus Alphabaculovirus. Unlike other members of Group I, CyunNPV harbors only nine of the 11 genes previously determined to be specific to Group I viruses. Furthermore, the CyunNPV lacks the tyrosine phosphatase gene and the ac30 gene. The CyunNPV F-like protein contains two insertions of continuous polar amino acids, one at the conventional fusion peptide and a second insertion at the pre-transmembrane domain. The insertions are likely to affect the fusion function and suggest an evolutionary process that led to inactivation of the F-like protein. The above findings imply that CyunNPV is a distinct species under Group I Alphabaculovirus.
