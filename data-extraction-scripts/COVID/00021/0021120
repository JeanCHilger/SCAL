Although prefusion and postfusion crystal structures have been solved for many of these proteins, details about how they transition between these states have remained elusive. This work presents the first, to our knowledge, computational survey of transitions between pre- and postfusion configurations for several class I viral fusion proteins using structure-based models to analyze their dynamics. As suggested by their structural similarities, all proteins share common mechanistic features during their transitions that can be characterized by a diffusive rotational search followed by cooperative N- and C-terminal zipping. Instead of predicting a stable spring-loaded intermediate, our model suggests that helical bundle formation is mediated by N- and C-terminal interactions late in the transition. Shared transition features suggest a global mechanism in which fusion is activated by slow protein-core rotation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
