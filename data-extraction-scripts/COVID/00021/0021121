In this study we have investigated the mechanisms by which VPA inhibits LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. VPA reduced production of infectious LCMV progeny and virus propagation without exerting a major blockage on either viral RNA or protein synthesis, but rather affecting the cell release and specific infectivity of LCMV progeny from infected cells. Our results would support the repurposing of VPA as a candidate antiviral drug to combat arenavirus infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
