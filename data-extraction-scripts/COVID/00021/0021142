METHODS: Amniotic fluid (AF) samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 231 asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix [cervical length (CL) ≤25 mm] were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anaerobic as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The frequency and magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an AF interleukin (IL)-6 concentration ≥2.6 ng/mL], acute histologic placental inflammation, spontaneous preterm delivery, and the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval were examined according to the results of AF cultures, PCR/ESI-MS and AF IL-6 concentrations. RESULTS: Ten percent (24/231) of patients with a sonographic short cervix had sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (an elevated AF IL-6 concentration without evidence of microorganisms using cultivation and molecular methods). Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was significantly more frequent than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation [10.4% (24/231) vs. 2.2% (5/231); p<0.001]. Patients with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation had a significantly higher rate of spontaneous preterm delivery <34 weeks of gestation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 31.6% (55/174); p<0.001] and a significantly shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery interval than patients without intra-amniotic inflammation [median 35, (IQR: 10 – 70) vs. median 71, (IQR: 47 – 98) days, (p<0.0001)]. CONCLUSION: Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation is more common than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation in asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix, and is associated with increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (<34 weeks). Further investigation is required to determine the causes of sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and the mechanisms whereby this condition is associated with a short cervix and spontaneous preterm delivery.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
