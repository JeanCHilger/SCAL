Clinical characteristics of URIs complicated by ABS in young children have not been well studied. METHODS: We identified ABS episodes in a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 294 children (6 to 35 months of age at enrollment), who were followed-up for one year to capture all URI episodes and complications. At the initial URI visit seen by the study personnel (median day=4 from symptoms onset), nasopharyngeal samples were obtained for bacterial cultures and viral studies. RESULTS: Of 1295 documented URI episodes, 103 (8%) episodes (in 73 children) were complicated by ABS, 32 of which were concurrent with acute otitis media. The majority (72%) of ABS episodes were diagnosed based on persistent symptoms or a biphasic course. Average age at ABS diagnosis was 18.8±7.2 months; white children were more likely to have ABS episodes than blacks (p=0.01). Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (p<0.0001) was negatively associated, and adequate PCV-7 immunization status (p=0.001) appeared to increase the risk of ABS. Girls had more ABS episodes than boys (0.5±0.8 vs 0.3±0.6 episodes/year, respectively, p=0.03). Viruses were detected in 63% during the initial URI visit; rhinovirus detection was positively correlated with ABS risk (p=0.01). Bacterial cultures were positive in 82/83 (99%) available samples obtained at the initial URI visit; polymicrobial (56%), Moraxella catarrhalis (20%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) were the most common cultures. Presence of pathogenic bacteria overall and presence of M. catarrhalis during URI were positively correlated with the risk for ABS (p=0.04 for both). CONCLUSION: ABS complicates 8% of URI in young children. Girls have more frequent ABS episodes than boys. Presence of rhinovirus and M. catarrhalis during URI are positively correlated with the risk for ABS complication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
