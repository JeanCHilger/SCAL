In this study, we systematically examined the 3 B19V nonstructural proteins, 7.5kDa, 11kDa, and NS1, for their function in inducing apoptosis in transfection of primary ex vivoâ€“expanded erythroid progenitor cells, in comparison with apoptosis induced during B19V infection. Our results show that 11kDa is a more significant inducer of apoptosis than NS1, whereas 7.5kDa does not induce apoptosis. Furthermore, we determined that caspase-10, an initiator caspase in death receptor signaling, is the most active caspase in apoptotic erythroid progenitors induced by 11kDa and NS1 as well as during B19V infection. More importantly, cytoplasm-localized 11kDa is expressed at least 100 times more than nucleus-localized NS1 at the protein level in primary erythroid progenitor cells infected with B19V; and inhibition of 11kDa expression using antisense oligos targeting specifically to the 11kDa-encoding mRNAs reduces apoptosis significantly during B19V infection of erythroid progenitor cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the 11kDa protein contributes to erythroid progenitor cell death during B19V infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
