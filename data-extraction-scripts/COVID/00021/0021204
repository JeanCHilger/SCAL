<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Plant as a plenteous reserve of lectin</TITLE><BODY>Lectins are clusters of glycoproteins of nonimmune foundation that combine specifically and reversibly to carbohydrates, mainly the sugar moiety of glycoconjugates, resulting in cell agglutination and precipitation of glycoconjugates. They are universally distributed in nature, being established in plants, fungi, viruses, bacteria, crustacea, insects, and animals, but leguminacae plants are rich source of lectins. The present review reveals the structure, biological properties, and application of plant lectins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
