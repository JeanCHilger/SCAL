The wide functional purview of S-nitrosylation reflects in part the regulation by S-nitrosylation of the principal protein post-translational modifications that play a role in cell signaling, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation and related modifications, palmitoylation, and alternative Cys-based redox modifications. In this minireview, we discuss the mechanisms through which S-nitrosylation exerts its broad pleiotropic influence on protein post-translational modification.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
