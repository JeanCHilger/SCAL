We characterized two important features of HBoV1 infection in polarized primary human airway epithelia (HAE). Apical HBoV1 infection of HAE at a low multiplicity of infection causes disruption of the tight junction barrier, loss of cilia, and epithelial cell hypertrophy, which are hallmarks of the airway epithelial damage caused by HBoV1 infection. HBoV1 also infects HAE from the basolateral surface productively, although less efficiently, and this also leads to the characteristic airway epithelial damage.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
