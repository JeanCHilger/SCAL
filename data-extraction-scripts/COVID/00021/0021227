This hampers their ability to prevent nosocomial infections, identify emerging pathogens and rapidly alert officials to possible outbreaks. The lack of dedicated and trained IC practitioners (ICPs) is a serious deficit in the health care workforce, and is worsened by the lack of institutions that offer IC training. Discussion: While no single individual can entirely eliminate the risk of nosocomial transmission, there is literature to support the value of designated IC persons. Recommendations from the World Health Organization in 2008 and 2009 describe the need for this specialized cadre of workers, but many countries lack the national regulations to authorize, train and manage such professionals at the national or local level. This article provides an overview of how ICPs are trained and credentialed in several countries, and discusses approaches countries can use to train ICPs. Conclusion: Trained ICPs can help prevent future outbreaks and control nosocomial transmission of diseases in health care facilities. For this to occur, supportive national policies, availability of training institutions and local administrative support will be required.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
