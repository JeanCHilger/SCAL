<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Evolution and population genomics of the Lyme borreliosis pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi</TITLE><BODY>Population genomic studies have the potential to address many unresolved questions about microbial pathogens by facilitating the identification of genes underlying ecologically important traits such as novel virulence factors and adaptations to humans or other host species. Additionally, this framework improves estimations of population demography and evolutionary history to accurately reconstruct recent epidemics and identify the molecular and environmental factors that resulted in the outbreak. The Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, exemplifies the power and promise of the application of population genomics to microbial pathogens. We discuss here the future of evolutionary studies in B.burgdorferi - focusing on the primary evolutionary forces of horizontal gene transfer, natural selection, and migration - as investigations transition from analyses of single genes to genomes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
