In this report, the role of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in membrane fusion was investigated by generating chimeric constructs in which these regions were replaced with analogous domains from other molecules and by introducing amino acid substitutions within the membrane-spanning sequence. gH molecules which lack the authentic transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail were unable to mediate cell-cell fusion when coexpressed with gB, gD, and gL and were unable to rescue the infectivity of a gH-null virus as efficiently as a wild-type gH molecule. Many amino acid substitutions of specific amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain also affected cell-cell fusion, in particular, those introduced at a conserved glycine residue. Some gH mutants that were impaired in cell-cell fusion were nevertheless able to rescue the infectivity of a gH-negative virus, but these pseudotyped virions entered cells more slowly than wild-type virions. These results indicate that the fusion event mediated by the coexpression of gHL, gB, and gD in cells shares common features with the fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane, they point to a likely role for the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in both processes, and they suggest that a conserved glycine residue in the membrane-spanning sequence is crucial for efficient fusion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
