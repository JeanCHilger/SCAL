This study was performed to investigate the clinical significance of the serum albumin/globulin ratio (AGR) in elderly patients with AECOPD. METHODS: The data of 252 hospitalized elderly patients with AECOPD, 89 stable COPD patients and 115 elderly healthy individuals were analyzed and compared. The differences in the AGR, logarithm of the serum C-reactive protein (LogCRP) level, prealbumin (PA) level, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) level were compared. AECOPD patients were grouped using the optimal cutoff values of each index to compare the difference in the combined infection rate. The correlation between hospital stays and AGR was analyzed. RESULTS: The AGR, LogCRP, PA level, and IgG level were different among the AECOPD group, stable COPD group and healthy control groups (P<0.05). The AGR, LogCRP, and PA level were different (P<0.05) among the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) I, II, II, and IV groups. Age, AGR, LogCRP, and PA level were different (P<0.05) between the infection and non-infection groups. After grouping according to the optimal cutoff values, the combined infection rate was different (P<0.05). The AGR was negatively correlated with the hospital stay (r=−0.583, P<0.001). The hospital stay was longer in patients with an AGR of <1.37 than ≥1.37 (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The AGR can be regarded as a reference index for evaluating the condition of elderly patients with AECOPD, determining the presence of combined infection, and predicting the prognosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
