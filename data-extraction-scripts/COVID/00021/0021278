Current diagnostics for detecting CyHV-3 are limited in sensitivity and are further complicated by latency. Here we describe the detection of CyHV-3 by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). The RPA assay can detect as low as 10 copies of CyHV-3 genome by an isothermal reaction and yields results in approximately 20 minutes. Using the RPA assay, CyHV-3 genome can be detected in total DNA of white blood cells isolated from koi latently infected with CyHV-3, while less than 10% of the latently infected koi can be detected by a real-time PCR assay in total DNA of white blood cells. In addition, RPA products can be detected in a lateral flow device that is cheap, fast, and can be used outside of the diagnostic lab. The RPA assay and lateral flow device provide for the rapid, sensitive, and specific amplification of CyHV-3 that with future modifications for field use and validation could lead to enhanced surveillance and early diagnosis of CyHV-3 in the laboratory and field.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
