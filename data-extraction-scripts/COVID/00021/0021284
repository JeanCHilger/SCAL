Here we demonstrate that, following in vitro stimulation of human peripheral blood NK cells with a variety of microbial ligands, CD56(dim) as well as CD56(bright) NK cells contribute to the overall NK cell IFN-γ response with, for most cell donors, IFN-γ(+) CD56(dim) NK cells outnumbering IFN-γ(+) CD56(bright) NK cells. We also observe that the magnitude of the human NK IFN-γ response to microbial ligands varies between individuals; that the antimicrobial response of CD56(bright), but not CD56(dim), NK cells is highly correlated with that of myeloid accessory cells; and that the ratio of IFN-γ(+) CD56(dim) to IFN-γ(+) CD56(bright) NK cells following microbial stimulation differs between individuals but remains constant for a given donor over time. Furthermore, ratios of IFN-γ(+) CD56(dim) to IFN-γ(+) CD56(bright) NK cells for different microbial stimuli are highly correlated and the relative response of CD56(dim) and CD56(bright) NK cells is highly significantly associated with killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype. These data reveal an influence of KIR genotype, possibly mediated via NK cell licensing, on the ability of NK cells to respond to non-viral infections and have implications for genetic regulation of susceptibility to infection in humans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
