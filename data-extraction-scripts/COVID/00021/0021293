Monolayers of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected to stably express human ACE and bradykinin B(2) receptors coupled to green fluorescent protein (B(2)GFP) or to express only coupled B(2)GFP receptors. We used 2 ACE-resistant bradykinin analogues to activate the B(2) receptors. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to analyze the peptides cleaved by ACE on cell monolayers and found that Ang 1-9 was hydrolyzed 18× slower than Ang I and ≈30% slower than Ang 1-7. Ang 1-7 was cleaved to Ang 1-5. Although μmol/L concentrations of slowly cleaved substrates Ang 1-7 and Ang 1-9 inhibit ACE, they resensitize the desensitized B(2)GFP receptors in nmol/L concentration, independent of ACE inhibition. This is reflected by release of arachidonic acid through a mechanism involving cross-talk between ACE and B(2) receptors. When ACE was not expressed, the Ang 1-9, Ang 1-7 peptides were inactive. Inhibitors of protein kinase C-α, phosphatases and Tyr-kinase blocked this resensitization activity, but not basal B(2) activation by bradykinin. Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7 enhance bradykinin activity, probably by acting as endogenous allosteric modifiers of the ACE and B(2) receptor complex. Consequently, when ACE inhibitors block conversion of Ang I, other enzymes can still release Ang I metabolites to enhance the efficacy of ACE inhibitors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
