Free ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates function in diverse cellular pathways, particularly regulation of antiviral innate immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that ISG15 overexpression inhibits porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication in cell culture and that the antiviral activity of interferon is reduced by inhibition of ISG15 conjugation. PRRSV nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) was previously identified as a potential antagonist of ISG15 production and conjugation. The protein contains a papain-like protease domain (PLP2) that plays a crucial role in the proteolytic cleavage of the PRRSV replicase polyproteins. PLP2 was also proposed to belong to the ovarian tumor domain-containing superfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which is capable of inhibiting ISG15 production and counteracting ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins. To determine whether this immune antagonist function could be selectively inactivated, we engineered a panel of mutants with deletions and/or mutations at the N-terminal border of the nsp2 PLP2-DUB domain. A 23-amino-acid deletion (amino acids 402 to 424 of the ORF1a-encoded protein) largely abolished the inhibitory effect of nsp2 on ISG15 production and conjugation, but no viable recombinant virus was recovered. A 19-amino-acid deletion (amino acids 402 to 420), in combination with a downstream point mutation (S465A), partially relieved the ISG15 antagonist function and yielded a viable recombinant virus. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ISG15 and ISGylation play an important role in the response to PRRSV infection and that nsp2 is a key factor in counteracting the antiviral function of ISG15.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
