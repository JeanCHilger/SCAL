The objective of this study was to determine if macrophages from these two strains had altered cholesterol metabolism that might play a role in their divergent atherosclerosis susceptibility. APPROACH AND RESULTS: AKR and DBA/2 macrophages incubated with acetylated LDL (AcLDL) resulted in higher cholesterol ester (CE) and lower free cholesterol (FC) accumulation in the DBA/2 cells. However, these strains had equivalent AcLDL uptake and cholesterol esterification activity. Cholesterol efflux from unloaded cells to apoAI or HDL was similar in the two strains. However, upon AcLDL loading, cholesterol efflux was impaired in the DBA/2 cells, but this impairment was corrected by loading in the presence of an inhibitor of cholesterol esterification. Thus, the cholesterol efflux capabilities are similar in these strains, but there appeared to be a defect in lipid droplet (LD)-stored CE mobilization in DBA/2 cells. Lalistat-1, a specific inhibitor of lysosomal acid lipase, completely blocked the hydrolysis of LD-stored CE, implying that LD autophagy is responsible for CE turnover in these cells. CE turnover was 2-fold slower in DBA/2 vs. AKR cells. Autophagic flux, estimated by a fluorescent LC3-II reporter and the increase in p62 levels after chloroquine treatment, was higher in AKR vs. DBA/2 macrophages, which had an apparent decrease in autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. When autophagy was activated by amino acid starvation, CE levels decreased in DBA/2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Physiological regulation of autophagy in macrophages controls CE accumulation and may modify atherosclerosis susceptibility.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
