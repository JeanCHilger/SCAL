We designed and synthesized an imaging agent which contains a NIR fluorochrome (IR780) and peptidyl fluoromethyl ketone (FMK) for caspase-9 imaging of cells undergoing apoptosis. The IR780-FMK fluorescent probe had a Strokes shift of 79 nm and quantum yield 0.75. Prostate cancer DU145 cells undergoing apoptosis were successfully imaged using as little as 0.1 Î¼M of IR780-FMK.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
