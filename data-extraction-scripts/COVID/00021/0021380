DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study of patients with severe hypoxemia at a University-affiliated Level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: Patients diagnosed with severe ARDS within 72 hours of ICU admission between 1/1/2008 and 12/31/2011. METHODS: Data were abstracted from the medical record and included demographic and clinical variables, hospital and ICU length of stay, discharge disposition, and hospital costs. Patient-level data were linked to the Washington State Death Registry. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox's proportional hazards models were used to estimate survival and hazard ratios. MAIN RESULTS: 428 patients meeting study inclusion criteria were identified; 62 (14%) were initiated on a rescue therapy. PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratios were comparable at admission between patients treated with a rescue therapy and those treated conventionally, but were substantially lower by 72 hours in those who received rescue therapies (54 ± 17 versus 69 ± 17 mmHg; p<.01). For the entire cohort, estimated survival probability at three years was 55% (95% CI: 51%, 61%). Among 280 hospital survivors (65%), three-year survival was 85% (95% CI: 80%, 89%). The relative hazard of in-hospital mortality was 68% higher among patients who received rescue therapy compared to patients treated conventionally (95% CI: 8%, 162%; p=0.02). For long-term survival, the hazard ratio of death following ICU admission was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.37; p=0.04), comparing rescue versus conventional treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high hospital mortality, severe ARDS patients surviving to hospital discharge have relatively good long-term survival. Worsening hypoxemia was associated with initiation of rescue therapy. Patients on rescue therapy had higher in-hospital mortality; however, survivors to hospital discharge had long-term survival that was comparable to other ARDS survivors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
