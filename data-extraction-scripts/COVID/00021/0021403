<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-08-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Generation of Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses</TITLE><BODY>This unit describes how to infect cells with vaccinia virus and then transfect them with a plasmid-transfer vector or PCR fragment to generate a recombinant virus. Selection and screening methods used to isolate recombinant viruses and a method for the amplification of recombinant viruses are described. Finally, a method for live immunostaining that has been used primarily for detection of recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
