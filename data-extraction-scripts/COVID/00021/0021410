Vaccines offer an exciting strategy for the treatment of cocaine addiction; however, vaccine formulations need to be optimized to improve efficacy. Herein, we examine the effectiveness of a tricomponent cocaine vaccine, defined as having its hapten (GNE) and adjuvant (cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826, CpG ODN 1826) covalently linked via the immunogenic protein ovalbumin (OVA). The tricomponent vaccine (GNE-OVA-CpG 1826) and a vaccine of analogous, individual components (GNE-OVA + CpG ODN) were found to similarly induce highly specific anticocaine antibody production in mice and block cocaineâ€™s stimulant effects in hyperlocomotor testing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
