This conversion, and ultimately disease development, depends on the molecular switch protein, ZEBRA, a viral bZIP transcription factor that initiates transcription from promoters of viral lytic genes. By binding to the origin of viral replication, ZEBRA is also an essential replication protein. Here, we identified a novel DNA-binding motif of ZEBRA, N terminal to the canonical bZIP domain. This RRTRK motif is important for high-affinity binding to DNA and is essential for recognizing the methylation state of viral promoters. Mutations in this motif lead to deficiencies in DNA binding, recognition of DNA methylation, lytic cycle DNA replication, and viral late gene expression. This work advances our understanding of ZEBRA-dependent activation of the viral lytic cascade. IMPORTANCE The binding of ZEBRA to methylated and unmethylated viral DNA triggers activation of the EBV lytic cycle, leading to viral replication and, in some patients, cancer development. Our work thoroughly examines how ZEBRA uses a previously unrecognized basic motif to bind nonmethylated and methylated DNA targets, leading to viral lytic activation. Our findings show that two different positively charged motifs, including the canonical BZIP domain and a newly identified RRTRK motif, contribute to the mechanism of DNA recognition by a viral AP-1 protein. This work contributes to the assessment of ZEBRA as a potential therapeutic target for antiviral and oncolytic treatments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
