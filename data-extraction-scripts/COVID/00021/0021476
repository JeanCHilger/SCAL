The aim of the present study was to investigate dynamic fluctuations of peripheral blood immune cell subgroups in patients with critical H7N9 infection. Flow cytometry was used to assess the cells in whole blood samples from 9 cases. With regard to the innate immune system, in the majority of patients, the natural killer (NK) cell counts were similar to those of monocytes, which demonstrated a gradual increase in the progression period and an early increase followed by a reduction during recovery. B cells exhibited a reduction during progression and were further decreased during recovery. The CD4(+)T cells of all patients decreased during progression, and further decreased during recovery. By contrast, CD8(+)T cells increased in the majority of patients in the progression stage, and underwent an initial reduction followed by a gradual increase during recovery. However, CD8(+) programmed death (PD)-1(+)T cell and T helper (Th) 1 cell frequencies demonstrated a moderate increase in all patients during the progression stage, and regulatory T cell (Treg) frequencies tended to be reduced during progression and increased during recovery. Notably, this preliminary data also showed that the frequencies of B cells, Th2 cells and Th17 cells in the progression period were higher than those in the recovery period. The frequencies of monocytes, CD4(+)T cell, CD8(+)T cell, CD4(+)PD-1(+)T cells and CD8(+)PD-1(+)T cells in the progression period were lower than those during recovery. In conclusion, different levels of peripheral blood immune cell subgroups during the pathogenesis of H7N9 infection may be associated with elimination of the virus and immune damage.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
