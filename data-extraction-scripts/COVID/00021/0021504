We developed a simple method for the selective activation of memory B cells in total fresh or frozen PBMC using a combination of R848 and IL-2. In these conditions 30â€“40% of memory B cells generated clones producing on average 200 ng IgG in 10 days. This method was used to measure the frequency of antigen specific memory B cells as well as the fine specificity, crossreactivity and neutralizing activity of the secreted antibodies. Following influenza vaccination, specific B cells expanded dramatically, reaching up to 50% of total clonable memory B cells on day 14. Specific B cell expansions were detected also in individuals that did not show a significant serological response. Dynamic changes and persistence of B cells specific for a variety of pathogens were documented in serial PBMC samples collected over almost two decades. These results reveal novel aspects of memory B cell kinetics and provide a powerful tool to monitor immune responses following infection and vaccination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
