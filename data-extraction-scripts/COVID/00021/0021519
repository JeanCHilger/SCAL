Recent advances in conditioning regimens, opportunistic infection prophylaxis, diagnostic tools, and treatment modalities have broadly impacted our understanding of LRTI among these vulnerable patients. In this review, the most common bacteria, viruses, and fungi causing LRTI in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
