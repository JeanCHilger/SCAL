The domestic cat is a prominent host, with reports of astroviral infection being both highly prevalent and widely distributed in the feline population. Despite the potential for inducing significant disease, especially within shelter environments, there is currently only one reliable method of detection: standard reverse-transcription PCR using pan-astrovirus degenerate primers (consensus RT-PCR) with product sequencing. Unfortunately, this process is relatively slow and costly. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) represents an efficient, economical alternative, with the added benefit of viral load quantification. We developed a RT-qPCR assay using probe hybridization technique to detect conserved regions of mamastrovirus 2 extracted from fecal samples of domestic cats. Known positive and negative samples were tested, and results were compared with gold standard consensus RT-PCR and sequencing. A standard curve was employed to determine limits of detection. In order to assess analytic specificity, we tested several additional samples that had been collected from non-felid species and were known to contain non-target astroviruses. Discrepant results between consensus RT-PCR and RT-qPCR testing were further analyzed with a validation RT-PCR assay, using mamastrovirus 2â€“specific primers. Our probe hybridization RT-qPCR assay is reliable and effective for the detection of mamastrovirus 2. This assay will allow rapid, affordable detection and facilitate further research on astroviral infection within domestic cats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
