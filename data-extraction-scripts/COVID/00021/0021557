<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Osteonecrosis in Children After Therapy for Malignancy</TITLE><BODY>OBJECTIVE: Osteonecrosis in the growing population of childhood cancer survivors results from disease and treatment. Imagers must be knowledgeable about patient groups at risk for its development, patterns of involvement and potential implications. This review will focus on implications of this potentially life-altering toxicity. CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for developing osteonecrosis. Because osteonecrosis is often asymptomatic until late in the process, imaging is critical for its detection and characterization when interventions may be most effective to ameliorate its progression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
