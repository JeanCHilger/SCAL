The attachment of bacteria expressing Dr adhesins to DAF induces clustering of DAF around bacterial cells, and also recruitment of CEA - related cell adhesion molecules. (CEA, CEACAM1, CEACAM3 and CEACAM6) have been shown to serve as receptors for some Dr adhesins (DraE, DaaE, and AfaE-III). We demonstrate that DraE, DaaE, AfaE-V and AfaE-I adhesins bind to the N-domain of CEA. We utilized binding analysis of naturally occuring Dr variants and constructed mutants, an nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis to identify the amino acids of DraE and CEA involved in binding interactions. We identified distinct binding sites for DAF and CEA on opposite faces of the adhesin. These findings imply that the adhesin could be bound simultaneously by both receptors on the epithelial cell surface. The occurrence at high frequency of point mutations in the amino acids of Dr adhesins involved in CEA binding indicate that interaction with these receptors play an important role in niche adaptation of E. coli expressing Dr adhesins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
