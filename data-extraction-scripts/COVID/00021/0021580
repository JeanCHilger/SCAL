In mice, optimal protection to VRTI is mediated by recruitment of effector T cells to the lungs and respiratory tract, and subsequent establishment of tissue resident memory T cells (Trm) which provide longterm protection. These critical processes of T cell recruitment to the respiratory tract, their role in disease pathogenesis, and establishment of local protective immunity remain undefined in pediatric VRTI. Here we investigated T cell responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract (URT and LRT, respectively) of infants and young children with VRTI, revealing developmental regulation of T cell differentiation and Trm generation in situ. We show a direct concurrence between T cell responses in the URT and LRT, including a preponderance of effector CD8(+)T cells that was associated with disease severity. During infant VRTI, there was an accumulation of terminally differentiated effector cells (Temra) in the URT and LRT with reduced Trm in the early neonatal period, with decreased Temra and increased Trm formation with age during the early years of childhood. Moreover, human infant T cells exhibit increased expression of the transcription factor T-bet compared to adult T cells, suggesting a mechanism for preferential generation of effector over Trm cells. The developmental regulation of respiratory T cell responses as revealed here is important for diagnosing, monitoring and treating VRTI in the critical early life stages.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
