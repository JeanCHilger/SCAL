In this study, we identified the role of excessive glutamate stimulation in the modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), a critical component in the compensatory axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In primary cultured cortical neurons, high concentration of glutamate (100 μM) significantly reduced the enzymatic activity of ACE2. The elevated activity of ADAM17, a member of the ‘A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease’ (ADAM) family, was found to contribute to this glutamate-induced ACE2 down-regulation. The decrease of ACE2 activity could be prevented by pre-treatment with antagonists targeting ionotropic glutamate receptors. In addition, the glutamate-induced decrease in ACE2 activity was significantly attenuated when the neurons were co-treated with MitoTEMPOL or blockers that target oxidative stress-mediated signaling pathway. In summary, our study reveals a strong relationship between excessive glutamate stimulation and ADAM17-mediated impairment in ACE2 activity, suggesting a possible cross-talk between glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and dysregulated RAS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
