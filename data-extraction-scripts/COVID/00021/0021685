These diseases are the global burden and the prominent cause for the worldwide deaths and disability. Nanomedicine has emerged as the most excellent tool to eradicate and halt their spread. Various nanoformulations (NFs) using advanced nanotechnology are in demand. Recently, hydrogel and nanogel based drug delivery devices poses new prospects to simulate the natural intelligence of various biological systems. Owing to their unique porous interpenetrating network design, hydrophobic drug incorporation and stimulus sensitivity hydrogels owe excellent potential as targeted drug delivery system. Present review is an attempt to highlight the recent trends of hydrogel based drug delivery systems for the delivery of therapeutic agents and diagnostics for the major infectious diseases including Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Malaria, Tuberculosis, Influenza and Ebola. Future prospective and challenges are also briefed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
