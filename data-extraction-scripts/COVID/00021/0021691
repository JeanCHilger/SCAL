Adoptive transfer of MHV-immune splenocytes depleted of either CD4 or CD8 T cells to infected mice deficient in recombination activation gene 1 resulted in demyelination. We showed previously that the process of CD8 T-cell-mediated demyelination was strongly dependent on the expression of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) by donor cells. In this report, we show, in contrast, that demyelination and lymphocyte infiltration were increased in recipients of IFN-γ(−/−) CD4 T cells when compared to levels in mice receiving C57BL/6 CD4 T cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
