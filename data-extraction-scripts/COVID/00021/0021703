Furthermore, it can activate kinases that phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which leads to inhibition of (viral) protein translation and formation of stress granules (SG). Most viruses have evolved mechanisms to suppress these cellular responses. Here, we show that a mutant mengovirus expressing an inactive leader (L) protein, which we have previously shown to be unable to suppress IFN-α/β, triggered SG formation in a protein kinase R (PKR)-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that infection of cells that are defective in SG formation yielded higher viral RNA levels, suggesting that SG formation acts as an antiviral defense mechanism. Since the induction of both IFN-α/β and SG is suppressed by mengovirus L, we set out to investigate a potential link between these pathways. We observed that MDA5, the intracellular RNA sensor that recognizes picornaviruses, localized to SG. However, activation of the MDA5 signaling pathway did not trigger and was not required for SG formation. Moreover, cells that were unable to form SG—by protein kinase R (PKR) depletion, using cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable eIF2α protein, or by drug treatment that inhibits SG formation—displayed a normal IFN-α/β response. Thus, although MDA5 localizes to SG, this localization seems to be dispensable for induction of the IFN-α/β pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
