A total of 723 spots representing 574 protein entries were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, including the majority of known key virulence factors. 64 hypothetical proteins and six misannotated proteins were also experimentally identified. A comparison between the four proteome maps showed that most of the virulence-related proteins were up-regulated at 37 째C, and the differences were more notable in stationary phase cells, suggesting that the expressions of these virulence factors were not only controlled by temperature but also controlled by the nutrients available in the environment. The expression patterns of some virulence-related genes under the four different conditions suggested that they might also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. A further significant finding was that the expression of the protein ArgT was dramatically up-regulated at 30 째C. The results of semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of argT was not regulated at the transcriptional level. Therefore, we carried out a series of experiments to uncover the mechanism regulating ArgT levels and found that the differential expression of ArgT was due to its degradation by a periplasmic protease, HtrA, whose activity, but not its synthesis, was affected by temperature. The cleavage site in ArgT was between position 160 (Val) and position 161 (Ala). These results may provide useful insights for understanding the physiology and pathogenesis of S. flexneri.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
