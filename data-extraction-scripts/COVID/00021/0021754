Their in vitro efficiencies were investigated in HepG2.2.15 cells stably transfected with HBV. β-l-2′,3′-Didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (β-l-Hyd4C) was most effective in reducing secreted HBV DNA (50% effective concentration [EC(50)], 0.03 μM), followed by β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thia-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.51 μM), β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.55 μM), and β-l-5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine (EC(50), 0.9 μM). The inhibition of the presumed target, the HBV DNA polymerase, by the triphosphates of some of the β-l-cytidine derivatives was also assessed. In accordance with the cell culture data, β-l-Hyd4C triphosphate was the most active inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.21 μM. The cytotoxicities of some of the 4-NHOH-modified β-l-nucleosides were dramatically lower than those of the corresponding cytidine analogues with the unmodified 4-NH(2) group. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations for β-l-Hyd4C in HepG2 and HL-60 cells were 2,500 μM and 3,500 μM, respectively. In summary, our results demonstrate that at least β-l-Hyd4C can be recommended as a highly efficient and extremely selective inhibitor of HBV replication for further investigations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
