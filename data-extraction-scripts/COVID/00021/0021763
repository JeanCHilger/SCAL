In addition to providing an overview of the process, recent advances in our understanding of the role of the factor eIF5A in both translation elongation and termination is discussed. We also highlight mechanisms of translation recoding with a focus on ribosomal frameshifting during elongation. We see that the balance between the basic steps in elongation and the less common recoding events is determined by the kinetics of the different processes as well as by specific sequence determinants.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
