<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Load and Acute Otitis Media Development after Human Metapneumovirus Upper Respiratory Tract Infection</TITLE><BODY>The role of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in acute otitis media (AOM) complicating upper respiratory tract infection (URI) was studied. Nasopharyngeal specimens from 700 URI episodes in 200 children were evaluated; 47 (7%) were positive for hMPV, 25 (3.6%) with hMPV as the only virus. Overall, 24% of URI episodes with hMPV only were complicated by AOM, which was the lowest rate compared with other respiratory viruses. hMPV viral load was significantly higher in children with fever, but there was no difference in viral load in children with hMPV positive URI with or without AOM complication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
