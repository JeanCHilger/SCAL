This study shows that the antibody levels against these self-proteins are higher in sera from patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) than those in control sera. Anti–protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and anti–heat shock protein 60 (anti-HSP60) IgM levels correlated with both anti–endothelial cells and anti-DENV NS1 IgM titers. A cross-reactive epitope on the NS1 amino acid residues 311–330 (P311–330) had been predicted. We further found that there were higher IgM and IgG levels against P311–330 in DHF patients' sera than those in the control sera. In addition, correlations were observed between anti-PDI with anti-P311–330 IgM and IgG levels, respectively. Therefore, our results indicate that DENV NS1 P311–330 is a major epitope for cross-reactive antibodies to PDI on the endothelial cell surface, which may play an important role in DENV infection–induced autoimmunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
