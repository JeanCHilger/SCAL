Rotavirus likely represses the IFN response by at least 4 mechanisms. First, the rotavirus protein NSP1, most likely functioning as an E3 ligase, can induce proteasome-dependent degradation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 to prevent their induction of IFN. Second, NSP1 can induce proteasome-dependent degradation of the ubiquitin ligase complex protein β-TrCP, resulting in stabilization of IκB and concomitant failure of virus to activate NF-κB for induction of IFN. Third, rotavirus may sequester NF-κB in viroplasms. And fourth, rotavirus can prevent STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation. The predominant mechanism for rotavirus inhibition of the IFN response is likely both rotavirus strain-specific and cell type-specific. The mammalian reoviruses also display strain-specific differences in their modulation of the IFN response. Reovirus activates RIG-I and IPS-1 for phosphorylation of IRF3. Reovirus-induced activation of MDA5 also participates in induction if IFN-β, perhaps through activation of NF-κB. Reovirus likely inhibits the IFN response by at least 3 virus strain-specific mechanisms. First, the reovirus μ2 protein can induce an unusual nuclear accumulation of IRF9 and repress IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, most likely by disrupting IRF9 function as part of the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex, ISGF3. Second, the reovirus σ3 protein can bind dsRNA and prevent activation of the latent antiviral effector protein PKR. And third, genetic approaches have identified the reovirus λ2 and σ2 proteins in virus strain-specific modulation of the IFN response, but the significance remains unclear. In sum, members of the family Reoviridae have evolved a variety of mechanisms to subvert the host's innate protective response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
