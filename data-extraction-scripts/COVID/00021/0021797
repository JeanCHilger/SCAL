Coexpression of the SCoV S, M, E, and 6 proteins was sufficient for incorporation of the 6 protein into virus-like particles. Cells transfected with plasmid expressing the 6 protein released SCoV 6 protein; however, infected cells released SCoV 6 protein only in association with SCoV particles.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
