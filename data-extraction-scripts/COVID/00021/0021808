Recent studies have demonstrated that AnxA2 also functions in immunity against infection, but the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Using a mouse infection model, we now reveal a crucial role of AnxA2 in host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), as anxa2(−/−) mice manifested severe lung injury, systemic dissemination, and increased mortality compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. In addition, anxa2(−/−) mice exhibited elevated inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IFN-γ), decreased bacterial clearance by macrophages, and increased superoxide release in the lung. We further identified an unexpected molecular interaction between AnxA2 and Fam13A (Family with sequence similarity 13, member A), which activated Rho GTPase. P. aeruginosa infection induced autophagosome formation by inhibiting Akt1 and mTOR. Our results indicate that AnxA2 regulates autophagy and thereby contributing to host immunity against bacteria through Akt1-mTOR-ULK1/2 signaling pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
