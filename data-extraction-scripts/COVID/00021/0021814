The importance of receptor recognition in target cell selection by reovirus implicates the σ1 protein as the primary effector of disease outcome. However, the contribution of σ1s to reovirus disease is unknown. To define the function of σ1s in reovirus pathogenesis, we generated a σ1s-deficient virus by altering a single nucleotide to disrupt the σ1s translational start site. Viruses were recovered that contain nine gene segments from strain type 3 Dearing and either the wild-type or σ1s-null S1 gene segment from strain type 1 Lang. Following peroral inoculation of newborn mice, both viruses replicated in the intestine, although the wild-type virus achieved higher yields than the σ1s-null virus. However, unlike the wild-type virus, the σ1s-deficient virus failed to disseminate to sites of secondary viral replication, including the brain, heart, and liver. Within the small intestine, both viruses were detected in Peyer's patches, but only the wild-type virus reached the mesenteric lymph node. Concordantly, wild-type virus, but not σ1s-deficient virus, was detected in the blood of infected animals. Wild-type and σ1s-null viruses produced equivalent titers following intracranial inoculation, indicating that σ1s is dispensable for viral growth in the murine CNS. These results suggest a key role for σ1s in virus spread from intestinal lymphatics to the bloodstream, thereby allowing the establishment of viremia and dissemination to sites of secondary replication within the infected host.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
