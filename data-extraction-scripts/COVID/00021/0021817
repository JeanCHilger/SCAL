Here, we confirm that ORF35-37 is functionally dicistronic during infection and demonstrate that mutation of the dominant uORF restricts KSHV replication. Leaky scanning past the uORFs facilitates ORF35 expression, while a reinitiation mechanism after translation of the uORFs enables ORF36 expression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
