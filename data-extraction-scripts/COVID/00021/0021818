<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-08-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete Genome Sequence of a Novel Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in South China</TITLE><BODY>Since early 2010, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have been observed frequently in immunized swine herds in southern China. The suckling piglets are particularly susceptible to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), with a high mortality rate (90%). Recently, a virulent PEDV strain, GD-A, was isolated from an immunized-swine breeding farm in Guangdong, China. This report describes the complete genome sequence of GD-A, and the data will provide important insights into the variation of PEDV field isolates in southern China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
