It is not known whether these cells are maintained by proliferation of T cells that entered the CNS during acute infection or are newly recruited from antigen-experienced or naïve T cell pools. Here, using adoptive transfer experiments and bone marrow chimeras, we show that at least some of these cells are recruited from the periphery, predominantly from the viral antigen-experienced T cell pool. Both virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are functional, as assessed by cytokine expression and degranulation after peptide exposure. In addition, populations of virus-specific CD4 T cells undergo dynamic changes in the infected CNS, as previously shown for CD8 T cells, since ratios of cells responding to two CD4 T cell epitopes change by a factor of 5 during the course of persistence. Collectively, these results show that maintenance of T cell responses in the virus-infected CNS is a dynamic process. Further, virus-specific T cell numbers at this site of infection are maintained by recruitment from peripheral antigen-experienced and naïve T cell pools.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
