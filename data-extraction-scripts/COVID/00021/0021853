<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-09-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Parainfluenza Virus 4 Outbreak and the Role of Diagnostic Tests</TITLE><BODY>Owing to the difficulties in isolating the virus and the lack of routine surveillance, the clinical significance of human parainfluenza virus 4 (HPIV-4) is less well defined than that of the other human parainfluenza viruses. We describe the first outbreak of HPIV-4 infection in a developmental disabilities unit, involving 38 institutionalized children and three staff members, during a 3-week period in autumn 2004. Most subjects had upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), while lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) occurred in three children (7%), one complicated by respiratory failure requiring ventilation support. All patients recovered. Nasopharyngeal aspirates tested for HPIV-4 were positive by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in all 41 cases (100%), by direct immunofluorescence in 29 of 39 tested cases (74%), and by cell cultures in 6 of 37 cases (16%), and serum was positive for antibodies against HPIV-4 in all 35 cases (100%) with serum samples available. In addition, RT-PCR detected HPIV-4 in four children (three LRTI and one URTI) out of 115 patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infection. Molecular analysis of the 1,198-bp phosphoprotein sequences showed that HPIV-4 isolates among the cases were genetically similar, whereas the community controls were more genetically distant, supporting nosocomial transmission of a single HPIV-4 genotype during the outbreak. Moreover, the HPIV-4 causing the outbreak is more closely related to HPIV-4A than HPIV-4B. HPIV-4 may be an important cause of more severe respiratory illness in children. The present RT-PCR assay is a sensitive, specific, and rapid method for the diagnosing HPIV-4 infection. To better define the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease of HPIV-4 infections, HPIV-4 should be included in the routine panels of respiratory virus detection on respiratory specimens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
