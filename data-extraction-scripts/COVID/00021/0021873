Individual serum samples from 60 dairy cattle herds located in Pennsylvania were evaluated by the microplate virus isolation method, and pooled sera were analyzed by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was sensitive and specific and detected a single viremic serum sample in up to 100 pooled serum samples. RT-PCR analysis of pooled sera provides a rapid and cost-effective method for the screening of cattle herds for the presence of animals persistently infected with BVDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
