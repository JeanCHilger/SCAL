<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-01-25</DATELINE><TITLE>An Antibody Recognizing the Apical Domain of Human Transferrin Receptor 1 Efficiently Inhibits the Entry of All New World Hemorrhagic Fever Arenaviruses</TITLE><BODY>Five New World (NW) arenaviruses cause human hemorrhagic fevers. Four of these arenaviruses are known to enter cells by binding human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1). Here we show that the fifth arenavirus, Chapare virus, similarly uses hTfR1. We also identify an anti-hTfR1 antibody, ch128.1, which efficiently inhibits entry mediated by the glycoproteins of all five viruses, as well as replication of infectious Jun√≠n virus. Our data indicate that all NW hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses utilize a common hTfR1 apical-domain epitope and suggest that therapeutic agents targeting this epitope, including ch128.1 itself, can be broadly effective in treating South American hemorrhagic fevers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
