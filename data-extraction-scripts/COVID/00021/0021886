<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-10-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Assays for the Identification of Novel Antivirals against Bluetongue Virus</TITLE><BODY>To identify potential antivirals against BTV, we have developed, optimized and validated three assays presented here. The CPE-based assay was the first assay developed to evaluate whether a compound showed any antiviral efficacy and have been used to screen large compound library. Meanwhile, cytotoxicity of antivirals could also be evaluated using the CPE-based assay. The dose-response assay was designed to determine the range of efficacy for the selected antiviral, i.e. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) or effective concentration (EC(50)), as well as its range of cytotoxicity (CC(50)). The ToA assay was employed for the initial MoA study to determine the underlying mechanism of the novel antivirals during BTV viral lifecycle or the possible effect on host cellular machinery. These assays are vital for the evaluation of antiviral efficacy in cell culture system, and have been used for our recent researches leading to the identification of a number of novel antivirals against BTV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
