Using as a template the crystal structure of a distantly related bacterial leucine transporter, we have generated 3-D DAT computer molecular models. Ligand docking to such models has revealed potential substrate and inhibitor binding pockets, subsequently confirmed by in vitro pharmacology. An inhibitor pocket defined by the DAT model to be within the “extracellular vestibule”, just to the extracellular side of the external gate of the primary substrate pocket, was used for virtual screening of a structural library of compounds. High-throughput docking and application of pharmacophore constraints within this vestibular inhibitor pocket identified a compound structurally dissimilar to the classic monoamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) transporter (MAT) inhibitors. The compound displaced binding of radiolabeled cocaine analogs at all three MATs, usually with nanomolar K(i) values and within 2-fold of cocaine’s affinity at the norepinephrine transporter. Although a very weak dopamine uptake inhibitor itself, this compound reduced by 3-fold the potency of cocaine in inhibiting DAT-mediated cellular uptake of dopamine. To our knowledge, the present findings are the first to successfully employ “receptor-based” computer modeling to identify moderate- to high-affinity MAT ligands. In silico ligand screening using MAT models provides a rapid, low-cost discovery process that should accelerate identification of novel ligand scaffolds and provide lead compounds in combating psychostimulant addiction and in treating other monoamine-related CNS diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
