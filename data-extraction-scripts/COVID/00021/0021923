Electrophilic glycosidation between 16 and the silylated nucleobases (N(4)-acetylcytosine, N(6)-benzoyladenine, and N(2)-acetyl-O(6)-diphenylcarbamoylguanine) was carried out in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide (NIS), leading to the exclusive formation of the desired β-anomers 29, 33, and 36. Anti-HIV studies demonstrated that these 4′-thio nucleosides were less cytotoxic to T-lymphocyte (i.e., MT-4 cells) than the corresponding 4′-ethynyl derivatives of 2′-deoxycytidine (44), 2′-deoxyadenosine (45), and 2′-deoxyguanosine (46). Comparison of the selectivity indices (SI) was made between 4′-thionucleosides (32, 41, and 43) and the corresponding 4′-oxygen analogues 44-46 by using the reported CC(50) and EC(50) values. In the case of cytosine and adenine nucleosides, comparable SI values were obtained as follows: 32 (545) and 44 (458); 41 (>230) and 45 (1630). In contrast, 4′-ethynyl-2′-deoxy-4′-thioguanosine 43 was found to possess a SI value of >18200, which is 20 times better than that of 46 (933).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
