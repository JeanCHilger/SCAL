PABPC is predominantly cytoplasmic at steady state, where it enhances protein synthesis through simultaneous interactions with mRNA and translation factors. However, it accumulates dramatically within the nucleus in response to various pathogenic and nonpathogenic stresses, leading to an inhibition of mRNA export. The molecular events that trigger relocalization of PABPC and the mechanisms by which it translocates into the nucleus to block gene expression are not understood. Here, we reveal an RNA-based mechanism of retaining PABPC in the cytoplasm. Expression either of viral proteins that promote mRNA turnover or of a cytoplasmic deadenylase drives nuclear relocalization of PABPC in a manner dependent on the PABPC RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Using multiple independent binding sites within its RRMs, PABPC interacts with importin α, a component of the classical import pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that the direct association of PABPC with importin α is antagonized by the presence of poly(A) RNA, supporting a model in which RNA binding masks nuclear import signals within the PABPC RRMs, thereby ensuring efficient cytoplasmic retention of this protein in normal cells. These findings further suggest that cells must carefully calibrate the ratio of PABPC to mRNA, as events that offset this balance can dramatically influence gene expression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
