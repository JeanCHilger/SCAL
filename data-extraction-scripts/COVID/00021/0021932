The tripartite motif protein TRIM5α has emerged as an important mediator of species-specific retroviral replication and innate immunity. This review considers the role of TRIM5α as an antiviral protein in mammals. The methods used to identify species-specific restriction to retroviral infection, and the identification of TRIM5α itself, are outlined. TRIM5α mediates an early postentry block to sensitive retroviral infection, usually before viral DNA synthesis. Results from mutational analysis of TRIM5α and their contribution to a mechanistic model for TRIM5α antiviral activity are discussed. The antiviral role of other TRIM proteins is considered, as is the role of TRIM5α cytoplasmic bodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
