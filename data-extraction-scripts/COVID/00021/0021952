<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Characteristic of Dengue Disease in Taiwan: 2002–2007</TITLE><BODY>Taiwan's dengue outbreaks have a unique type of transmission: starting by import from abroad in early summer, spreading out locally, and ending in the winter. This pattern repeats every year. Most of the dengue patients are adults, with dengue fever peaking in the 50–54 year age range, and dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 60–64 year age range. Two patterns of dengue infection were found: DENV-2 in 2002 with 74% of secondary infection in contrast to non-DENV-2 (DENV-1 or DENV-3) in 2004–2007 with ~70% of primary infection. Secondary dengue virus infection increases disease morbidity, but not mortality in adults. The active serological surveillance shows two-thirds of the dengue-infected adults are symptomatic post infection. The Taiwanese experience of adult dengue should be valuable for countries or areas where, although dengue is not endemic, the Aedes aegypti vector exists and dengue virus can be introduced by travelers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
