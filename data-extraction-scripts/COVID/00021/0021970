<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-10-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Innate receptors and cellular defense against pulmonary infections</TITLE><BODY>In the United States, mortality as a result of lung infections consistently ranks in the top ten leading causes of death, accounting for over 50,000 deaths annually. Moreover, there are more than 140,000 deaths annually as a result of chronic lung diseases, some of which may be complicated by an infectious process. The lung is constantly exposed to the environment and consequently, susceptible to infectious complications caused by bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic pathogens. Indeed, we are continually faced with the threat of morbidity and mortality associated with annual influenza virus infections, new respiratory viruses (such as SARS-CoV) as well as lung infections caused by antibiotic-resistant “ESKAPE pathogens” (three of which target the lung). This review will highlight innate immune receptors and cell types that function to protect against infectious challenges to the respiratory system yet may also be associated with exacerbations in chronic lung diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
