We identified a bi-planar dicarboxylic acid compound, called SCF-I2, as an inhibitor of substrate phosphodegron recognition by the yeast F-box protein Cdc4. SCF-I2 inhibits the binding and ubiquitination of full length phosphorylated substrates by SCF(Cdc4). A crystal co-structure reveals that SCF-I2 inserts between the β-strands of blades 5 and 6 of the WD40 propeller domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 Å remote from the substrate binding site. Long-range transmission of SCF-I2 interactions distorts the substrate binding pocket and impedes recognition of key determinants in the Cdc4 phosphodegron. Mutation of the SCF-I2 binding site abrogates its inhibitory effect and explains specificity in the allosteric inhibition mechanism. Mammalian WD40 domain proteins may exhibit similar allosteric responsiveness and hence represent an extensive new class of druggable target.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
