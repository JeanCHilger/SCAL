Furthermore, ferrets are the preferred preclinical model for influenza vaccine and therapeutic testing. Here we characterized the influenza infectome during the different stages of the infectious process in ferrets with and without prior specific immunity to influenza. RNA from lung tissue and lymph nodes from infected and na√Øve animals was subjected to next-generation sequencing, followed by de novo data assembly and annotation of the resulting sequences; this process generated a library comprising 13,202 ferret mRNAs. Gene expression profiles during pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) influenza virus infection were analyzed by digital gene expression and solid support microarrays. As expected during primary infection, innate immune responses were triggered in the lung tissue; meanwhile, in the lymphoid tissue, genes encoding antigen presentation and maturation of effector cells of adaptive immunity increased dramatically. After 5 days postinfection, the innate immune gene expression was replaced by the adaptive immune response, which correlates with viral clearance. Reinfection with homologous pandemic influenza virus resulted in a diminished innate immune response, early adaptive immune gene regulation, and a reduction in clinical severity. The fully annotated ferret infectome will be a critical aid to the understanding of the molecular events that regulate disease severity and host-influenza virus interactions among seasonal, pandemic, and highly pathogenic avian influenzas.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
