A yeast two-hybrid screen identified the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 as a protein interacting with RAP80. The interaction of RAP80 with UBC9 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses. The region between a.a. 122â€“204 was critical for the interaction of RAP80 with UBC9. In addition, we demonstrate that RAP80 is a target for SUMO-1 modification in intact cells. Expression of UBC9 enhanced RAP80 mono-sumoylation and also induced multisumoylation of RAP80. In addition to SUMO-1, RAP80 was efficiently conjugated to SUMO-3 but was only a weak substrate for SUMO-2 conjugation. These findings suggest that sumoylation plays a role in the regulation of RAP80 functions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
