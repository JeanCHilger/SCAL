Antibiotics affect microbiota and impair immune response against RVIs in mice, and low microbiome diversity is associated with pulmonary complications including viral lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. In this study, we examined whether antibiotic exposure was associated with increased risk of disease progression in RVIs post-transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed patients who underwent allogeneic HCT (6/2008-2/2016) and had their first RVI due to parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human metapneumovirus (MPV) during the initial 100 days post-transplantation. Antibiotic exposure in the three weeks before RVI onset was defined as (i) use of specific antibiotics versus none of these antibiotics, and (ii) number of antibiotic-days. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between antibiotic exposures and risk of viral disease progression to proven/probable/possible LRTD. RESULTS: Ninety HCT recipients (84 adults, 6 children) fulfilled study criteria; 33 progressed to LRTD. The number of antibiotic-days was associated with progression to LRTD after adjusting for neutropenia, steroid use, and either lymphopenia (hazard ratio, 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.92], P=.027) or monocytopenia (hazard ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.11–1.91], P=.006). Specific antibiotic classes was not associated with the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative antibiotic exposure immediately before RVI onset is a risk factor for disease progression following PIV, RSV and MPV infections post-transplantation. Larger cohort studies are needed to determine the impact of specific antibiotics/antibiotic classes on disease severity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
