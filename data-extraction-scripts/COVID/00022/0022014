Sevoflurane, a commonly used anesthetic in children, has been reported to decrease levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). However, the up-stream mechanisms and down-stream consequences of the sevoflurane-induced reduction in PSD-95 levels remains largely unknown. We therefore set out to assess whether sevoflurane acts on ubiquitination-proteasome pathway to facilitate PSD-95 degradation. METHODS: Six-day-old wild-type mice received anesthesia with 3% sevoflurane 2 hours daily for 3 days starting on postnatal (P) day 6. We determined effects of the sevoflurane anesthesia on mRNA, protein and ubiquitinated levels of PSD-95 in neurons, synaptosomes and hippocampus of young mice. Cognitive function in the mice was determined at P31 by using Morris Water Maze. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 and E3 ligase mouse double mutant 2 homolog inhibitor Nutlin-3 were used for the interaction studies. RESULTS: The sevoflurane anesthesia decreased protein, but not mRNA, levels of PSD-95, and reduced ubiquitinated PSD-95 levels in neurons, synaptosomes, and hippocampus of young mice. Both MG132 and Nutlin-3 blocked these sevoflurane-induced effects. Sevoflurane promoted the interaction of mouse double mutant 2 homolog and PSD-95 in neurons. Finally, MG132 and Nutlin-3 ameliorated the sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in the mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that sevoflurane acts on the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway to facilitate PSD-95 degradation, which then decreases PSD-95 levels, leading to cognitive impairment in young mice. These studies would further promote the mechanistic investigation of anesthesia neurotoxicity in the developing brain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
