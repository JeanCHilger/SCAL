Bruyere, M. Wantroba, S. Flasinski, A. Dzianott, and J. J. Bujarski, J. Virol. 74:4214-4219, 2000). To further our knowledge about mechanisms of viral RNA genome variability, in this paper we have studied homologous recombination in BMV RNA1 and RNA2 components during infection. We have found that basal RNA-RNA crossovers could occur within coding regions of both RNAs, although recombination frequencies slightly varied at different RNA sections. In all cases, the frequencies were much lower than the rate observed for the intercistronic recombination hot spot in BMV RNA3. Probability calculations accounted for at least one homologous crossover per RNA molecule per replication cycle. In addition, we have demonstrated an efficient repair of mutations within the conserved 3′ and 5′ noncoding regions, most likely due to error-prone BMV RNA replication. Overall, our data verify that homologous crossovers are common events a during virus life cycle, and we discuss their importance for viral RNA genetics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
