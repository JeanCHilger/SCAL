However, a mouse erythroleukemia cell line, CB3, does not express hnRNP A1 but still supports MHV replication, suggesting that alternative proteins can replace hnRNP A1 in cellular functions and viral infection. In this study, we set out to identify these proteins. UV cross-linking experiments revealed that several CB3 cellular proteins similar in size to hnRNP A1 interacted with the MHV RNA. These proteins were purified by RNA affinity column with biotinylated negative-strand MHV leader RNA and identified by mass spectrometry to be hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP A/B, and hnRNP A3, all of which belong to the type A/B hnRNPs. All of these proteins contain amino acid sequences with strong similarity to the RNA-binding domains of hnRNP A1. Some of these hnRNPs have previously been shown to replace hnRNP A1 in regulating RNA splicing. These proteins displayed MHV RNA-binding affinity and specificity similar to those of hnRNP A1. hnRNP A2/B1, which is predominantly localized to the nucleus and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, was shown to relocalize to the cytoplasm in MHV-infected CB3 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of hnRNP A/B in cells enhanced MHV RNA synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that the functions of hnRNP A1 in MHV RNA synthesis can be replaced by other closely related hnRNPs, further supporting the roles of cellular proteins in MHV RNA synthesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
