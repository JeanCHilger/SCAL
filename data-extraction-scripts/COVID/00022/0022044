They also serve as signals for protein folding, trafficking, and degradation in protein quality control. A number of lectins and antibodies recognize high-mannose-type N-glycans, and glycan array technology has provided an avenue to probe these oligomannose-specific proteins. We describe in this paper a top-down chemoenzymatic approach to synthesize a library of high-mannose N-glycans and related neoglycoproteins for glycan microarray analysis. The method involves the sequential enzymatic trimming of two readily available natural N-glycans, the Man(9)GlcNAc(2)Asn prepared from soybean flour and the sialoglycopeptide (SGP) isolated from chicken egg yolks, coupled with chromatographic separation to obtain a collection of a full range of natural high-mannose N-glycans. The Asn-linked N-glycans were conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to provide neoglycoproteins containing the oligomannose moieties. The glycoepitopes displayed were characterized using an array of glycan-binding proteins, including the broadly virus-neutralizing agents, glycan-specific antibody 2G12, Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA), and Narcissus pseudonarcissus lectin (NPA).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
