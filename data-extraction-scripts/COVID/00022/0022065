<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-14</DATELINE><TITLE>The Superimposed Deubiquitination Effect of OTULIN and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) Nsp11 Promotes Multiplication of PRRSV</TITLE><BODY>Linear ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response by regulating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). The linear ubiquitination-specific deubiquitinase ovarian tumor domain deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN) can control the immune signaling transduction pathway by restricting the Met1-linked ubiquitination process. In our study, the porcine OTLLIN gene was cloned and deubiquitin functions were detected in a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected-cell model. PRRSV infection promotes the expression of the OTULIN gene; in turn, overexpression of OTULIN contributes to PRRSV proliferation. There is negative regulation of innate immunity with OTULIN during viral infection. The cooperative effects of swine OTULIN and PRRSV Nsp11 potentiate the ability to reduce levels of cellular protein ubiquitin associated with innate immunity. Importantly, PRRSV Nsp11 recruits OTULIN through a nonenzymatic combination to enhance its ability to remove linear ubiquitination targeting NEMO, resulting in a superimposed effect that inhibits the production of type I interferons (IFNs). Our report presents a new model of virus utilization of the ubiquitin-protease system in vivo from the perspective of the viral proteins that interact with cell deubiquitination enzymes, providing new ideas for prevention and control of PRRSV. IMPORTANCE Deubiquitination effects of swine OTULIN were identified. The interaction between porcine OTULIN and PRRSV Nsp11 is dependent on the OTU domain. PRRSV Nsp11 recruits OTULIN through a nonenzymatic combination to promote removal of linear ubiquitination targeting NEMO, resulting in a superimposed effect that inhibits the production of type I IFNs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
