METHODS: The apoptosis of duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) induced by NGVEV was investigated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and fluorescence microscope after the cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). RESULTS: By staining cells with a combination of fluorescein annexin V-FITC and PI, it is possible to distinguish and quantitatively analyze non-apoptotic cells (Annexin V-FITC negative/PI negative), early apoptotic cells (Annexin V-FITC positive/PI negative), late apoptotic/necrotic cells (Annexin V-FITC positive/PI positive) and dead cells (Annexin V-FITC negative/PI positive) through flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with the incubation time and reached a maximum at 120 h after infection, while the percentage of non-apoptotic cells decreased. CONCLUSION: NGVEV can induce the infected DEF cells to undergo apoptosis and the apoptosis occurs prior to necrosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
