MxA polymorphism (rs2071430) is located within an Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) at position −88 in the gene’s promoter region, and it has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections and various diseases. In general, the low promoter activity genotype (GG) promotes susceptibility, whereas the high promoter activity genotype (TT) confers protection to Hepatitis C viral infection. MxA’s role in prostate cancer is not fully understood. Previous literature has shown that MxA may be a mediator of the effect of IFN on normal and tumor cell motility. MxA may act as a tumor suppressor and the level of expression may be a predictor of metastatic potential. Based on this information, in this study we investigated the association of this functional polymorphism (rs2071430) in MxA with prostate cancer. METHODS: Sample size and power was calculated using the PGA software. Genomic DNA from a controls (n=140) and prostate cancer patients (n=164) were used for genotyping SNP rs2071430 on all samples. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: A significant association was observed between rs2071430 genotype GG and prostate cancer. Individuals harboring the GG genotype are at an increased risk of prostate cancer. Data stratification reveals that the mutant GT genotype offers either offers some protection against prostate cancer in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: MxA SNP rs2071430 GG genotype is significantly associated with prostate cancer irrespective of race. However, data stratification also suggests that the GT genotype is under-represented in Caucasian subjects suggesting its role in protection against prostate cancer in Caucasians. Although MxA is primarily implicated in viral infection, but it may be also be associated with prostate cancer. Recent studies have implicated viral and bacterial infections with increased prostate cancer risk. Expression of the high promoter activity genotype may offer resistance to prostate cancer infection and possibly influence clinical outcomes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
