Virus isolation and neutralization tests are usually done to identify the causative virus, but these tests are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and standardized antisera are in limited supply. This study investigated a rapid and reliable method of virus identification based on PCR and phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree constructed by neighbor joining on the basis of the newly determined partial hexon sequences from 33 prototypes of HAdV-D and -E, along with 11 available prototypes of HAdV-A to -C and -F from GenBank, allowed HAdVs to be grouped into six distinct clusters. These clusters correspond closely to the six newly designated species, HAdV-A to -F. The partial hexon sequences of 57 isolates from patients with acute conjunctivitis obtained over 20 years plus those of 44 prototype strains were analyzed. Each isolate formed a monophyletic cluster along with its respective prototype strain, allowing serotype identification. Partial-hexon-based classification appears to be an effective tool for studying the molecular epidemiology of HAdVs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
