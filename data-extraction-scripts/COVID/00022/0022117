<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Delivery strategies for novel vaccine formulations</TITLE><BODY>A major challenge in vaccine design is to identify antigen presentation and delivery systems capable of rapidly stimulating both the humoral and cellular components of the immune system to elicit a strong and sustained immunity against different viral isolates. Approaches to achieve this end involve live attenuated and inactivated virions, viral vectors, DNA, and protein subunits. This review reports the state of current antigen delivery, and focuses on two innovative systems recently established at our labs. These systems are the filamentous bacteriophage fd and an icosahedral scaffold formed by the acyltransferase component (E2 protein) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of Bacillus stearothermophilus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
