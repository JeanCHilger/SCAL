Mice displayed altered growth plates, diminished trabecular bone, and marrow hypoplasia with an aberrant lymphocyte profile throughout life. This study identifies altered B220(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) lymphocyte numbers, as well as CD4(+)/fox3P(+) T regulatory cells in the collagen X mice. Additionally, diminished in vitro splenocyte responses to mitogens and an inability of mice to survive a challenge with Toxoplasma gondii, confirm impaired immune responses. In concert, ELISA and protein arrays identify aberrant levels of inflammatory, chemo-attractant, and matrix binding cytokines in collagen X mouse sera. These data link the disruption of collagen X function in the chondro-osseous junction to an altered hematopoietic stem cell niche in the marrow, resulting in impaired immune function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
