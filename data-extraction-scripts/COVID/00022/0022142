The test's overall sensitivity was 43.83%, lower than previously reported but similar for detection of both influenza A and B viruses (42.98 versus 44.76%). However, specificity, 99.74%, was excellent for both influenza A and B viruses (99.82 versus 99.92%). These values make this test a very good confirmatory test when clinical suspicion is high, but a less accurate screening test for large populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
