Here we demonstrate that changes in frameshifting and virus maintenance in these mutants correlates with decreased peptidyltransferase activities. The mutants did not affect Ty1-directed programmed +1 ribosomal frameshifting or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Independent experiments demonstrate similar programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting specific defects in cells lacking ribosomal protein L41, which has previously been shown to result in peptidyltransferase defects in yeast. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that decreased peptidyltransferase activity should result in longer ribosome pause times after the accommodation step of the elongation cycle, allowing more time for ribosomal slippage at programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
