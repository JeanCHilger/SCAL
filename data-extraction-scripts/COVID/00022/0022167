Although necessary to control infection, immune responses can lead to severe CNS pathology in the context of both viral infection and autoimmunity. Research into how the central nervous and immune systems communicate has accelerated over the past 20 years leading to a better understanding of pathways controlling immune activation and neuroinflammation that have guided the approval of new disease-modifying therapies to treat CNS immunopathology, particularly the inflammatory demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. This article provides an introduction into the basic principles underlying immune responses within the CNS that developed from experimental animal models of both neurotropic virus infection and autoimmune T cell mediated CNS demyelination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
