Although enzymatic activity from immobilized proteins has been reliably studied using surface plasmon resonance, a microarray of catalytically competent enzymes would facilitate high throughput, parallel study of their function. The ability to localize activity from soluble substrates has frustrated development of such an array. Here, we report the novel use of previously developed, highly specific suicide substrates for three families of enzymes: deubiquitylases, deSUMOylases, and deISGylases. We show specificity of each family to its cognate substrate, and demonstrate utility of the array in a secondary screen of small molecule inhibitors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
