STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University of Washington Sleep Center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a cohort of newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea patients (N = 233), we obtained scores for the Functional Comorbidity Index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and SF-36. We calculated Spearman correlations and adjusted coefficients of determination (R(2)) with multiple linear regression, adjusted for demographic and health covariates. Bootstrapping generated R(2) distributions for statistical comparison. RESULTS: Functional Comorbidity Index scores (mean±standard deviation 2.4±1.7) were more widely distributed than Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (0.7±1.4). The Functional Comorbidity Index was significantly correlated with SF-36 Physical Function (−0.53, p<0.001), Physical Component Score (−0.44, p<0.001), and Mental Component Score (−0.38, p<0.001). The Functional Comorbidity Index was a better predictor than the Charlson Comorbidity Index of SF-36 Physical Function (R(2) mean±standard error 0.27±0.05 versus 0.17±0.05, p<0.001), Physical Component Score (0.23±0.05 versus 0.17±0.05, p<0.001), and Mental Component Score (0.23±0.05 versus 0.13±0.05, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Functional Comorbidity Index is a more robust predictor of general health status than the Charlson Comorbidity Index in obstructive sleep apnea patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
