We present a case report of an immunocompromised patient suffering from pneumonia, for which the causative agent was not identified by routine methods. OBJECTIVES: To identify the potential cause of the pneumonia using a degenerate oligonucleotide primer (DOP) PCR assay which is designed to detect all viruses. STUDY DESIGN: DOP-PCR was applied to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from this patient. Generic PCR products were cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: The novel universal virus assay detected human metapneumovirus in the clinical sample. The finding was confirmed by two independent metapneumovirus specific PCRs targeting independent regions of the viral genome. CONCLUSIONS: The DOP PCR was used to detect and identify the sequence of an unidentified virus. This study provides proof of concept for the use on clinically relevant specimens of this unbiased universal assay, which requires no previous viral sequence information.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
