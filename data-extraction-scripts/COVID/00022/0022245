We estimate the serial interval of laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission in households. METHODS: Index cases were recruited after reporting to a primary healthcare center with symptoms. Members of their households were followed up with repeated home visits. RESULTS: Assuming a Weibull model and accounting for selection bias inherent in our field study design, we used symptom-onset times from 14 pairs of infector/infectee to estimate a mean serial interval of 3.6 days (95% confidence interval = 2.9â€“4.3 days), with standard deviation 1.6 days. CONCLUSION: The household serial interval of influenza may be longer than previously estimated. Studies of the complete serial interval, based on transmission in all community contexts, are a priority.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
