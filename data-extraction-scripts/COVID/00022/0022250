Objectives: To define the ontogeny and biology of the human small airway epithelium club cell. Methods: The small airway epithelium was sampled from the normal human lung by bronchoscopy and brushing. Single-cell transcriptome analysis and air–liquid interface culture were used to assess club cell ontogeny and biology. Measurements and Main Results: We identified the club cell population by unbiased clustering using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Principal component gradient analysis uncovered an ontologic link between KRT5 (keratin 5)(+) basal cells and SCGB1A1 (secretoglobin family 1A member 1)(+) club cells, a hypothesis verified by demonstrating in vitro that a pure population of human KRT5(+) SCGB1A1(−) small airway epithelial basal cells differentiate into SCGB1A1(+)KRT5(−) club cells on air–liquid interface culture. Using SCGB1A1 as the marker of club cells, the single-cell analysis identified novel roles for these cells in host defense, xenobiotic metabolism, antiprotease, physical barrier function, monogenic lung disorders, and receptors for human viruses. Conclusions: These observations provide novel insights into the molecular phenotype and biologic functions of the human club cell population and identify basal cells as the human progenitor cells for club cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
