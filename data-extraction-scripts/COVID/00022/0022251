The present study was carried out with the aim to develop anti-spike 1 (S1) subunit monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that could react with IBV strains of different genotypes. The high antigenicity region of S1 gene of an QX-like IBV strain Sczy3 was amplified and ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a(+), and the recombinant His-S1 fusion proteins were expressed and purified. The purified whole viral antigen of Sczy3 strain was used to immunize BALB/c mice to produce hybridoma-secreting anti-IBV MAbs. Eleven anti-IBV MAbs were generated, and two MAbs 1C8 and 2C10 were positive in indirect ELISA against both His-S1 protein and the purified whole viral antigen. These two MAbs showed positive reaction with IBV in Western blot, and the isotype were both IgM. These two MAbs react specifically with IBV but not with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9 or H5, and could cross-react with other 10 IBV strains in five different genotypes. End-point neutralizing assay performed in chicken embro kidney (CEK) cells revealed that the neutralization titer of 1C8 and 2C10 against Sczy3 reached 1:2.82 and 1:4.70, respectively. The anti-S1 MAbs produced in the present work may be valuable in developing an antigen-capture ELISA test for antigen detection or a competitive ELISA test for antibody detection or therapeutic medicine for IB in poultry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
