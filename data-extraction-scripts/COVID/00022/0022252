<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>New rules on international public health security</TITLE><BODY>A new set of rules on how WHO’s 193 Member States will handle disease outbreaks and other emergencies that could have international public health implications enter into force this month. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were revised in 2005 and have since been published in all six official United Nations’ languages. Now the onus is on countries to implement the regulations. But in order to do this, they need to build their own capacity to detect, assess, notify and report “events”, which may be a disease outbreak, a chemical spill or an unusually high number of deaths in a community. Countries also need to build capacity to respond to public health risks and emergencies of international concern within their borders, such as containing an outbreak. In this interview, Dr Guénaël Rodier, director of International Health Regulations Coordination, describes the challenges that Member States face as they prepare to take on their new responsibilities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
