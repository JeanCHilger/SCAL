The biological significance of this NS1 elongation remained elusive. We observed that replication kinetics of the wild-type virus A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) and a mutant encoding a truncated NS1 were indistinguishable in most experimental systems. However, wild-type virus outcompeted the mutant during mixed infections, suggesting that the NS1 extension conferred minor growth advantages.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
