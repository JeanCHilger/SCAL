The overall transcription profile of HBoV1 is similar to that of two other members of genus Bocavirus, minute virus of canines and bovine parvovirus 1. In particular, a spliced NS1-transcript that was not recognized previously expressed the large non-structural protein NS1 at approximately 100 kDa; and the NP1-encoding transcripts were expressed abundantly. In addition, the protein expression profile of human bocavirus type 2 (HBoV2) was examined in parallel by transfection of a nearly full-length clone in A549 cells, which is similar to that of HBoV1. Moreover, our results showed that, unlike human parvovirus B19 infection, expression of the HBoV1 proteins only does not induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A549 cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
