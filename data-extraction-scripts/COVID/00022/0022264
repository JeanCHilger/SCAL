<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-08-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Recent Advances in the Discovery of Norovirus Therapeutics: Miniperspective</TITLE><BODY>Noroviruses are members of the family Caliciviridae. Norovirus infections are a global health burden that impacts >20 million individuals annually in the U.S. alone. Noroviruses are associated with high morbidity among vulnerable populations, particularly immunocompromised patients. This perspective highlights recent developments related to the discovery and development of norovirus-specific small-molecule therapeutics as well as recent advances in our understanding of norovirus biology and pathogenesis. Most of the work in this area is at the early discovery stage and has been primarily focused on inhibitors of norovirus 3C-like protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase. However, recent discoveries emanating from basic studies in norovirus research have resulted in the identification of new host-related drug targets that can be exploited. A repurposed compound has been advanced to human clinical studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
