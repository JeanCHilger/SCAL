Both vaccines induced high rates of seroconversion (100%) and coproconversion (75–100%). The VLP+mLT vaccine induced Th1/Th2 serum cytokines and cytokine secreting cells, whereas the VLP+ISCOM vaccine induced Th2 biased responses with significantly elevated IgM, IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells in intestine. Nevertheless, both vaccines induced increased protection rates against viral shedding and diarrhea (75–100%) compared to controls; however, only 57% of controls shed virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
