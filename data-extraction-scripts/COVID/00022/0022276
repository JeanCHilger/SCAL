Natural WNV strain infections do not induce stress granules (SGs), while W956IC (a lineage 2/1 chimeric WNV infectious clone) virus infections produce high levels of early viral RNA and efficiently induce SGs through protein kinase R (PKR) activation. Additional WNV chimeric viruses made by replacing one or more W956IC genes with the lineage 1 Eg101 equivalent in the W956IC backbone were analyzed. The Eg-NS4b+5, Eg-NS1+3+4a, and Eg-NS1+4b+5 chimeras produced low levels of viral RNA at early times of infection and inefficiently induced SGs, suggesting the possibility that interactions between viral nonstructural proteins and/or between viral nonstructural proteins and cell proteins are involved in suppressing early viral RNA synthesis and membrane remodeling during natural WNV strain infections. Detection of exposed viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in W956IC-infected cells suggested that the enhanced early viral RNA synthesis surpassed the available virus-induced membrane protection and allowed viral dsRNA to activate PKR.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
