Recently, two nucleoplasmic proteins from mice were observed to bind to a model box C/D snoRNA in vitro, suggesting that they function at an early stage in snoRNP biogenesis. Both proteins have been described in other contexts. The proteins, called p50 and p55 in the snoRNA binding study, are highly conserved and related to each other. Both have Walker A and B motifs characteristic of ATP- and GTP-binding and nucleoside triphosphate-hydrolyzing domains, and the mammalian orthologs have DNA helicase activity in vitro. Here, we report that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of p50 (Rvb2, Tih2p, and other names) is required for production of C/D snoRNAs in vivo and, surprisingly, H/ACA snoRNAs as well. Point mutations in the Walker A and B motifs cause temperature-sensitive or lethal growth phenotypes and severe defects in snoRNA accumulation. Notably, depletion of p50 (called Rvb2 in this study) also impairs localization of C/D and H/ACA core snoRNP proteins Nop1p and Gar1p, suggesting a defect(s) in snoRNP assembly or trafficking to the nucleolus. Findings from other studies link Rvb2 orthologs with chromatin remodeling and transcription. Taken together, the present results indicate that Rvb2 is involved in an early stage of snoRNP biogenesis and may play a role in coupling snoRNA synthesis with snoRNP assembly and localization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
