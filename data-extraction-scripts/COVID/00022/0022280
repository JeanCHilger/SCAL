RT-PCR had a sensitivity for influenza A virus in stock virus preparations 10(3) times higher than virus isolation and 10(6) to 10(7) times higher than ELISA. The detection rate achieved by RT-PCR in clinical samples was clearly higher (93%) than that by virus isolation (80%) and ELISA (62%). Despite low overall detection rates achieved by antigen ELISA, samples from patients younger than 5 years old yielded higher-than-average rates in this rapid assay (88%). The likelihood of negative results in the ELISA increased significantly with increasing age of the patient (P < 0.01). The degrees of effectiveness of RT-PCR and virus isolation were not influenced by the age of the patient. Neither influenza immunizations nor the interval between onset of symptoms and laboratory investigation (mean, 4.7 days; standard deviation, 3.3 days) affected results obtained by the three test systems. Our results demonstrate that the ELISA is reliable for rapid laboratory diagnosis of influenza in infants and young children, but for older patients application of RT-PCR or virus isolation is necessary to avoid false negative results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
