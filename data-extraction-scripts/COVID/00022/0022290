OBJECTIVE: To estimate the attributable fraction (AF) and the detection rate attributable to illness for each of the different respiratory viruses STUDY DESIGN: We compared the prevalence of 10 common respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus 1–3; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enterovirus) in both HIV positive and negative patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI), and control subjects who did not report any febrile, respiratory or gastrointestinal illness during 2012–2015 in South Africa. RESULTS: We enrolled 1959 SARI, 3784 ILI and 1793 controls with a HIV sero-prevalence of 26%, 30% and 43%, respectively. Influenza virus (AF: 86.3%; 95%CI: 77.7–91.6%), hMPV (AF: 85.6%; 95%CI: 72.0–92.6%), and RSV (AF: 83.7%; 95%CI: 77.5–88.2%) infections were associated with severe disease., while rhinovirus (AF: 46.9%; 95%CI: 37.6–56.5%) and adenovirus (AF: 36.4%; 95%CI: 20.6–49.0%) were only moderately associated. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza, RSV and hMPV can be considered pathogens if detected in ILI and SARI while rhinovirus and adenovirus were commonly identified in controls suggesting that they may cause only a proportion of clinical disease observed in positive patients. Nonetheless, they may be important contributors to disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
