Unfortunately, to date no vaccine or antiviral against these pathogens is available. Here, using a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a 6-amino-acid hit peptide, LVLQTM, which acted as a pseudosubstrate of the viral 2A cysteine protease (2A(pro)) and inhibited its activity. This peptide was chemically modified with a reactive electrophilic fluoromethylketone group to form a covalent linkage with the nucleophilic active-site thiol of the enzyme. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments showed that thus converted, LVLQTM was a strong inhibitor of HRV replication in both A549 cells and mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report validating a compound against HRV infection in a mouse model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
