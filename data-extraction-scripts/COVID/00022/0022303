<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-10-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Development, Characterization, and Application of Monoclonal Antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein</TITLE><BODY>Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing coronavirus (CoV) were developed by hybridoma technology. Epitope mapping by Western blotting showed that these anti-SARS-CoV NP MAbs bind to distinct domains of NP. These anti-SARS-CoV NP MAbs, with their high specificity, are potentially ideal candidates for developing early and sensitive diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
