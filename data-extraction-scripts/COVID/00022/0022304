Here, an enhancer-like lncRNA termed NeST (Nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler’s; cleanup Salmonella not Theiler’s) is shown to be causal for all phenotypes conferred by murine viral susceptibility locus Tmevp3. This locus was defined by crosses between SJL/J and B10.S mice and contains several candidate genes, including NeST. The SJL/J-derived locus confers higher lncRNA expression, increased interferon-γ abundance in activated CD8(+) T cells, increased Theiler’s virus persistence and decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis. Transgenic expression of NeST lncRNA alone was sufficient to confer all phenotypes of the SJL/J locus. NeST RNA was found to bind WDR5, a component of the histone H3 lysine 4 methytransferase complex, and to alter histone 3 methylation at the interferon gamma locus. Thus, this lncRNA regulates epigenetic marking of IFNγ-encoding chromatin, expression of IFN-γ and susceptibility to a viral and a bacterial pathogen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
