Better data may lead to improved therapeutic and preventative strategies. The goal of our study was to determine the viral etiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infections in a rural Honduran population of children. METHODS: Prospective clinic surveillance was conducted to identify children <5 years of age presenting with respiratory symptoms <5 days duration. We obtained data on age, sex, medical history, breastfeeding history, symptoms, risk factors, house hold setting, temperature, respiratory rate, and chest exam findings. To assess the association between specific viruses and weather, regional meteorological data were collected. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using a multiplex PCR panel. RESULTS: From February 2010 through June 2011, 345 children <5 years of age were enrolled; 17%, 23%, 30%, and 31% were <6, 6–11, 12–23, and 24–60 months old, respectively. Including all clinics in the region, 44.5% of patients <5 years of age with documented respiratory diagnoses were enrolled. At least one virus was identified in 75.4% children, of which 7.5% were co-infections; 13.3% were positive for parainfluenza, 11.9% for influenza, 8.1% for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and 7.5% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Rainfall correlated with parainfluenza (p≤0.0001), influenza (p≤0.0001), hMPV (p= 0.0182), and RSV (p≤0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the spectrum of viruses in ill rural Honduran children is similar to that in North and Central America, though the seasonality is typical of some tropical regions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
