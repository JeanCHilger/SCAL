To date, no data on the immunogenicity of the replication-defective vaccinia virus (derived from the Tiantan strain) (rNTV)-based HCV vaccine in primates have been reported. This study describes in detail the immunogenicity of various vaccine candidates in rhesus macaques, including rNTV-based and replication-defective recombinant adenoviral (rAd)–based HCV vaccines, as well as HCV pseudotyped virus-like particles (HCVpp). Our data showed that rAd-HCV vaccine boosting induced robust CMI, while priming or boosting with HCVpp enhanced the antigen-specific nAb response after rAd-HCV vaccination; however, CMI was not enhanced. Vaccination includes rNTV-HCV priming induced robust antigen-specific antibody, particularly nAbs, and CMI responses. Furthermore, more robust and longer-lasting CMI and higher cytokine levels (both Th1 and Th2 types, especially IFN-γ) resulted from boosting with rAd-HCV. We conclude that the rNTV-based HCV vaccine induces robust nAbs and CMI when combined with a heterogeneous primer-booster strategy, which shows promise for development of a human HCV vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
