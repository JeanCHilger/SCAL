Using a system based on transfection of cells with synthetic nonreplicable subgenomic transcripts derived from bovine viral diarrhea virus (family Flaviviridae), the existence of a replication-independent mechanism of RNA recombination, in addition to the commonly accepted replicative copy-choice recombination, has been previously proven (A. Gallei et al., J. Virol. 78:6271–6281, 2004). To identify RNA signals involved in efficient joining of RNA molecules, RNA recombination in living cells was targeted to the 3′ nontranslated region. Molecular characterization of 40 independently emerged recombinant viruses revealed that the majority of recombination sites are located in single-stranded regions of the RNA molecules. Furthermore, the results of this study showed that the frequency of RNA recombination directly correlated with the RNA amounts of both recombination partners. The frequency can be strongly increased by modification of the 5′ triphosphates and 3′ hydroxyls of the recombining RNA molecules to 5′ hydroxyl and 3′ monophosphoryl ends, respectively. Analysis of recombinants that emerged after transfection with such modified RNA molecules revealed a complete integration and efficient end-to-end joining of the recombination partner(s) in at least 80% of recombinants, while unmodified RNA molecules recombined exclusively at internal positions. These results are in line with the hypothesis that endoribonucleolytic cleavage and a subsequent ligation reaction can cause RNA recombination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
