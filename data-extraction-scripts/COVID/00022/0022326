We report a complete genome sequence of a novel HPeV strain, CH-ZJ1, that was found in an infant with gastroenteritis in Zhenjiang City, China. The complete genome consists of 7,298 nucleotides (nt), excluding the 3â€² poly(A) tail; the open reading frame is mapped between nucleotide positions 654 and 7211 and encodes a 2,185-amino acid (aa) polyprotein. The phylogenetic tree obtained for the complete genome of this HPeV strain and the other HpeV strains available in GenBank indicated that CH-ZJ1 is intervenient between HpeV type 4 (HpeV4) and HpeV5. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 3D and VP1 genes reveals two incongruent trees. Recombination detection indicated that CH-ZJ1 might be a recombinant which was produced by more than one genomic recombination event that occurred among HPeV1, HPeV4, and HPeV3 strains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
