Here, we show that both uncommitted and polarized Th cells bound by Gal-1 expressed an immunoregulatory signature defined by IL-10. IL-10synthesis was stimulated by direct Gal-1 engagement to cell surface glycoproteins, principally CD45, on activated Th cells and enhanced by IL-21 expression through the c-Maf/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, independent of antigen-presenting cells. Gal-1-induced IL-10(+) Tcells efficiently suppressed T cell proliferation and T-cell-mediated inflammation and promoted the establishment of cancer immune-privileged sites. Collectively, these findings show how Gal-1 functions as a major glycome determinant regulating Th cell development, inflammation and tumor immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
