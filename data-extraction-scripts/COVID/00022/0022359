Analyses are based on the cohort of 8006 Japanese American men (b. 1900 – 1919) followed since 1965 as a part of the Honolulu Heart Program, continued as the Honolulu Asia Aging Study. Mid-life cardiovascular risk factors and late-life brain function are well described. We estimated the PAR of dementia cases attributed to mid-life SBP, grouped by JCN-7 criteria [<120, 120 – < 140, and ≥ 140 mmHG], taking into account treatment history, confounding factors, and competitive risk for death. The analysis is based on 7878 subjects, including 491 cases of dementia, with a mean interval of 25 years between measurement of BP and dementia diagnosis. Compared to those with SBP <120 mmHG, untreated and <50 years at baseline, 17.7% (95% CI 4.6% – 29.1%) of the cases are attributable to prehypertensive levels (SBP 120 – <140 mmHG) of SBP, translating into 11 excess cases per 1000. Among those who did not report taking anti-hypertensive medication in mid-life, 27% [95%CI 8.9%, 42.1%] of dementia cases can be attributed to systolic BP >120 mmHG, translating into 17 excess cases per 1000. Although PAR estimates for population sub –groups may differ by relative risk for dementia or prevalence of elevated levels of BP, these data suggest reducing mid-life systolic BP is an effective prevention strategy to reduce risk for late-life dementia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
