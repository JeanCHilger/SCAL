Challenge with a 10(2) 50% cell culture infectious doses of YFV resulted in a 50–80% mortality rate in female hamsters. Virus was detected by QRT-PCR in liver, kidney, spleen, and serum with peak titers on 4–6 days post-viral challenge (dpi). Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, and creatinine were significantly elevated, while serum levels of albumin, amylase, glucose, calcium, globulin, phosphorus, sodium, and total protein were significantly reduced. Packed cell volume and white blood cell count were significantly elevated during the course of the infection. Intraperitoneal treatment of hamsters with 0.5–5 μg/kg/d interferon (IFN) alfacon-1, 100 mg/kg/d viramidine, or 50 mg/kg/d ribavirin, initiated 4 h prior to YFV challenge, resulted in significant improvement in survival and serum ALT levels. Treatment with IFN alfacon-1 or ribavirin starting 2 dpi, also significantly improved survival and serum ALT levels in hamsters challenged with YFV. Pre- and post-virus exposure treatment with IFN alfacon-1 was efficacious in improving disease in YFV-infected hamsters.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
