Abundant presence of ACE2 in the lungs, and its impressive effect in the prevention of acute lung injury, led us to test the hypothesis that pulmonary overexpression of this enzyme could produce beneficial outcomes against PH. Monocrotaline (MCT) treatment of mice for eight weeks resulted in significant increases in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricle/left ventricle + septal (RV/LV+S) weight ratio and muscularization of pulmonary vessels. Administration of a lentiviral vector containing ACE2 (lenti-ACE2) seven days prior to MCT treatment prevented the increases in RVSP (Control: 25 ± 1 mmHg; MCT: 44 ± 5 mmHg; MCT+ACE2: 26 ± 1 mmHg, n=6, p<0.05) and RV/LV +S weight ratio (Control: 0.25 ± 0.01 mg/mg; MCT: 0.31 ± 0.01 mg/mg; MCT+ACE2: 0.26 ± 0.01mg/mg, n=8, p<0.05). A significant attenuation in muscularization of pulmonary vessels induced by MCT was also observed in animals overexpressing ACE2. These beneficial effects were associated with an increase in the AT(2) receptor/AT(1) receptor mRNA ratio. Also, PH-induced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly attenuated by lenti-ACE2 treatment. Furthermore, ACE2 gene transfer in mice following six weeks of MCT treatment resulted in significant reversal of RVSP. These observations demonstrate that ACE2 overexpression prevents and reverses RVSP and associated pathophysiology in MCT-induced PH by a mechanism involving a shift from the vasoconstrictive, proliferative and fibrotic axis to the vasoprotective axis of the renin-angiotensin system and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
