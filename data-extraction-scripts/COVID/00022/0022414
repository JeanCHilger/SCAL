Currently, estimation of humoral immune recovery is inferred from lymphocyte counts or immunoglobulin levels and does not address vulnerability to specific viral infections. We interrogated the viral antibody repertoire before and after HCT using a novel serosurvey (VirScan) that detects immunoglobulin G responses to 206 viruses. We performed VirScan on cryopreserved serum from pre-HCT and 30, 100, and 365 days after myeloablative HCT from 37 donor-recipient pairs. We applied ecologic metrics (α- and β-diversity) and evaluated predictors of metrics and changes over time. Donor age and donor/recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus and receipt systemic glucocorticoids were most strongly associated with VirScan metrics at day 100. Other clinical characteristics, including pre-HCT treatment and conditioning, did not affect antiviral repertoire metrics. The recipient repertoire was most similar (pairwise β-diversity) to that of donor at day 100, but more similar to pre-HCT self by day 365. Gain or loss of epitopes to common viruses over the year post-HCT differed by donor and recipient pre-HCT serostatus, with highest gains in naive donors to seropositive recipients for several human herpesviruses and adenoviruses. We used VirScan to highlight contributions of donor and recipient to antiviral humoral immunity and evaluate longitudinal changes. This work builds a foundation to test whether such systematic profiling could serve as a biomarker of immune reconstitution, predict clinical events after HCT, or help refine selection of optimal donors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
