OBJECTIVE: Evaluate safety/efficacy of a proprietary extract of Panax quinequefolius, CVT-E002 (Afexa Life Sciences) to reduce ARI. METHODS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial:293 subjects with early-stage, untreated CLL January-March, 2009. RESULTS: ARI days were common occurring on about 10% of days during the study period. There were no significant differences of the two a priori primary endpoints: ARI days (8.5 ± 17.2 for CVT-E002 vs. 6.8 ± 13.3 for placebo) or severe ARI days (2.9 ± 9.5 for CVT-E002 vs. 2.6 ± 9.8 for placebo). However, 51% percent of CVT-E002 vs. 56% of placebo recipients experienced at least one ARI (diff -5%, 95% C.I. -16%,7%); more intense ARI occurred in 32% of CVT-E002 vs. 39% of placebo recipients (diff -7%, 95% C.I. -18%, 4%), and symptom-specific evaluation showed reduced moderate-severe sore throat (p = 0.004) and a lower rate of grade ≥3 toxicities (p = 0.02) in CVT-E002 recipients. Greater seroconversion (4-fold increases in antibody titer) vs. 9 common viral pathogens was documented in CVT-E002 recipients (16% vs. 7%; p = 0.04). LIMITATIONS: Serologic evaluation of antibody titers were not tied to a specific illness, but evaluated over the entire study period. CONCLUSION: CVT-E002 was well tolerated.CVT-E002 did not reduce the number of ARI days or antibiotic use; however, there was a trend toward reduced rates of moderate-severe ARI and significantly less sore throat, suggesting the increased rate of seroconversion most likely reflects CVT-E002-enhanced antibody responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
