Transient infections with BVDV were also assessed by virus isolation, virus neutralization (VN) assays, and direct buffy coat 5′-UTR sequencing. Infections were demonstrated in all cattle by RT-rtPCR; however, the detection rate was dependent on the type of sample. Buffy coat samples demonstrated a significantly greater number of positive results (p ≤ 0.05) than either serum or nasal swab samples. Presence of elevated BVDV VN titers at the onset inversely correlated with the number of test days positive that an individual would be identified by RT-rtPCR from buffy coat samples, and directly correlated with the average Ct values accumulated over all RT-rtPCR test days from buffy coat samples. Both single and mixed genotype/subgenotype/strain infections were detected in individual cattle by direct sample 5′-UTR sequencing. A BVDV-2a strain from a PI animal was found to be the predominant strain infecting 64% of all non-PI cattle; BVDV-1b strains originating from 3 PI cattle were never detected in non-PI cattle. Although direct sample 5′-UTR sequencing was capable of demonstrating mixed BVDV infections, identifying all strains suspected was not always efficient or possible.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
