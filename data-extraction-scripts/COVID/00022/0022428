This study combined MAbs with an adenovirus-vectored interferon (DEF201) to evaluate the efficacy in guinea pigs and extend the treatment window obtained with MAbs alone. Initiating the combination therapy at 3 days postinfection (d.p.i.) provided 100% survival, a significant improvement over survival with either treatment alone. The administration of DEF201 within 2 d.p.i. permits later MAb use, with protective efficacy observed up to 8 d.p.i.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
