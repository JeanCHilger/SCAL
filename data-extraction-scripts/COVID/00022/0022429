The objectives of this study were to explore peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) against KSHV early lytic genes and assess their efficacy in SCID mice against PEL engraftment. PPMOs are short single-stranded DNA analogs that contain a backbone of morpholine rings and phosphorodiamidate linkages and have high delivery efficiency into cells. METHODS: PEL cells were treated with PPMOs against viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF-1) and expression of vIRF-1 was analyzed. The PPMOs against vIRF-1 and viral interleukin 6 (vIL-6) were evaluated against PEL cell engraftment in SCID mice. The PPMOs were administered into peritoneal cavities of SCID mice for ten doses at two-day intervals. At week 3 and 9 after BCBL-1 delivery, peritoneal lavage was collected and the ratio of PEL cells among total cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Treatment of PEL cells with PPMOs against vIRF-1 led to reduction of vIRF-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction of vIRF-1 expression resulted in higher levels of cellular IRF-3 and STAT1 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 1). SCID mice receiving a PPMO against vIL-6 had no engraftment of PEL cells and remained healthy throughout the 120-day study. CONCLUSION: This study showed that PPMOs can be effective antivirals against KSHV. Blocking expression of early lytic genes may lead to beneficial effect for control of KSHV-associated malignant diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
