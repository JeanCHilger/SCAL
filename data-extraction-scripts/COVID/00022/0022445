<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-04-11</DATELINE><TITLE>New Structure Model for the Packaging Signal in the Genome of Group IIa Coronaviruses</TITLE><BODY>A 190-nucleotide (nt) packaging signal (PS) located in the 3â€² end of open reading frame 1b in the mouse hepatitis virus, a group IIa coronavirus, was previously postulated to direct genome RNA packaging. Based on phylogenetic data and structure probing, we have identified a 95-nt hairpin within the 190-nt PS domain which is conserved in all group IIa coronaviruses but not in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (group IIb), group I coronaviruses, or group III coronaviruses. The hairpin is composed of six copies of a repeating structural subunit that consists of 2-nt bulges and 5-bp stems. We propose that repeating AA bulges are characteristic features of group IIa PSs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
