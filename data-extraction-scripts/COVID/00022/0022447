All initial validation studies with the control DNA proved to be type specific. The colorimetric type-specific LAMP assay could achieve a sensitivity of 10 to 100 copies at 63Â°C for 65 min, comparable to that of real-time PCR. In order to evaluate the reliability of HPV type-specific LAMP, the assay was further evaluated with HPV DNAs from a panel of 294 clinical specimens whose HPV status was previously determined with a novel one-step typing method with multiplex PCR. The tested panel comprised 108 HPV DNA-negative samples and 186 HPV-DNA-positive samples of 14 genotypes. The results showed that the sensitivity of HPV type-specific LAMP for HPV types 16, 18, 45, 52, and 58 was 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and the specificity was 100%, 98.5%, 100%, 98.8%, and 99.2%, respectively, compared with a novel one-step typing method with multiplex PCR. No cross-reactivity with other HPV genotypes was observed. In conclusion, this qualitative and colorimetric LAMP assay has potential usefulness for the rapid screening of HPV genotype 16, 18, 45, 52, and 58 infections, especially in resource-limited hospitals or rural clinics of provincial and municipal regions in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
