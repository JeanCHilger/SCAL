<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-10-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Spontaneous pathology of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and tamarins (Saguinus oedipus, Saguinus mystax)</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Marmosets and tamarins are increasingly used in research, but their pathology remains poorly defined compared to old world primates. METHODS: Necropsy records of 129 marmosets and 52 tamarins were reviewed; none were used experimentally. RESULTS: The most common marmoset lesions were dehydration, emaciation, nephritis, colitis and inanition. The most common tamarin lesions were dehydration, ascites, emaciation and congestive heart failure. Colitis and heart disease were the most common cause of death in marmosets and tamarins, respectively. Immature marmoset and tamarin deaths often occurred within the first month of life. Immature marmosets usually died from inanition, stillbirth and colitis; immature tamarins from atelectasis, stillbirth, heart failure and colitis. Lymphoma was the most common neoplasm for both marmosets and tamarins. CONCLUSION: The findings were similar to prior reports with differences in frequency and severity. We report the first case of endometriosis in a marmoset.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
