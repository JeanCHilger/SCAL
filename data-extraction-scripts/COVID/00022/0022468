However, in contrast to the signaling pathways that promote antiviral transcription, those that initiate cell death following virus infection remain less understood. Several recent studies identified pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the mammalian innate immune system that activate cell death pathways. These same receptors also have established roles in the induction of antiviral gene expression. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which PRRs can serve dual roles as initiators of inflammatory gene expression and inducers of apoptosis and necroptosis following virus infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
