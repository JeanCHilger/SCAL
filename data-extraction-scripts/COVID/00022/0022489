In this study, the protein and mRNA transcripts of IgG were found in the cytoplasm of human umbilical endothelial cells by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The essential enzymes for IgG synthesis and assembling, RAG1 (recombination activating gene 1), RAG2, and variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments for recombination of IgG, were also found in these cells by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. These results indicate that umbilical endothelial cells are capable of synthesizing IgG with properties similar to those of immune cells and that they may play additional roles besides lining the vessels and transporting IgG.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
