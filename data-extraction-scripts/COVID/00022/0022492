We sought to develop a complementary pharmacological approach whereby proteasome-mediated FLT3 degradation could be promoted by identifying inhibitors of the deubiquitinating enzyme(s) (DUBs) responsible for cleaving ubiquitin from FLT3. As the relevant DUBs for FLT3 are not known, we assembled a focused library of most reported small molecule DUB inhibitors and performed a cellular phenotypic screen to identify compounds that could induce degradation of oncogenic FLT3. Subsequent target deconvolution efforts allowed us to identify USP10 as the critical DUB required to stabilize FLT3. Targeting USP10 showed efficacy in FLT3-ITD positive pre-clinical models of AML, including cell lines, primary patient specimens and mouse models of oncogenic FLT3-driven leukemia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
