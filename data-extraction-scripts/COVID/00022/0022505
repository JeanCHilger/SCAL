We have analyzed the evolution of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus during multiple passaging in the presence of an HR2-based fusion inhibitor. Drug-resistant variants emerged as a result of multiple substitutions in the spike fusion protein, notably within a 19-residue segment of the HR1 region. Strikingly, one mutation, an A1006V substitution, which consistently appeared first in four independently passaged viruses, was the main determinant of the resistance phenotype, suggesting that only limited options exist for escape from the inhibitory effect of the HR2 peptide.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
