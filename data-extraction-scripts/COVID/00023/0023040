Published data on the natural GA sources, antiviral activity of GA and its derivatives, clinical applications of GA-based drugs, and the properties of GA-containing biologically active nutrient additives are summarized. Possible mechanisms of the antiviral activity of GA and its derivatives are examined. It is shown that chemical modification of GA is a promising way of designing new highly active antiviral drugs for the prophylaxis and treatment of HIV, hepatitis B and C, corona-virus, and herpes simplex virus infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
