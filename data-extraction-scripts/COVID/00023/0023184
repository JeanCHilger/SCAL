The detection limit in our system was approximately 0.003 nM of protein sample. Our result showed that this technique was more competitive than isotope-labeling EMSA. We demonstrated AlGaN/GaN was highly potential in constructing a semiconductor-based-sensor binding assay to extract the dissociation constants of nucleic acid-protein interaction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
