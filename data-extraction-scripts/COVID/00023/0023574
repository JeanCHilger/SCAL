These accumulations of CD8 T-cells have the potential to distort T-cell population balance and reduce T-cell repertoire diversity above and beyond the changes seen in the aging of T-cell pool in the absence of TCE. This chapter discusses our current knowledge of the role of these expansions in health and disease, with a special focus on their influence upon immune defense against infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
