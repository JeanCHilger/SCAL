<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-07-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Bioorganometallic Chemistry and Malaria</TITLE><BODY>This chapter summarizes recent developments in the design, synthesis, and structureâ€“activity relationship studies of organometallic antimalarials. It begins with a general introduction to malaria and the biology of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, with a focus on the heme detoxification system. Then, a number of metal complexes from the literature are reported for their antiplasmodial activity. The second half of the chapter deals with the serendipitous discovery of ferroquine, its mechanism(s) of action, and the failure to induce a resistance. Last, but not least, we suggest that the bioorganometallic approach offers the potential for the design of novel therapeutic agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
