<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-08-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Eukaryote Genomes</TITLE><BODY>General overviews of eukaryote genomes are first discussed, including organelle genomes, introns, and junk DNAs. We then discuss the evolutionary features of eukaryote genomes, such as genome duplication, C-value paradox, and the relationship between genome size and mutation rates. Genomes of multicellular organisms, plants, fungi, and animals are then briefly discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
