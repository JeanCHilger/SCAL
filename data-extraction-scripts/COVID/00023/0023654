Differential expression profiles of miRNAs were shown linking to specific disease pathologies which indicated its potency as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of infectious disease. This was emphasized by the discovery of circulating miRNAs which were found to be remarkably stable in mammalian biofluids. Standardized methods of miRNA quantification including RNA isolation should be established before they will be ready for use in clinical practice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
