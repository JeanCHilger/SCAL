<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005</DATELINE><TITLE>Defining Drug Interactions with the Viral Membrane Protein Vpu from HIV-1</TITLE><BODY>The replication of HIV-1 is strongly enhanced by a small membrane protein called virus protein U (Vpu). Vpu achieves its task by (a) interacting with CD4, the HIV-1 receptor, and (b) by amplifying particle release at the site of the plasma membrane. While the first role is due to interactions of the cytoplasmic site of Vpu with CD4, the second role may be due to ion channel activity caused by the self-assembly of the protein. Recently, a blocker has been proposed which abolishes channel activity. In this chapter, the mechanism of blocking is described using computational methods, including a brief overview of other viral ion channel blockers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
