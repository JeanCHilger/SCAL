Whereas an impressive body of literature continues to uncover pleiotropic effects of Ang II in the regulation of cell function, research on Ang-(1–7) has a shorter history as it was only 16 yr ago that a biological function for this heptapeptide was first demonstrated in the isolated rat neuro-hypophysial explant preparation (1). On the contrary, the synthesis of angiotonin/ hypertensin (now Ang II) was first obtained in 1957 (2), three decades ahead of the discovery of Ang-(1–7) biological properties.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
