It is a multifactorial system since it includes different components (Fig. 1): The first, renin, was discovered in 1898 [1], whereas the discovery of the last component, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), is relatively recent, from 2000 [2, 3]. Three kinds of RAS are known: A) circulating, B) local, and C) intracellular.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
