<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-07-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Other Complications</TITLE><BODY>Ventilator-associated pneumonia occurs in patients who have been intubated for two to three days with significant exposure to hospital-acquired organisms. Treatment should be initiated rapidly and cover P. aeruginosa, Escheriochia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Acinetobacter species as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Within 72 h or with the availability of culture results, antibiotics should be narrowed. Active research is on-going to identify patients at risk for ventilator-associated complications and to minimize the likelihood of infection in these patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
