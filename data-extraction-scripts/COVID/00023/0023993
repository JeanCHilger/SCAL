<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-09-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Detection of Bovine Coronavirus by Conventional Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction</TITLE><BODY>Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an economically significant cause of enteric and respiratory diseases in cattle throughout the world. BCoV is a known cause of neonatal calf diarrhea, winter dysentery in adult cattle, and respiratory disorders in cattle of all ages. In this chapter, we describe a simple and efficient protocol for total nucleic acids extraction to be used in conventional RT-PCR assay. This is a technique used routinely in our virology laboratory to detect BCoV from stool and nasopharyngeal samples of cattle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
