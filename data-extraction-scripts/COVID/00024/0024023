<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular Epidemiology, Genomics, and Phylogeny of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus</TITLE><BODY>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) constitutes a group of viruses of the genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae). Like all members of the Bunyaviridae, the genome of CCHFV is composed of tripartite single-stranded RNA. These segments, designated small (S), medium (M), and large (L), minimally encode the nucleocapsid (N), envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively [38].&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
