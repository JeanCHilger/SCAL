Although the great majority of cases are benign and self-limited, requiring no intervention, some patients need respiratory support. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a critical intervention in many cases of acute respiratory failure (ARF), but there are absolute risks associated with endotracheal intubation (ETI). On the other hand, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is an extremely valuable alternative to IMV. A major reason for the increasing use of NIV has been the desire to avoid the complications of IMV. It is generally much safer than IMV and has been shown to decrease resource utilization. Its use also avoids the complications and side effects associated with ETI, including upper airway trauma, laryngeal swelling, postextubation vocal cord dysfunction, nosocomial infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. There are a number of advantages of NIV including leaving the upper airway intact, preserving the natural defense mechanisms of the upper airways, decreasing the need for sedation, maintaining the ability to talk while undergoing NIV, and reducing the length of hospitalization and its associated costs [1â€“3].&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
