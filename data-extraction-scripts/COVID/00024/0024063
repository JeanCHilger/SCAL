<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-05-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Preventing Airborne Disease Transmission: Implications for Patients During Mechanical Ventilation</TITLE><BODY>The organisms causing respiratory infections such as influenza are spread in droplets or aerosols or by direct or indirect contact with contaminated surfaces. Certain medical procedures have been termed aerosol generating because they are associated with high or augmented inspiratory and expiratory flows, which can increase microbial dissemination. Invasive ventilation maneuvers and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) fall into that category. We discuss the risk of transmitting these procedures and the strategies for mechanical ventilation in future airborne epidemics with special consideration given to the issue of protecting health care workers (HCWs).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
