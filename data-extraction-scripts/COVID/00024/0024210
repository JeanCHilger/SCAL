This paradigm provides a complex lesion environment to examine cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in successful CNS remyelination. Our work in this model has focused on the roles of platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 in regulating oligodendrocyte progenitor responses required for remyelination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
