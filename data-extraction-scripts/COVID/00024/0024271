<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-11-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Vertebrates as Hosts and Reservoirs of Zoonotic Microbial Agents</TITLE><BODY>This chapter presents a survey of zoonotic microorganisms that have been isolated from vertebrates (Vertebrata), and are potentially transmissible to humans. It is intended as an aid for microbiologists, zoologists and epidemiologists, making possible better orientation among hosts (and reservoirs) of zoonoses. A great number of sources have been used in this compilation, e.g. Davis et al. (1970), Kucheruk (1979, 1989), Karabatsos (1985–1995), Hubálek (1994), etc.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
