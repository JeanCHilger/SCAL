<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005</DATELINE><TITLE>The Role of T Cell Epitopes in Coronavirus Infection</TITLE><BODY>Multiple MHV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes have been identified in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. In particular, at least two CD8 T cell epitopes are recognized in C57Bl/6 mice. In one model of MHV persistence, mutations are detected in the immunodominant CD8 T cell epitope recognized in this strain. These mutations contribute to virus persistence and to the development of more severe clinical disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
