He had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor 17 months previously. His posttransplant course was complicated by graft versus host disease and multiple central venous catheter infections with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus.
