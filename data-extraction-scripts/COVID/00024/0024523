<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-03-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Probing Biology with Small Molecule Microarrays (SMM)</TITLE><BODY>In the continuous drive to increase screening throughput and reduce sample requirement, microarray-based technologies have risen to the occasion. In the past 7 years, a number of new methodologies have been developed for preparing small molecule microarrays from combinatorial and natural product libraries with the goal of identifying new interactions or enzymatic activities. Recent advances and applications of small molecule microarrays are reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
