<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Indoor Microbial Aerosol and Its Health Effects: Microbial Exposure in Public Buildings â€“ Viruses, Bacteria, and Fungi</TITLE><BODY>Mechanisms of aerosolization of microorganisms, composition and dynamics of microbioaerosol are characterized. As well as methods of its detection, incl. modern equipment set-ups and sampling procedures recommended are outlined. Medical impact of (indoor) air disperged viral, bacterial and fungal propagules (allergies, intoxications, infections), together with the related European legislation is summarized. An overview of real mycoaerosol conditions in our dwellings and their outdoors with different microclimate, settlement and building types, household characteristics and health state of occupants is given, too. Finally, examples of several possible health damages due to exposition to (aerosolized) fungal toxicants in vitro and in vivo are demonstrated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
