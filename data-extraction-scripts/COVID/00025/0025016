<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Getting high on traffic: The biochemistry of intracellular transport</TITLE><BODY>Molecular mechanisms of secretory and endocytic transport pathways were the focus of a recent ASBMB Special Symposium on Biochemistry of Membrane Traffic, held last October in the picturesque high-altitude setting of Lake Tahoe. An exciting and diverse array of research and discussion topics focused on recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of movement of protein and membrane through the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Highlights included discussions of the common structural and functional features of tethering complexes, the roles of the lipid PI 4P in the late secretory pathway, organization of specific ER sub-domains and a new look at Golgi biogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
