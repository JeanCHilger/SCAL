Presently attractive theories for immune injury in viral bronchiolitis include those which depend on pathology induced by types 1, 3, and 4 of Gell and Coombs. The continuum of viral bronchiolitis with virus-induced wheezing in young children who are labeled “asthmatic” argues for some common mechanism of bronchiolar obstruction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
