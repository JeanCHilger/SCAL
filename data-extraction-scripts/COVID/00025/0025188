To fulfill such a role, crews must be shielded against even incipient degradation of performance capacity. The space environment contains potential hazardsranging from microgravity to infectious microorganisms to chemical toxicants. An extensive literature indicates that incipient disruptions of function may occur at low levels of exposure to toxic agents and degrade performance. Such questions need to be pursued before irreversible decisions are made about space vehicle design.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
