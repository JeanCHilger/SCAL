<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1986-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Effects of intravenously infused Fluosol-DA 20% in rats</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Rats were injected with a fractionated 50 ml/kg dose of FluosolÂ®-DA 20% with and without exposure to 100% oxygen. Animals were killed at 24, 43, 92, and 183 days post-treatment and samples taken for hematological, hepatic enzyme, histological, and perfluorochemical analyses. There were no significant differences in hemograms or hepatic enzyme findings between treatment and control groups. Differences in organ weights and histology were a result of perfluorochemical (PFC) accumulation in the tissues of treated animals. All changes were reversible. There were no effects from breathing high oxygen levels in either treatment or control animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
