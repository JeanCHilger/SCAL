This variability is independent of the breeding characteristics of the strain. The two strains differed in the slope of the survival curves, with Fischer 344 rats showing a higher survival over the second year of life as well as a lower interindividual variability. A model-free approach based on principal component analysis allowed us to quantify these differences and to highlight some limitations of the classical Gompertzian approach.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
