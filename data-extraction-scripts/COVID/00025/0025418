Female dairy calves (n = 410) born from January to December 1990 in 18 commercial herds in New York state were used. Average daily gains during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd mo were 374, 596, and 719g, respectively; average gain was 565g during the 3-mo period. Average monthly height gains during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd mo were 4.4, 5.6, and 5.7cm, respectively. Use of multiple linear regression, with farms treated as random effects, indicated that treated, verified pneumonia was associated with a reduction in average daily gain of 66g and that failure of passive transfer reduced average daily gain by 48g during the 1st mo. During the 2nd mo, neither disease nor failure of passive transfer affected average daily gain. During the 3rd mo, each additional week of pneumonia reduced average daily gain by 14g, and umbilical infection reduced average daily gain by 96g. Each additional week of diagnosed pneumonia reduced total BW gain during the first 3 mo by 0.8kg. Similarly, each week of pneumonia reduced total height gain by 0.2cm and failure of passive transfer by 0.9cm. Prevention of chronic pneumonia and umbilical infection may improve average daily gain of calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
