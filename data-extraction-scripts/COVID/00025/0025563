B., S. J. Chirtel and R. S. Redman. Effect of substance P and receptor antagonists on secretion of lingual lipase and amylase from rat von Ebner's gland. Peptides 18(2) 277–285, 1997.— Substance P (SP, 1 μM) when incubated with minced von Ebner's glands for 15, 30, and 60 min, stimulated secretion of lingual lipase (12.14%±0.90) and amylase (8.30%±0.42). Only 10 μM of the SP receptor antagonist CP-96,345 significantly inhibited SP-evoked secretion. d-Pro2-d-Phe7-d-Trp9-SP (Ia), d-Pro2-d-Trp7,9-SP (Ib), d-Arg1-d-Trp7,9-d-Leu11-SP (Ic), or 1 μM CP-96,345 were not effective, suggesting that the SP receptor of von Ebner's gland might be an isoform. Propranolol and timolol, β 1/β 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists were not effective and the cholinergic receptor antagonist, atropine, was effective in only slightly reducing amylase secretion but not lingual lipase. Differential secretion of the two enzymes was observed for basal and stimulated secretion. Thus, exocytosis may not be the only pathway involved in SP-evoked protein secretion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
