Most of the derivatives exhibited potent anti-HBV activity, especially inhibiting the HBV DNA replication with the IC50 values from 2.44 to 22.89 μΜ. Compound 18 showed significant activity against the secretion of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA replication with IC50 values of 5.52, 5.52, 2.44 μΜ, respectively, and had good safety (LD50 > 1250 mg/kg) according to the acute toxicity study. Preliminary mechanism investigation suggested that compound 18 exerted antivirus effects via interfering HBV X promoter and enhancer I to influence HBV transcriptions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
