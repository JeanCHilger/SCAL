We extracted the data on 14 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinhua Municipal Central hospital through January 27th, 2020. We found that compared to pharyngeal swab specimens, nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 in fecal specimens was equally accurate. And we found that patients with a positive stool test did not experience gastrointestinal symptoms and had nothing to do with the severity of the lung infection. These results may help to understand the clinical diagnosis and the changes of clinical parameters of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
