The use of viral components for vaccination has been the subject of experimental clinical trials with adenoviruses and influenza subunit vaccines are in current use. The effect of the production of antibodies against viral components during the course of infection is in vivo complement fixation, demonstrable in practice by the developing anti-complementary activity of serum. Other antibody reactions, which may or may not result in neutralization of infectivity, may play an important role in the production of lesions, especially in certain persistent viral infections. Immune complexes in which viral antigens rather than virions are involved may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of some acute infections, such as hemorrhagic dengue and in the glomerulonephritis found in several chronic viral infections. Indeed, antigenemia and the early formation of immune complexes, rather than viremia as such, may provide the pathogenetic basis for the fever and symptoms that mark the end of the incubation period in many generalized viral infections and the prodromal rash may have a similar explanation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
