Adsorption with hydroxylapatite successfully removed virus from faecal material. However, the resultant virus was contaminated and some virus was left behind in the faecal suspension. Repeated adsorption with hydroxylapatite appeared to result in some damage to the virus particles. In contrast, density gradient centrifugation provided a simple, economical method of purification which yielded uncontaminated, infectious virus. The final method, using both isopyknic and rate zonal centrifugation is described.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
