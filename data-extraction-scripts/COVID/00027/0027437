<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1994-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Enteric Infectious Disease in Neonates Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and a Practical Approach to Evaluation and Therapy</TITLE><BODY>There are many bacterial and viral pathogens that have been associated with enteric disease during the newborn period. These pathogens have widely different mechanisms of action on the intestinal epithelium and are associated with a spectrum of clinical findings. Infected infants can be asymptomatic, have gastroenteritis, or have a fulminant sepsis picture. To determine therapy and institute appropriate infection control measures requires the ability to recognize the clinical syndrome and correctly interpret laboratory results. All of these principles can be applied to the premature infant in the neonatal intensive care nursery as well as the full-term infant at home.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
