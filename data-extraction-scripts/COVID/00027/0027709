Alcohol eradicated all bacteria in 10 of 35 participants, but with an average (SD) of 2330 (4227) CFU/mL left after disinfection, while ozonized water removed all bacteria in 10 of 55 participants, with an average of only 538 (801) CFU/mL left (p=0.045). Soap washing was the most effective with total removal of bacteria in 6 of 20 participants, with an average of 98 (139) CFU/ml (p=0.048 and 0.018 versus ozonized water and alcohol, respectively).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
