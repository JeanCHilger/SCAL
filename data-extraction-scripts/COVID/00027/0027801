Based on evaluation indicators for AIDS treatment using TCM, we discuss why the survival rate (which has been used widely in Western Medicine) should be adopted as a new important indicator of TCM treatment for AIDS. We advise that further prospective or retrospective cohort studies should be carried out to confirm this hypothesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
