In this chapter, the rapid chromatographic separation of natural oligomeric or polymeric compounds containing important molecular moieties of a different type are discussed, such as nucleoprotein complexes, glycolipids, glycopeptides and glycoside oligomeric derivatives. In addition, separations of several natural complex substances that are not well known are discussed. This chapter concludes with a brief discussion on the separation techniques used for the miscellaneous polymeric and oligomeric substances.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
