<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Characteristic ECG Manifestations in Patients with COVID-19</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Cardiac involvement has been reported in patients with COVID-19, which may be reflected by ECG changes. Two COVID-19 cases in our report exhibited different ECG manifestations as the disease caused deterioration. The first case presented temporary SIQIIITIII morphology followed by reversible nearly complete atrioventricular block, while the second demonstrated ST segment elevation accompanied by multifocal ventricular tachycardia. The underlying mechanisms of these electrocardiographic abnormalities in the severe stage of COVID-19 may be attributed to hypoxia and inflammatory damage incurred by the virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
