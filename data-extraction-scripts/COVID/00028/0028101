<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Goals of Care in a Pandemic: Our Experience and Recommendations</TITLE><BODY>Abstract: We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two waves: first communication and second symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
