<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Palliative Care Pandemic Pack: a Specialist Palliative Care Service response to planning the COVID-19 pandemic.</TITLE><BODY>Abstract: Specialist Palliative Care services (SPCS) have a vital role to play in the global COVID-19 pandemic. Core expertise in complex symptom management, decision-making in uncertainty, advocacy and education, and ensuring a compassionate response are essential, and SPCS are well positioned to take a proactive approach in crisis management planning. SPCS resource capacity is likely to be overwhelmed, and consideration needs to be given to empowering and supporting high-quality primary palliative care in all care locations. Our local SPCS have developed a Palliative Care Pandemic Pack to disseminate succinct and specific information, guidance, and resources designed to enable the rapid up-skilling of non-specialist clinicians needing to provide palliative care. It may be a useful tool for our SPCS colleagues to adapt as we face this global challenge collaboratively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
