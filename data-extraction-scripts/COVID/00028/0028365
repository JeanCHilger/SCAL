<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Evaluation of Diarrhea in HIV-Infected Patients</TITLE><BODY>Diarrhea is a major problem for patients infected with HIV: initial studies indicated that 50% of HIV-seropositive patients developed diarrhea, but this may be an underestimate. Diarrhea has an appreciable adverse affect on the quality of life of these patients; also, they use more health care facilities and health care dollars than HIV-positive patients without diarrhea. Individuals who have homosexuality or bisexuality as their HIV risk factor are more likely to have diarrhea and to have an enteric pathogen identified as the cause of diarrhea than are patients who have heterosexuality or intravenous drug use as their risk factor.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
