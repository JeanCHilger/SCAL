<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Small Intestine Pathogens in AIDS: Conventional and Opportunistic</TITLE><BODY>The small intestine, coming in direct contact with ingested potential pathogens, depends on active mucosal immunity to withstand invasion and damage. In patients with AIDS and severe impairment of immunoregulatory lymphocytes, proliferation of protozoal, viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens produces diarrhea and malabsorption. When noninvasive tests of stool and blood fail to identify responsible organisms, endoscopy can reveal mucosal lesions which are suggestive if not diagnostic. Cryptosporidium, E. intestinalis, CMV, MAC, and other infections can be identified by intestinal biopsy quicker and often at lower overall cost than they can be by culture.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
