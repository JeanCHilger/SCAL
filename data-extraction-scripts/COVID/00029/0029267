It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which Bcl-2 suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase after serum starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells. Based on the fact that ROS mediate cell cycle progression, and are controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), a key molecule induced by prolonged starvation and involved in mitochondrial metabolism, we hypothesized that PGC-1α might be related with the cell cycle function of Bcl-2. Here, we showed that PGC-1α was upregulated upon Bcl-2 overexpression and downregulated following Bcl-2 knockdown during serum starvation. Knockdown of PGC-1α activated Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that after serum depletion, PGC-la might coordinate with Bcl-2 to reduce ROS, which in turn delay cell cycle progression.Summary statementPGC-1α coordinate with Bcl-2 delay cell cycle progression to reduce ROS after serum depletion in human glioma U251 cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
