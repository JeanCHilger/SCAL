To infer when during animal evolution signaling pathways became associated with cilia, we characterized the proteomes of cilia from three organisms: sea urchins, sea anemones and choanoflagellates. From these ciliomes, we identified 437 high confidence ciliary candidate proteins conserved in mammals, including known regulators of Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling. The phylogenetic profiles of their ciliary association indicate that the Hh and GPCR pathways were linked to cilia before the origin of bilateria and TRP channels before the origin of animals. We demonstrated that some of the candidates not previously implicated in ciliary biology localized to cilia and further investigated ENKUR, a TRP channel-interacting protein that we identified in the cilia of all three organisms. In animals, ENKUR is expressed by cells with motile cilia, ENKUR localizes to cilia in diverse organisms and, in both Xenopus laevis and mice, ENKUR is required for patterning the left/right axis. Moreover, mutation of ENKUR causes situs inversus in humans. Thus, proteomic profiling of cilia from diverse eukaryotes defines a conserved ciliary proteome, reveals ancient connections to Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling, and uncovers a novel ciliary protein that controls vertebrate development and human disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
