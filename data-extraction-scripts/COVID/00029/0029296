However, substantial ecological diversity, both in virulence level and host range, is known within virus species. Here we demonstrate a proof of concept for easily discovering ecological diversity within a virus species taxon. We have focused on the West Nile Virus to take advantage of its broad host range in nature. We produced a genome-based phylogeny of world diversity of WNV and then used Ecotype Simulation 2 to hypothesize demarcation of genomes into 69 putative ecotypes (ecologically distinct populations), based only on clustering of genome sequences. Then we looked for evidence of ecological divergence among ecotypes based on differences in host bird associations within the Connecticut-New York region. Our results indicated significant heterogeneity among ecotypes for their associations with different bird hosts. Ecological diversity within other zoonotic viruses could be easily discovered using this approach. Opportunities for extending this line of research to human associations of virus ecotypes are limited by missing geographic metadata on human samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
