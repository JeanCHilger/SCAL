PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells.ObjectiveWe tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization.MethodsEndogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states.ResultsPAR-2 signaling in airway squamous cells activated calcium and inflammatory responses. Squamous cells cultured at air liquid interface (ALI) responded to PAR-2 agonists applied both apically and basolaterally. Primary well-differentiated nasal epithelial ALI cultures responded only to basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Primary cultures exposed to IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, or reduced retinoic acid responded to both apical and basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Nasal polyp tissue, but not control middle turbinate, exhibited apical calcium responses to PAR-2 stimulation. However, isolated ciliated cells from both polyp and turbinate maintained basolateral PAR-2 polarization.ConclusionsSquamous metaplasia and/or loss of cilia enhances apical PAR-2 responses. Altered PAR-2 polarization in dedifferentiated or remodeled epithelia may contribute to increased sensitivity to inhaled protease allergens in inflammatory airway diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
