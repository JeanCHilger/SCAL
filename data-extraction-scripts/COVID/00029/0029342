Knowledge about how distinct types of muscarinic GPCR signaling regulate microglia function in vitro and in vivo is still poor, partly due to the fact that some of these receptors are also present in astrocytes and neurons. We generated mice expressing the hM3Dq Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) selectively in microglia to investigate the role of muscarinic M3Gq-linked signaling. We show that activation of hM3Dq using clozapine N-oxide (CNO) elevated intracellular calcium levels and increased phagocytosis of FluoSpheres in vitro. Acute treatment with CNO in vivo did not affect male mouse behavior, however chronic CNO treatment decreased sickness behavior triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Interestingly, whereas acute treatment with CNO increased synthesis of cytokine mRNA, chronic treatment attenuated LPS-induced cytokine mRNA changes in the brain, likely explaining the improvement in sickness behavior by chronic hM3Dq activation. No effect of CNO was observed in DREADD-negative mice. These results suggest that chronic activation of M3 muscarinic receptors (the hM3Dq progenitor) in microglia, and potentially other Gq-coupled GPCRs, preconditions microglia to decrease their response to further immunological challenges. Our results indicate that hM3Dq can be a useful tool to modulate neuroinflammation and study microglial immunological memory in vivo, which may be applicable for manipulations of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.HighlightsMicroglial function was manipulated by specific activation of hM3Dq signaling.Chronic hM3Dq activation prevented LPS-induced sickness behavior in mice.Microglial hM3Dq signaling modulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
