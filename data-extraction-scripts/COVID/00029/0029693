In this work, we report a CRISPR-Cas12 based diagnostic tool to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences in a proof-of-principle evaluation. The test proved to be sensitive, rapid, and potentially portable. These key traits of the CRISPR method are critical for virus detection in regions that lack resources to use the currently available methods.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
