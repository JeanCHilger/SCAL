<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Ascertainment rate of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Japan</TITLE><BODY>We analyzed the epidemiological dataset of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Japan as of 28 February 2020 and estimated the number of severe and non-severe cases, accounting for under-ascertainment. The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases was estimated at 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.37, 0.50), indicating that unbiased number of non-cases would be more than twice the reported count. Severe cases are twice more likely diagnosed and reported than other cases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
