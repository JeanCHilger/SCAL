The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak. Those who suspended working reported worse health conditions by SF12 as well as distress (K6). The severity of the COVID-19 in individuals location predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by the existing chronic health issues and exercising hour of each individual. Interpretation Our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epistemologically. We need to support especially people who suspended working during the outbreak. Our results also highlight that people who are usually active, as indicated by more exercises, might be more suspectable to wellbeing issues due to the lockdown. Policymakers who are thinking of introducing measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and welling implications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
