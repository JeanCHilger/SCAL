Currently, real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples is reported to be 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed. Methodï¼šWe established a digital PCR (dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. Results: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the dPCR assays are about 1.6, 1.6 and 0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E gene. The limit of detection (LoD) is 2 copies/reaction. The overall accuracy of ddPCR is 95.5 %. For the fever suspected patients, the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% to 87.4% by dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. In addition, quantification of the virus load for convalescents by dPCR showed that a longer observation in the hospital is needed for aged patients. Conclusion: dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, dPCR is more sensitive and suitable for low virus load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
