A 66-year-old man with COVID-19 was admitted with acute flaccid paralysis of bilateral lower limbs and urinary and bowel incontinence. All serum microbiological studies were negative except for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. Clinical findings could be ascribed to a post-infectious acute myelitis. He was receiving treatment with ganciclovir, lopinavir/ritonavir, moxifloxacin, dexamethasone, human immunoglobulin and mecobalamin. With a diagnosis of post-infectious acute myelitis and comprehensive treatment, paralysis of bilateral lower extremities ameliorated. After two times negative novel coronavirus RNA nasopharyngeal swabs tests, he was discharged and transferred to a designated hospital for isolation treatment and rehabilitation therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
