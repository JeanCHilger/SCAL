One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first work systematically implements amplicon and capture approaches in sequencing HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other emerging viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
