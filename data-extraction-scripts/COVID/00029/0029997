In Iran, until March 17, 2020, approximately 14,991 COVID-19 patients were reported. Although modeling and predictions will be typically associated with random error, this study aimed to model and determine the epidemic trend and prediction of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis and mathematical modeling. We used the daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. At the beginning of the outbreak, a delayed (stochastic) dynamic system model was used to calculate basic reproduction number (R0). Epidemic Curve along with patient population growth, recovered and deceased individuals was used to predict the epidemic trend. Epidemic projection models of logistic growth differential equations, Gompertz growth, von Bertalanffy and Cubic Polynomial east squared error (LSE) method were used. Matlab software was used to predict the number of cases until April 3, 2020. Results: In the first week of the epidemic, R0 (the mean number of individuals directly infected by an infectious COVID-19 case through the total infectious period, when introduced to a susceptible population) in Iran was estimated to be 4.7 that has now fallen to below 2. The discovery process of COVID-19 cases in Iran is increasing and is based on public behavior and government interventions. Given the assumptions in Models, and three different scenarios, the prediction of the patients on April 3, 2020 using three growth models of Gompertz and von Bertalanffy and least squared error was estimated at 19,500, 27,000, and 48,830, respectively. The number of recovered individuals was estimated 6540 according to Von model, 11800 according to the Gompertz model, and 21000 according to the curve fitting model with least squared error. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 1707 individuals using the logistic growth model, 3165 ones by Von model and 6300 ones according to the LSE method. Conclusion: The process of controlling the epidemic is tangible. The most ideal scenario is the Gompertz model, but it is hard to fulfill. If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be flat from April 3, 2020 by Von model and new cases are expected to decline from the following Iranian new year. This study suggests that government interventions and people's behaviors determine the persistence of the epidemic and should be addressed with greater responsibility, accountability, rigor, and quality.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
