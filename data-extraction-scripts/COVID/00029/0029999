<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Estimating Spot Prevalence of COVID-19 from Daily Death Data in Italy</TITLE><BODY>COVID-19 like many infectious diseases has a variable severity. Due to limited testing capacity for new virus, the majority of infected showing mild or no symptoms it is likely current prevalence data is an underestimate. We present an estimate of the point prevalence of COVID-19 compared to the number of confirmed case in Italy based on the daily death rate and information about the incubation period, time from symptom onset to death and reported case fatality rate.
