Asymptomatic individuals in the context of COVID-19 are those subjects who are carriers of the virus but display no clinical symptoms. Current evidence reveals that this sub-population is a major contributing factor in the propagation of this disease, while escaping detection by public health surveillance systems. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate a basic reproduction number as high as 26.5. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 25\% per day during this period. The model was applied to every county in the US to give estimates of mild, severe, and critical case severity, and also mortality. These estimates can be considered an upper bound.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
