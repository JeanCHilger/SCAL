<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Assessing the Global Tendency of COVID-19 Outbreak</TITLE><BODY>COVID-19 is now widely spreading around the world as a global pandemic, whereas it had been effecitvely under control in China by March 15. In this report, we estimate the global tendency of COVID-19 and analyze the associated global epidemic risk, given that the status quo is continued without further measures being taken. The results show that the global R_0, excluding China, is estimated to be 2.63 (95% CI: 1.67 - 4.69). Seven countries, including Italy and Republic of Korea, have peak values over 10,000. And the peak arrival time of all these countries is after May 12, 2020 (95 % CI: April 1, 2020 - June 24, 2020). We predict that there are four regional clusters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe and North America. Among them, Western Europe will become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Spain and Italy are estimated to be 232,661 and 108,062, respectively. The total number of peak values in Europe will exceed 703,215 (95% CI: 209,670 - 23,095,507). Above all, if the current policy environment is maintained, the cumulative number of patients worldwide will exceed 892,950 (95% CI: 335,922 - 24,930,386).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
