<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Spatial Visualization of Cluster-Specific COVID-19 Transmission Network in South Korea During the Early Epidemic Phase</TITLE><BODY>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading throughout China and other countries including South Korea. As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Using the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020. Compared to various epidemiological measures such as the basic reproduction number, spatial visualizations of the cluster-specific transmission networks may be more useful to characterize super-spreaders and the spread of the virus especially in the early epidemic phase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
