Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the impact of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. Results: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the mean final size and the peak incidence of local outbreaks of COVID-19, provided delays in contact tracing are small. Conclusions: Integrating antiviral drugs together with contact tracing and quarantine is predicted through this model to be an effective tool for the control of local outbreaks of COVID-19.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
