<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-27</DATELINE><TITLE>A special case of COVID-19 with long duration of viral shedding for 49 days</TITLE><BODY>Prolonged viral shedding is associated with severe status and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
