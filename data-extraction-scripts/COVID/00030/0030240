(Leguminosae), which grows in various warm climates such as the Middle East, Asia, and Southern Europe. It is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs and is referred to as “the father of herbal medicine.” Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) (Fig. 1A), a triterpenoid saponin, is a major component of licorice. It has a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, neuroprotective, and immune effects, among others.[1]. Previous studies indicated that GA produces robust neuroprotection via the modulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, primarily through the ERK signaling pathway and its anti-inflammatory properties against high-mobility group box 1 phosphorylation and the suppression of inflammatory cytokine induction [2-4]. These results were based on pathological models. Although numerous pathways have been implicated in the neuroprotective effects of GA, the molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of GA in preventing age-related immune involution and cognitive disorders, the relationship between immune involution and cognition, and the underlying molecular mechanisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
