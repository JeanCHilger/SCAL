Methods: To collect laboratory characteristics, we searched "PubMed" electronic database with the following keywords: "COVID-19" "2019 novel coronavirus" "laboratory findings" "clinical characteristics". Results: Once the initial searches 493 studies were yielded. After removing duplicates studies 480 studies were remained. The 12 studies obtained from the literature, of which 58.3% (7) of studies were case-control, and 41.7% remaining studies were designed as cross-sectional.
