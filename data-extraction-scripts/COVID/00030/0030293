Risk assessment for such economic restoration is of significance. Here we estimated the probability of COVID-19 resurgence caused by work resuming in typical provinces/cities, and found that such probability is very limited (<5% for all the regions except Beijing). Our work may inform provincial governments to make risk level-based, differentiated control measures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
