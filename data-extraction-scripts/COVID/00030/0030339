<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-30</DATELINE><TITLE>When will the Covid-19 epidemic fade out?</TITLE><BODY>A discrete-time deterministic epidemic model is proposed with the aim of reproducing the behaviour observed in the incidence of real infectious diseases. For this purpose, we analyse a SIRS model under the framework of a small world network formulation. Using this model, we make predictions about the peak of the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy. A Gaussian fit is also performed, to make a similar prediction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
