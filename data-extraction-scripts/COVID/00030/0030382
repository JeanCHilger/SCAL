Effective therapeutic drugs are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis of patients, but currently no such drugs are available. Methods The basic information, complete blood count, coagulation profile, inflammatory cytokines and serum biochemical indicators in 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and 21 without LMWH) were retrospectively analyzed to compare and evaluate the effect of LMWH treatment on disease progression. Findings 42 patients with COVID-19 treated at the hospital between February 1 and March 15, 2020 were selected for the study, of which 21 underwent LMWH treatment (Heparin group), and 21 did not (Control), during hospitalization. The changes in lymphocyte% in patients in the heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different to those in the control group (p=0.011). The changes in D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) levels in the heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different to those in the control group (p=0.002;p=0.035). In the heparin group, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (p=0.006). In addition, the changes in IL-6 levels in the heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different to those in the control group (p=0.031). Interpretation In this study, we found that LMWH can improve the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients, and has anti-inflammatory effects of reducing IL-6 and increasing lymphocyte%, which can be used as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide guidance for subsequent clinical treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
