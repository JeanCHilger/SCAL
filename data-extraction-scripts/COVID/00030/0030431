We contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) from (i) SARS-CoV2, (ii) the related but less virulent OC43 (Singapore COVID-19 strain), and (iii) the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS CoV1. We find that the RBDs of the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 are highly optimized to achieve the strongest possible binding interaction with ACE2 which is consistent with its enhanced pathogenicity. SARS CoV2 RBDs form the most stable complex with ACE2 (64.91%, and 28.07% higher binding scores than SARS CoV1 and OC43, respectively) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. In fact, the spike protein RBDs from SARS-CoV2 out-compete the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 64% in terms of binding affinity (quantified using the Rosetta scoring function). They accomplish this through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased pathogenicity of SARS CoV2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
