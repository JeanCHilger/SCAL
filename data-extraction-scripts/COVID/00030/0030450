Part 1 - Face masks, eye protection and person distancing: systematic review and meta-analysis</TITLE><BODY>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing on interrupting or reducing the spread of respiratory viruses. DESIGN: Update of a systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous review; search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from October 2010 up to 9 March 2020; and forward and backward citation analysis. DATA SELECTION: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials of people of any age, testing the use of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing against standard practice, or a similar physical barrier. Outcomes included any acute respiratory illness and its related consequences. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors independently, in pairs, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a generalised inverse variance method for pooling using a random effects model and reported results with risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. RESULTS: We included 15 (cluster) randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. There was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or laboratory-confirmed influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks compared to no masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI Risk Ratio 0.83 (95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for laboratory-confirmed influenza Risk Ratio 1.02 (95%CI 0.73 to 1.43). Harms was poorly reported and limited to discomfort resulting in lower compliance with wearing. The only trial testing quarantining workers with household ILI contacts found a reduction in ILI cases at work, but an increased risk of quarantined workers to contract influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Despite shortcomings in design and reporting of most trials, we would still recommend healthcare workers use facial masks. We found no evidence of a difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators. The latter are associated with harms such as dehydration, performance impairment and compliance. There is only limited evidence to support effectiveness of quarantine. Based on observational evidence from the previous SARS epidemic, large trials comparing full facial protection with surgical masks need to be carried out. Funding for such trials is critical to adequately inform policy and global pandemic preparedness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
