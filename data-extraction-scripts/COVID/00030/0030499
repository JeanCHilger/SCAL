At the same time, the publicity of all kinds of big data also provides the possibility to explore the impact of media information diffusion on disease transmission. This paper explores the mechanism of the influence of information diffusion on the spread of the novel coronavirus, develops a model of the interaction between information diffusion and disease transmission based on the SIR model, and empirically tests the role and mechanism of information diffusion in the spread of COCID-19 by using econometric method. The result shows that there was a significant negative correlation between the information diffusion and the spread of the novel coronavirus; The result of robust test shows that the spread of both epidemic information and protection information hindered the further spread of the epidemic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
