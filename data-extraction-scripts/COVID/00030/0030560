<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-06</DATELINE><TITLE>A Contribution to the Mathematical Modeling of the Corona/COVID-19 Pandemic</TITLE><BODY>Using data from the Johns Hopkins University and the German Robert-Koch-Institut on the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we discuss the applicability of W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick's SIR model including strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures. The numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being done with a Runge-Kutta integration method of fourth order. While the model put forward here is simple, and the coronavirus disease is complex, we do get some results which could be interesting for politicians and health professionals. In particular, we draw some conclusions about the appropriate point in time at which to commence with lockdown measures based on the rate of new infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
