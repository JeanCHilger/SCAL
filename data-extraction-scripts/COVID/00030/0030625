<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Covid-19 excess deaths in the United States through July 2020</TITLE><BODY>Background: Some have claimed that the number of Covid-19 deaths is not much greater than would be experienced in the usual course of events. We sought to estimate the number of deaths due to Covid-19 in the United States and compare that number to the number of expected deaths in the same time period. Methods: To obtain the number of Covid-19 deaths, we multiplied published infection fatality rates by age by population numbers and assumed infection rates. The number of Covid-19 deaths was compared to the number of deaths using life table mortality rates. Results: A population infection rate of 3.2% will be needed to generate the number of Covid-19 deaths predicted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation during April and May 2020. There would be 71,424 excess deaths over those two months. Under normal conditions it would take 9.2 months to generate 71,424 deaths. Conclusions: During April and May 2020 over 80% of the Covid-19 deaths can be classified as excess deaths. These deaths would normally occur over 9.2 months instead of 2 months.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
