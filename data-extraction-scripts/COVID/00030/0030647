Objective To determine whether saving in reagents for detection of SARS CoV-2 can be accomplished using the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens in a public health laboratory. Design The most efficient specimen pool size was determined using a web-based application. Parameters affecting the optimal pool size of 5 specimens were: prevalence rate of 5%, a lower limit of detection of 1 to 3 RNA copies per microliter, sensitivity and specificity of 100%, two-stage pooling algorithm, and a range of pool sizes of 3 to 10 samples. Experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from each confirmed nasopharyngeal positive patient specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) for a total volume of 250 microliter. Viral RNA was then extracted from each pool and subsequently tested with the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay that was developed by the CDC and used according to the instructions of manufacturer. Setting Studies were conducted in the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory with samples collected from individual patients throughout the state. Participants A total of 21 SARS CoV-2 confirmed positive samples and 84 SARS CoV-2 confirmed negative samples were used to create 21 pools. The positive specimens were selected for Ct values indicating a relatively low amount of viral RNA. The method was then tested on an unselected group of 60 community nasopharyngeal specimens. Results Following extraction and RT-PCR amplification, all 21 pools were characterized as SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected with Ct values within -1 and 5 Ct of the original samples. The analysis of 60 community specimens, grouped in 12-pools, determined that two pools were positive followed by identification of two detected specimens among the 60 tested. This was accomplished with a total of 22 reactions. Conclusion and Relevance Group testing may result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69% when the positive laboratory test rate is 10% or less.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
