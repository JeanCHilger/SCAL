We model the current scenario of closed schools and universities and voluntary home quarantine to show that it is still not enough to protect the health system by explicitly computing the demand for hospital intensive care unit beds. We also show that an urgent intense quarantine might be the only solution to avoid the collapse of the health system and, consequently, to minimize the quantity of deaths. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the relaxation of the already imposed control measures in the next days would be catastrophic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
