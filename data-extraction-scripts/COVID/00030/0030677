The identification of any clinically approved drug that could be repurposed to combat COVID-19 would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures to complement social distancing and isolation protocols. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target for drug interventions, based on results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV) an HIV protease inhibitor, that that can inhibit the Mpro of 2002 SARS-CoV. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved anti-retroviral protease inhibitors that may bind more efficiently to Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and block its replication. Of high interest is atazanavir (ATV) due to its documented bioavailability within the respiratory tract, which motivated our evaluation on its ability to impair SARS-CoV-2 replication through a series of in vitro experiments. A molecular dynamic analysis showed that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with greater strength than LPV and occupied the substrate cleft on the active side of the protease throughout the entire molecular dynamic analysis. In a cell-free protease assay, ATV was determined to block Mpro activity at a concentration of 10 μM. Next, a series of assays with in vitro models of virus infection/replications were performed using three cell types, Vero cells, a human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary human monocytes, which confirmed that ATV could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV). In addition, the virus-induced levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were reduced in the presence of these drugs, which performed better than chloroquine, a compound recognized for its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities. Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
