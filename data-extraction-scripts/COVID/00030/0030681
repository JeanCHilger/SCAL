The COVID-19 pandemic caused more than 800,000 infections and 40,000 deaths by the end of March 2020. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate, are not well estimated, partially because of confounding factors in data collection during a rapidly growing outbreak, such as underreporting, delays in case confirmation and changes in surveillance intensities. METHODS. We developed an inference approach using a mathematical model to control for these confounding factors. We fitted the model to both infection incidence and death count data collected from eight European countries and the US. Public health implications of empirical estimates were examined using simulations. FINDINGS. In all countries, the early epidemic period was characterized by exponential growth with rates between 0.19-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.7 days). However, the proportion of cases that had been detected was low (less than 20% of cases detected) except for Germany (23.1%; CI: 5-85%). With such high epidemic growth rates, moderate intervention efforts will have little impact on the public health outcome; high levels of efforts to achieve greater than 77-86% reduction in transmission are needed, no matter the goal is to slowdown the growth to protect a large fraction of population from infection within 18 months or to reverse the growth all together. INTERPRETATION. The extremely fast spread of COVID-19 in Europe and the US suggest a highly infectious virus with a high R0. Early, strong and comprehensive intervention efforts are necessary, whether the aim is mitigation or containment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
