Tolerance at supra-MIC antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels. Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia displayed significantly higher tolerance than isolates that were readily cleared by fluconazole. Thus, tolerance correlates with the response to fluconazole therapy in patients and may help predict whether infections will respond to fluconazole alone. Similarly, measuring tolerance may provide a useful clinical parameter for choosing appropriate therapeutic strategies to overcome persistent clinical candidemia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
