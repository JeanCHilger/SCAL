Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, under-expression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness, and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
