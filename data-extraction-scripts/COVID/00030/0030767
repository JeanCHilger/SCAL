We identify two key residues in the host recognition protein of bacteriophage Î» that are necessary to exploit a new receptor; both residues repeatedly evolved among homologs from environmental samples. Our results provide evidence for widespread host-shift evolution in nature and a proof of concept for integrating experiments with genomic epidemiology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
