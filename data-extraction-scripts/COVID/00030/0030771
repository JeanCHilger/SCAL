However, the impact of antibiotic use on host cells is understudied. We have identified a novel antiviral effect of commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotics. We show that mucosal application of aminoglycosides increased host resistance to a broad range of viral infections including herpes simplex viruses, influenza A virus and Zika virus. Aminoglycoside treatment also reduced viral replication in primary human cells. This antiviral activity was independent of the microbiota as aminoglycoside treatment protected germ-free mice. Microarray analysis uncovered a marked upregulation of transcripts for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following aminoglycoside application. ISG induction was mediated by TLR3, and required TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-Î² (TRIF), signaling adaptor, and interferon regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, transcription factors that promote ISG expression. XCR1+ dendritic cells, which uniquely express TLR3, were recruited to the vaginal mucosa upon aminoglycoside treatment and were required for ISG induction. These results highlight an unexpected ability of aminoglycoside antibiotics to confer broad antiviral resistance in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
