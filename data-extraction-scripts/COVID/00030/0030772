<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-01-18</DATELINE><TITLE>HCAtk and pyHCA: A Toolkit and Python API for the Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis of Protein Sequences</TITLE><BODY>AbstractMotivation: Detecting protein domains sharing no similarity to known domains, as stored in domain databases, is a challenging problem, particularly for unannotated proteomes, domains emerged recently, fast diverging proteins or domains with intrinsically disordered regions.Results: We developed pyHCA and HCAtk, a python API and standalone tool gathering together improved versions of previously developed methodologies, with new functionalities. The developed tools can be either used from command line or from a python API.Availability: HCAtk and pyHCA are available at https://github.com/T-B-F/pyHCA under the CeCILL-C license.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
