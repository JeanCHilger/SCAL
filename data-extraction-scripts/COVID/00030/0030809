Disease was lethal in 90% of calves receiving colostrum with BNP antibodies. The cause of BNP is not fully understood to date. We revealed a profound difference in immune capacities between BNP dams and non-responders. Significant differences were detectable in response to in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood derived lymphocytes to several mitogens and IL-2. BNP cows regulated their immune proteomes completely different from controls with other immune response master regulators. Since we detected this response pattern also in 22% of cows that were never vaccinated at all, this immune deviant (ID) phenotype is still present in cattle and probably inherited. Immune response pattern of these cows was stable over an observation period of 38 months. Importantly, ID have a significant increased prevalence of mastitis underscoring the clinical importance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
