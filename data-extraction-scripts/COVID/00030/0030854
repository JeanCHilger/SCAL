To determine the genetic underpinnings of multicellularity in the emerging model choanoflagellate S. rosetta, we performed a screen for mutants with defects in multicellular rosette development. In two of the mutants, Jumble and Couscous, single cells failed to develop into orderly rosettes but instead aggregated promiscuously into amorphous clumps of cells. Both mutants mapped to lesions in genes encoding glycosyltransferases and the mutations perturbed glycosylation patterns in the extracellular matrix (ECM). In animals, glycosyltransferases transfer activated sugars to donor molecules and thereby sculpt the polysaccharide-rich ECM, regulate integrin and cadherin activity, and, when disrupted, contribute to tumorigenesis. The finding that glycosyltransferases promote proper rosette development and prevent cell aggregation in S. rosetta suggests a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating development and preventing abnormal tumor-like multicellularity.IMPACT STATEMENTA genetic screen reveals that glycosyltransferases are required for proper rosette development and the prevention of cell clumping in one of the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate S. rosetta.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
