In order to further study the tropism and zoonotic potential of these viruses, we have successfully produced lentiviral pseudotypes bearing both H17 and N10. These pseudotypes were shown to be efficiently neutralized by the broadly-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies CR9114 and FI6. Our studies also confirm previous reports that H17 does not use sialic acid as its cellular receptor, as pseudotypes bearing the H17 envelope glycoprotein are released into the cell supernatant in the absence of neuraminidase. However, we demonstrate that N10 facilitates heterosubtypic (H5 and H7) influenza hemagglutinin-bearing pseudotype release in the absence of another source of neuraminidase, significantly increasing luciferase pseudotype production titres. Despite this, N10 shows no activity in the enzyme-linked lectin assay used for traditional sialidases. These findings suggest that this protein plays an important role in viral egress, but is perhaps involved in further accessory roles in the bat influenza lifecycle that are yet to be discovered. Thus we show the lentiviral pseudotype system is a useful research tool, and amenable for investigation of bat influenza tropism, restriction and sero-epidemiology, without the constraints or safety issues with producing a replication-competent virus, to which the human population is naive.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
