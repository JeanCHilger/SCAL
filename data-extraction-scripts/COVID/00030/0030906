In this study, we present the results obtained after the introduction of the FilmArray respiratory panel in a field Point of care (POC) for the diagnosis of virus and bacteria responsible of respiratory tract infections in Senegal rural area. From February to August 2017, we collected nasal swabs from febrile patients that presented symptoms of respiratory tract infections in three health posts located in Niakhar. Specimens were tested on site by multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), using the FilmArray respiratory panel® that targets 20 pathogens, including 17 virus and 3 bacteria (bioMérieux). Nasal swabs were collected from 113 patients. The median age was 4 years (ranging from 4 months to 60 years) and 51 (45%) were males. The prevalence of respiratory pathogens was 37.5% (12/32) during the dry season and 54.3% (44/81) in the rainy season (p=0.16). The prevalence of respiratory pathogen carriage was higher in children under 5 years of age (38/55, 69.1%). The most prevalent micro-organisms detected were influenza B virus (16/113, 14%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (10/113, 9%), parainfluenzae virus (9/113, 8%), respiratory syncytial virus (8/113, 7%), adenovirus (5/113, 4%), human metapneumovirus (3/113, 3%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (2/113, 2%) and Coronavirus (2/113, 2%). The study has demonstrated that the integration of the FilmArray respiratory panel into a field POC could significantly improve the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
