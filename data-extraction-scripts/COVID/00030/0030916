While the great majority of occurrences of the Programmed -1 Ribosomal Frameshifting (-1 PRF) involve viruses, other mobile elements or retroelements, a dramatic instance of utilized human cellular -1 frameshifting in a non-retroelement derived mRNA has been reported. The mRNA for which -1 frameshifting was claimed due to a stimulatory pseudoknot is that which encodes immune functioning C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the HIV-1 co-receptor. The publication ascribed the importance of the reporter CCR5 mRNA frameshifting directing translating ribosomes to a premature termination codon leading to mRNA destabilization via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway (NMD), rather than creating a C-terminally unique peptide. The same lab estimates that up to 10% of eukaryotic genes may be regulated by this frameshift-NMD mechanism and point to the potential for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating disease by -1 PRF.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
