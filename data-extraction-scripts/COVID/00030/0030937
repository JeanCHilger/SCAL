PTGS is commonly accomplished through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells. While siRNA delivery has been optimized for mammalian systems, it remains a significant challenge for plants due to the plant cell wall. Standard plant siRNA delivery methods (Agrobacterium and viruses) involve coding siRNA into DNA vectors, and are only tractable for certain plant species. Herein, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA, and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotube-induced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation. This study establishes that nanotubes, which are below the size exclusion limit of the plant cell wall, could enable a myriad of plant biotechnology applications that rely on RNA delivery.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
