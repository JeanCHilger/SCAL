We used a set of gRNAs targeting repetitive elements â€“ ranging in target copy number from about 31 to 124,000 per cell. dBEs enabled survival after large-scale base editing, allowing targeted mutations at up to ~13,200 and ~2610 loci in 293T and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), respectively, three orders of magnitude greater than previously recorded. These dBEs can overcome current on-target mutation and toxicity barriers that prevent cell survival after large-scale genome engineering.One Sentence SummaryBase editing with reduced DNA nicking allows for the simultaneous editing of >10,000 loci in human cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
