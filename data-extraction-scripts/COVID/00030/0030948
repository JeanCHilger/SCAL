Here, we measured transcriptional response to acute heat stress in unconditioned cells and in daughters of cells that had been exposed to a single or multiple heat shocks. Tracking RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide at nucleotide-resolution revealed that cells precisely remember their transcriptional identity throughout stress, restoring Pol II distribution at gene bodies and enhancers upon recovery. However, single heat shock primed faster gene-induction in the daughter cells by increasing promoter-proximal Pol II pausing, and accelerating the pause-release. In repeatedly stressed cells, both basal and inducible transcription was refined, and pre-mRNA processing decelerated, which retained transcripts on chromatin and reduced recycling of the transcription machinery. These results mechanistically uncovered how the steps of pause-release and termination maintain transcriptional memory over mitosis.Highlights-Cell type-specific transcription precisely recovers after heat-induced reprogramming-Single heat shock primes genes for accelerated induction over mitotic divisionsviaincreased promoter-proximal Pol II pausing and faster pause-release-Multiple heat shocks refine basal and inducible transcription over mitotic divisions to support survival of the daughter cells-Decelerated termination at active genes reduces recycling of Pol II to heat-activated promoters and enhancers-HSF1 increases the rate of promoter-proximal pause-releaseviadistal and proximal regulatory elements&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
