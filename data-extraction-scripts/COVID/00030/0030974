The availability of genomic data is key to understand viral evolution and dynamics, supporting improved control strategies. Currently, the use of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies, which can be applied both directly to patient samples (shotgun metagenomics) and to PCR amplified viral sequences (targeted metagenomics), is the most informative approach to monitor the viral dissemination and genetic diversity.Despite many advantages, these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data. In addition, the many software solutions available can hamper reproducibility and comparison of results.Here we present DEN-IM, a one-stop, user-friendly, containerised and reproducible workflow for the analysis of DENV sequencing data, both from shotgun and targeted metagenomics approaches. It is able to infer DENV coding sequence (CDS), identify serotype and genotype, and generate a phylogenetic tree. It can easily be run on any UNIX-like system, from local machines to high-performance computing clusters, performing a comprehensive analysis without the requirement of extensive bioinformatics expertise.Using DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two DENV datasets. The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples of varying serotype and genotype, including a spiked sample containing the existing four serotypes. The second dataset consisted of 106 targeted metagenomics samples of DENV 3 genotype III where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity.The DEN-IM workflow, parameters and execution configuration files, and documentation are freely available at https://github.com/B-UMMI/DEN-IM.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
