Here, we surveyed batch electroporation as a delivery tool for single polypeptides and multi-subunit protein assemblies of kinetochores, a spatially confined and well-studied subcellular structures. After electroporation in human cells, recombinant fluorescent Ndc80 and Mis12 multi-subunit complexes displayed native localization, physically interacted with endogenous binding partners, and functionally complemented depleted endogenous counterparts to promote mitotic checkpoint signaling and chromosome segregation. Farnesylation is required for kinetochore localization of the Dynein adaptor Spindly. In cells with chronically inhibited farnesyl transferase activity, in vitro farnesylation and electroporation reconstituted robust kinetochore localization of Spindly. Thus, electroporation is uniquely versatile for delivering synthetic and, as required, chemically modified functional mimics of endogenous proteins, and is therefore a promising tool for chemical and synthetic biology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
