While the CD8 T cell response against neurotropic viruses is well characterized, the identity and function of the antigen presenting cell(s) involved in this process is(are) less well defined. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a novel C57BL/6 H-2Db conditional knockout mouse that expresses an H-2Db transgene in which the transmembrane domain locus is flanked by LoxP sites. We crossed these H-2Db LoxP mice with MHC class I-deficient mice expressing Cre-recombinase under either the CD11c or LysM promoter in order to silence H-2Db restricted antigen presentation predominantly in dendritic cells or macrophages, respectively. Upon challenge with intracranial TMEV infection, we observe that CD11c+ APCs are critical for early priming of CD8 T cells against the immunodominant TMEV peptide VP2121-130 presented in the context of the H-2Db molecule. This stands in stark contrast to later time points post TMEV infection where CD11c+ APCs appear dispensable for the activation of antigen-specific T cells; the functionality of these late-arising antiviral CD8 T cells is reflected in the restoration of viral control at later time points. These late-arising CD8 T cells also retain their capacity to induce blood-brain barrier disruption. In contrast, when H-2Db restricted antigen presentation was selectively silenced in LysM+ APCs there was no overt impact on the priming of Db:VP2121-130 epitope-specific CD8 T cells, although a modest reduction in immune cell entry into the CNS was observed. This work establishes a model system which enables critical dissection of MHC class I restricted antigen presentation to T cells, revealing cell specific and temporal features involved in the generation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Employing this novel system, we established CD11c+ cells as a pivotal driver of acute, but not later-arising, antiviral CD8 T cell responses against the TMEV immunodominant epitope VP2121-130, with functional implications both for T cell-mediated viral control and immunopathology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
