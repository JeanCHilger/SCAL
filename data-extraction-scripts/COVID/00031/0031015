The majority of microglial population relies on Csf1r signaling for survival and maintenance. However, a small subset of microglia in the murine brain can survive without Csf1r signaling, and reestablishes homeostasis after Csf1r signaling returns. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we characterized the heterogeneous microglial populations under Csf1r inhibition, including microglia lacking homeostatic markers and populations with elevated markers of monocytes, granulocytes and dendritic cells. Importantly, Mac2 is distinctively expressed in a subset of Csf1r-independent microglia cells, which were highly proliferative and shared striking similarities with those of microglial progenitors in yolk sac and early embryos. Lineage-tracing revealed that the Mac2+ population is of microglial origin and does not come from periphery monocytes. In non-treated mouse brains, Mac2+ microglia exhibited progenitor transcriptomic signature indistinguishable from those survived csf1r inhibition, supporting Mac2+ progenitor-like cells are present among homeostatic microglia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
