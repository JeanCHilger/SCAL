Because alpha herpesviruses spread along synaptic circuits, and infected neurons exhibit altered electrophysiology and increased spontaneous firing, we hypothesized that alpha herpesviruses use activity-dependent synaptic vesicle-like regulated secretory mechanisms for egress and spread from neurons. To address this hypothesis, we used a compartmentalized primary neuron culture system to measure egress and spread of pseudorabies virus (PRV), pharmacological and optogenetics approaches to modulate neuronal firing activity, and a live-cell fluorescence microscopy assay to directly visualize the exocytosis of individual virus particles from infected neurons. Using tetrodotoxin to silence neuronal activity, we observed no inhibition of virus spread, and using potassium chloride or optogenetics to elevate neuronal activity, we also show no increase in virus spread. Using a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to directly measure virus egress from infected neurons, we observed no association between virus particle exocytosis and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Finally, we observed virus particle exocytosis occurs in association with constitutive secretory Rab GTPases, Rab6a and Rab8a, not Rab proteins that are associated with the Ca2+-regulated secretory pathway in neurons, Rab3a and Rab11a. Therefore, we conclude that alpha herpesvirus egress and spread is independent of neuronal activity and Ca2+ signaling because virus particle exocytosis uses constitutive secretory mechanisms in neurons.Author SummaryAlpha herpesviruses, including important human pathogens Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2, and Varicella-Zoster Virus, are among the very few viruses that naturally infect the nervous system. These viruses cause recurrent herpetic and zosteriform lesions, peripheral neuropathies, and deadly or debilitating central nervous system diseases. Many of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of viral egress and spread remain unknown, particularly in the context of specialized neuronal cell biology. Our results indicate that elevated firing activity of infected neurons is not functionally or mechanistically linked to virus egress and spread; therefore, therapies targeting peripheral neuropathic symptoms, elevated neuronal activity, and synaptic vesicle secretory mechanisms are unlikely to affect virus spread in the nervous system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
