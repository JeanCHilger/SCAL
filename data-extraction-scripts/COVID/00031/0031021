Despite this, precisely how different sources of variation in host traits drive heterogeneity in disease transmission is poorly understood. Here we dissected the sources of variation in pathogen transmission using Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila C Virus as a host-pathogen model system. We found that infected lifespan, viral growth, virus shedding, and viral load at death were all significantly influenced by fly genetic background, sex and female mating status. To understand how variation in each of these traits may generate heterogeneity in disease transmission, we estimated individual transmission potential by integrating data on virus shedding and lifespan alongside previously collected data on social aggregation. We found that âˆ¼15% of between-individual heterogeneity in disease transmission was explained by a significant interaction between genetic and sex-specific variation. We also characterised the amount of variation in viral load, virus shedding, and lifespan following infection that could be explained by genetic background and sex. Amongst the determinants of individual variation in disease transmission these sources of host variation play roles of varying importance, with genetic background generally playing the largest role. Our results highlight the importance of characterising sources of variation in multiple host traits when studying disease transmission at the individual-level.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
