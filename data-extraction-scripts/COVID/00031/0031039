We investigated AstV infection in a free-tailed bat species, Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island. A total of 190 guano samples were collected in a maternity colony during 19 different sampling sessions, between June 2016 and June 2017. Biological material was tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. In total, 15 guano samples (7.9%) tested positive, with high genetic diversity of the partial RdRp gene sequences among positive samples. A phylogenetic analysis further revealed that the detected viruses were genetically related to AstVs reported in reptiles, dogs, and pigs, but did not cluster with AstVs commonly found in bats. Although more investigation need to be conducted to assess the level of infected bats in the studied population, our findings suggest that Reunion free-tailed bats are exposed to AstV, and that cross-species transmission may occur with other hosts sharing the same habitat.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
