While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-γ by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-γ and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33-induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17-mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that altered sensitivity of NK cells to IL-12 in the presence of IL-33 may have important consequences in diseases associated with mixed cytokine milieus, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Graphical Abstract&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
