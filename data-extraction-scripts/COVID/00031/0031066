In this study, we reveal that latent RNase L supports ZIKV replication factory (RF) assembly. Deletion of RNase L induced broader cellular distribution of ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 compared with densely concentrated RFs detected in WT cells. An inactive form of RNase L was sufficient to contain ZIKV genome and dsRNA within a smaller area, which increased levels of viral RNA within RFs as well as infectious ZIKV released from the cell. We used a microtubule stabilization drug to demonstrate that RNase L deletion impaired the cytoskeleton rearrangements that are required for proper generation of RFs. During infection with dengue or West Nile Kunjin viruses, RNase L decreased virus production, suggesting that RNase L proviral function is specific to ZIKV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
