Genetically, it is closely related to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS-COV-2. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex-(MHC) I and 3 MHC-II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-5 to get binding affinity. Therefore, in order to provide a fast immunogenic profile of these epitopes we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that rapid development of vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier.
