Focusing on atypical presentation, arrhythmia is a possible clinical problem. Here, the authors performed a summative analysis on available data to calculate for the expected rate of arrhythmia in novel coronavirus 2019 infection. Available data on 314 cases of novel coronavirus 2019 infections2-4 are summarized and further analyzed. Of those 314 cases, lymphocytopenia is detected in 16 cases. The expected rate is equal to 4.46% (95% confidence interval = 2.67%‚Äê7.44%). Based on this observation, arrhythmia is a possible uncommon clinical presentation of the new disease. However, the exact mechanism of arrhythmia is unknown. Additional study on the exact pathophysiology of arrhythmia in novel coronavirus 2019 infection is interesting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
