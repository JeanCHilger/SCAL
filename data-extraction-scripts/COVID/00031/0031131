<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Clinical strategies for treating pediatric cancer during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection</TITLE><BODY>Since December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, which first appeared in China, has spread to over 20 countries around the world.1 By February 19, 2020, more than 74 000 cases had been confirmed, with more than 2000 deaths, and hundreds of thousands of people are under close medical observation. About 300 children have been diagnosed; however, children with cancer are assumed to be more susceptible to this coronavirus, as thier immune function may be suppressed. The purpose of this letter is to provide suggestions on how to choose a reasonable treatment strategy between epidemic prevention and anticancer therapy under the current epidemic conditions.Due to few cases being diagnosed in pediatrics, most of our suggestions are from existing and previous experiences in adults. These suggestions may be modified after accumulating clinical evidence and experience. Pediatric oncologists should continually update their knowledge on the prevention and control of SARS‐CoV‐2 in children with cancer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
