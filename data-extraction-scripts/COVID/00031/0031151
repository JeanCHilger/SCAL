On January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities confirmed that these cases were associated with a novel coronavirus, which was subsequently named 2019­nCoV by WHO [4]. Previous study [5] reported that virus infection can cause several neurological complications, including polyneuritis, Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS), meningitis, encephalomyelitis, and encephalopathy. We describe a rare case of 2019-CoV infection and acute unilateral isolated oculomotor nerve palsy. In this case, the diagnosis was made based on the chest computed CT manifestations and throat swab sample test. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our department with a 5-day history of persistent diplopia and a droopy left eyelid. During initial hospital assessment, he endorsed limb weakness and poor spirit. He denied any fever, neck stiffness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or photophobia. He had a history of alcohol and tobacco use, type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension (both well controlled by drugs), and lacunar infarction (without sequela).DA - 2020/02/25&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
