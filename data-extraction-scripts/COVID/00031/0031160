However, in addition to the respiratory symptoms, some patients also exhibited not-respiratory symptoms such as kidney failure, which implies that 2019-nCoV could also invade other organs. To construct a risk map of different human organs, here we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets derived from major human physiological systems including respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems. By interrogating the scRNA-seq data, we not only identified the organs such as lung, heart, oesophagus, kidney, bladder and ileum to be risky, but also can locate the specific cell types such as type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of kidney, ileum and oesophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells, which are vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the findings, we finally constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of different organs to 2019-nCoV infection. This study may provide the potential clues for further investigating the pathogenesis and route of 2019-nCoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
