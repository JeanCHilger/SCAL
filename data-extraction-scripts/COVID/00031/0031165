<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Old Weapon for New Enemy: Drug Repurposing for Treatment of Newly Emerging Viral Diseases</TITLE><BODY>In a very recent work by a research team led by Drs. Gengfu Xiao, Wu Zhong and Zhihong Hu, the antiviral efficiency of the FDA-approved drugs including ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine (CQ) and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) and favipiravir (T-705) were evaluated against a clinical isolate of 2019-nCoV in a cell culture infection model (Wang et al.2020). The authors found that two compounds CQ (EC50 value?=?1.13 µmol/L; CC50?>?100 µmol/L, SI?>?88.50) and RDV (EC50?=?0.77 µmol/L; CC50?>?100 µmol/L; SI?>?129.87) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index (SI). From the in vitro results, these two compounds appear promising to be transformed into clinical drugs for treatment of 2019-nCoV infections.AU - Guo, Deyin&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
