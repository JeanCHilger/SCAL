Just how much has the coronavirus spread? More than 137,000 people in 117 countries and regions have been confirmed as having COVID-19. And earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the outbreak as a pandemic. But testing isn’t available to everyone, so the numbers don’t accurately reflect the extent of transmission in communities around the world. Based on conversations with three leaders in public health — at the WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and at one of one of the largest research charities in the world — Nature explains how officials and researchers are attempting to estimate the size of individual outbreaks based on incomplete data.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
