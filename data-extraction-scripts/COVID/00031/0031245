<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Imported Novel Coronavirus Infections: Observation on Active and Passive Case Detection in Thailand</TITLE><BODY>In December 2019, a viral disease – the novel coronavirus – emerged in China and spread widely.1 At present, the disease has already exported to many countries,2 and is becoming an important public health problem. Thailand is a Southeast Asian country that has many international flights connecting to China and there are already imported cases of the disease in Thailand. The first ex-China case of the new disease was detected in Thailand. We would like to share observations on the spread of this disease in Thailand. To date (24 January 2020), there are imported cases of novel coronavirus infections in Thailand. Of these cases, 1 patient is a Thai who returned from tourism activity in China and the others are 4 Chinese tourists. Focusing on disease detection, 4 patients were detected at health screening points at immigration posts at international airports. The Thai patient visited the physician herself after developing a fever upon returning to Thailand. Of interest, during the period of disease outbreak, active screening is done at Thai international airports and 21,374 travelers have already been screened. Active screening can detect 80% of imported cases; 20% are detected passively. Based on these data, it has been demonstrated that active screening at the airport is still a good method for detecting new emerging disease but it cannot provide 100% efficacy in case detection. The health-related self-concern of the patient is also important to help with passive case detection. Therefore, promotion of health knowledge concerning the new disease is very important for the international traveler.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
