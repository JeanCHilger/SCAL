<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Diabetes and COVID-19</TITLE><BODY>We acknowledge the frontline medical staff working day and night in China to rescue critical cases and protect the public health. We know that these great efforts are now and will be in the future crucial in overcoming COVID‐19. Providing care to people with diabetes is an important part of the effort. The Journal of Diabetes was started more than a decade ago in a spirit of collaboration between East and West addressing the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, management, complications, and prevention of diabetes. The journal is issuing a call for submission of commentaries, original articles, and case reports regarding issues with COVID‐19 in patients with diabetes, as well as descriptions of basic aspects of the interrelationships between diabetes and the novel CoV. We hope in this way to support the thousands of Chinese medical workers involving themselves in the care of patients with COVID‐19, and we look forward to these efforts helping our goal of eradication of the disease&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
