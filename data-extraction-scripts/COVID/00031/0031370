Here, the authors used a mathematical modelling theoretical approach to predict the expectedproper dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir for possible treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. The protocol for mathematical modeling in this work is the same as previous report by Wiwanitkit et al[5]. Briefly, the primary agreement was there had to be a specific amount of required energy for reaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and its target enzyme and this energy is a specific constant for the reaction. Based on bonding theory, the required amount of lopinavir/ritonavir was varied to the two substrates, lopinavir/ritonavir and target, protease. Here, the simple equation ‘A + B ? C where A was the target enzyme, B was lopinavir/ritonavir and C was end product’ could be written.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
