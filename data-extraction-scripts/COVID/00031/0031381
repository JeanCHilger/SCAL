Many airline travelers moved between Wuhan and Japan at that time, suggesting that Japan is at high risk of invasion by the virus. Diagnostic systems for 2019-nCoV were developed with urgency. Two nested RT-PCR assays and two real-time RT-PCR assays were adapted to local Japanese conditions. As of 8 February 2020, the assays developed have successfully detected 25 positive cases of infection in Japan.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
