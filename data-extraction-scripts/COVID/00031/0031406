EAU resembles another T cell-mediated autoimmune disease--experimental allergic encephalomyelitis--since both have increased expression of MHC class II molecules in the target tissue, can be adoptively transferred by activated CD4+ T cells and are inhibited by cyclosporin A. The immunological findings will be compared to find out if the same cellular mechanisms are involved in both diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
