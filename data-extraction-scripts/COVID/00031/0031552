<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-09-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Non-Molecular-Clock-Like Evolution following Viral Origins in Homo sapiens</TITLE><BODY>Researchers routinely adopt molecular clock assumptions in conducting sequence analyses to estimate dates for viral origins in humans. We used computational methods to examine the extent to which this practice can result in inaccurate ‘retrodiction.’ Failing to account for dynamic molecular evolution can affect greatly estimating index case dates, resulting in an overestimated age for the SARS-CoV-human infection, for instance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
