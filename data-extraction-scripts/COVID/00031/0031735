Others have demonstrated that the antigen has the ability, in vitro, to specifically bind HDV RNA species. We report a further examination of this phenomenon, using partially purified recombinant protein, expressed as a fusion with the staphylococcal protein A. From Northwestern (RNA-immunoblot) analyses with both complete and various subdomains of HDV genomic and antigenomic RNAs, we found that a necessary feature for specific binding was that the RNA be able to fold to some extent into the so-called rodlike structure; this structure is a predicted intramolecular partial base-pairing of the circular RNA, with about 70% of all bases involved, so as to produce an unbranched rodlike structure. Six different subregions of the HDV rodlike structure, three on the genomic RNA and three on its complement, the antigenomic RNA, were tested and found to be sufficient for antigen binding. However, features in addition to the rodlike structure may also be necessary for specific binding, because we found that a similar structure present in the RNA of the potato spindle tuber viroid did not allow binding.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
