On the basis of reactivities with gp160 at different times after pulse-labeling, the MAbs were sorted into groups that exhibited binding which was immediate and constant, immediate but transient, delayed, late, or very late. This grouping was consistent with the selectivity of the MAbs for structural features of gp160. Thus, a MAb to the V3 loop reacted with envelope proteins at all times, in accord with the relative conformational independence and accessibility of the epitope. Several MAbs that preferentially react with monomeric gp160 exhibited diminished binding after the pulse. A 10-min tag occurred before gp160 reacted with conformational MAbs that inhibited CD4 binding. The availability of epitopes for other conformational MAbs, including some that react equally with monomeric and oligomeric gp160 and some that react better with oligomeric forms, was half-maximal in 30 min and closely followed the kinetics of gp160 oligomerization. Remarkably, there was a 1- to 2-h delay before gp160 reacted with stringent oligomer-specific MAbs. After 4 h, approximately 20% of the gp160 was recognized by these MAbs. Epitopes recognized by monomerspecific or CD4-blocking MAbs but not by oligomer-dependent MAbs were present on gp160 molecules associated with the molecular chaperone BiP/GRP78. MAbs with a preference for monomers reacted with recombinant or HIV-1 envelope proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the oligomer-specific MAbs recognized them in the Golgi complex. Additional information regarding gp160 maturation and intracellular trafficking was obtained by using brefeldin A, dithiothreitol, and a low temperature.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
