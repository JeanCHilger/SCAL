<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-10-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Controlling droplet-transmitted respiratory infections: Best practices and cost</TITLE><BODY>OBJECTIVE: To promote incorporation of new guidelines on control of respiratory infections into family physicians’ practices. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: The World Health Organization website on pandemic influenza, the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan, the Ontario guidelines on respiratory infection control, and research on implementing guidelines into family practice were reviewed. We also researched and calculated what the costs of implementing the guidelines would be. MAIN MESSAGE: Effective control of respiratory infections in physicians’ offices can be achieved by displaying signs in the waiting room, having reception staff give masks to patients with cough and fever, instructing these patients to clean their hands with alcohol gel and to sit at least 1 m from others, inquiring about patients’ or their close contacts’ recent travel, using disinfectant wipes to clean possibly contaminated surfaces in waiting rooms and examining areas, and having staff and care providers wear masks and wash hands or use alcohol gel. The approximate annual cost of incorporating the guidelines is about $800 per physician. CONCLUSION: Because the outbreak of an influenza pandemic is likely imminent, implementing standard guidelines for control of respiratory infections in primary care offices seems wise. Following these guidelines would help prevent patients and staff from contracting serious respiratory illnesses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
