<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013</DATELINE><TITLE>A longitudinal study about the effect of practicing Yan Xin Qigong on medical care cost with medical claims data</TITLE><BODY>We use 7-year longitudinal medical claims data and statistical models to study the relationship between practicing Yan Xin Qigong (YXQG), a traditional advanced Chinese Qigong that has been integrated with modern science and technology, and practitionersâ€™ medical care utilization and the associated costs. We find that for the sampled practitioners, their average monthly medical visits and the associated costs are significantly lower after practicing YXQG. After controlling for other factors, the longer of practicing YXQG, the more likely there was a fall in average medical visits and medical costs. The main findings are robust to various estimation methods.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
