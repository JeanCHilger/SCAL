All the isolates shared the common group antigens of rotaviruses as revealed by immunofluorescence and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. A hemagglutinating activity was demonstrated with human group O, porcine and guinea pig erythrocytes. At least one of the isolates was clearly distinguished from the American prototype of porcine rotavirus (strain OSU) by neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests; a third serotype was also suspected. By polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA, it was not possible to differentiate these isolates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
