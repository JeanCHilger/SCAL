<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-10-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Age-related Deficiencies in Antigen-Specific CD4 T cell Responses: Lessons from Mouse Models</TITLE><BODY>Infectious diseases contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in elderly populations. One of the major contributing factors to this is age-related declines in the immune system that diminish the response o both infections and vaccinations. In order to understand how specific changes in the immune system influence the generation of immunity in older individuals, immunologists have developed aging mouse models that allow for experimental manipulation of immune system components. These models have shown that there are dramatic age-related changes in naive CD4 T cell function that have the potential to impact a myriad of immune responses. In this review, we will summarize these findings on the intrinsic changes in CD4 T cell function and discuss how these changes influence immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
