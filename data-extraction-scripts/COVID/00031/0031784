The antigenic reactivity of the recombinant fusion proteins and their Xa factor cleavage EAV products was confirmed by immunoblot using horse antisera to EAV. Some horse sera, however, showed immune reactivity to the MBP fusion partner protein. Based on a total of 32 horse sera analyzed for the presence of EAV antibodies by immunoblot, using the MBP-N or -M fusion proteins and the Xa factor cleavage EAV products, and in the serum neutralization test, there was 100% concordance between the assays. Sera from horses experimentally infected with EAV were reactive in the immunoblot test with both the MBP-N and the MBP-M fusion proteins by day 14 after EAV exposure. The reactivity continued to the end of the experiment at day 145 after infection. This immune reactivity correlated with the detection of neutralizing antibodies in the serum samples. Based on these findings, the recombinant N and M proteins might be useful for serodetection of EAV-infected animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
