In the first year of the trial, the calves showed clinical signs of copper deficiency. There was improved growth following subcutaneous injection of copper ethylenediamine tetraacetate, and the treated calves had a 2.8% increase in adjusted weaning weights. In the second year of the trial pregnant cows were fed a basal ration of bromegrass silage, barley and minerals over the winter feeding period. The feed was supplemented with copper so that half received 5.5 mg/kg of copper on a dry matter basis and half 40 mg/kg. Calving occurred in the spring and half the calves were treated with injectable copper at birth and again at 12 weeks of age. There was no evidence of copper deficiency in the calves and there was no effect of high level copper supplementation on calf birth weight, or neutrophil candidacidal activity. Susceptibility to diarrhea varied in a complex fashion; morbidity was lowest in calves born to dams fed supplementary copper and highest in calves born to supplemented dams and injected with copper at birth. The cows and calves grazed the same copper deficient pasture over the summer. The average daily gain for calves born to supplemented cows was 0.999 +/- 0.010 kg/day (x +/- SEM) which was significantly greater than the 0.972 +/- 0.009 kg/day for calves from nonsupplemented dams (p = 0.044). The benefit of copper supplementation on 200 day weaning weight was estimated at 4.8 kg. Evidence of copper deficiency was seen when a herd test showed mean serum levels below 9 mumol/L and liver values below 0.09 mmol/kg wet matter.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
