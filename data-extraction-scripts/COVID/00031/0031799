Coronavirus Titer in Tissues of Pigs After Exposure</TITLE><BODY>Coronavirus titers were compared in various tissues of three-day old and 21-day old pigs after exposure to the virus of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). Pigs in both groups that did not die from TGE were necropsied at intervals from one to 15 days post-exposure, and their tissues assayed for viral content. Viral titers were much higher in the small intestines of the younger pigs. Viral isolations were obtained from several tissues of the younger pigs but only from the small intestines of pigs infected at 21 days of age. Levels of viral neutralizing antibodies in the serums of both age groups were comparable at similar post-exposure intervals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
