An ultrastructural investigation was made to search for any unusual microorganisms in the digestive system, lymphatic organs, and blood cells of ponies that had developed clinical signs after transfusion with whole blood from horses naturally infected with Potomac horse fever. A consistent finding was the presence of rickettsial organisms in the wall of the intestinal tract of these ponies. The organisms were found mostly in the wall of the large colon, but fewer organisms were found in the small colon, jejunum, and cecum. The organisms were also detected in cultured blood monocytes. In the intestinal wall, many microorganisms were intracytoplasmic in deep glandular epithelial cells and mast cells. Microorganisms were also found in macrophages migrating between glandular epithelial cells in the lamina propria and submucosa. The microorganisms were round, very pleomorphic, and surrounded by a host membrane. They contained fine strands of DNA and ribosomes and were surrounded by double bileaflet membranes. Their ultrastructure was very similar to that of the genus Ehrlichia, a member of the family Rickettsiaceae. The high frequency of detection of the organism in the wall of the intestinal tract, especially in the large colon, indicates the presence of organotrophism in this organism. Infected blood monocytes may be the vehicle for transmission between organs and between animals. The characteristic severe diarrhea may be induced by the organism directly by impairing epithelial cell functions or indirectly by perturbing infected macrophages and mast cells in the intestinal wall or by both.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
