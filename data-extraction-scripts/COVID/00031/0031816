Because female reproductive hormones have been associated with cardioprotective states, many investigators avoid using female animals because these hormones are cyclical and may introduce experimental variability. In addition, no studies have investigated the specific effects of the estrous cycle on cardiac ischemic injury. This study was conducted to determine whether the estrous cycle stage influences the susceptibility to ischemic injury in rat hearts. Estrous cycle stage was determined by using vaginal smear cytology, after which hearts underwent either in vivo (surgical) or ex vivo (isolated) ischemia–reperfusion injury. For in vivo studies, the left anterior coronary artery was ligated for 25 min of ischemia and subsequently released for 120 min of reperfusion. Infarct sizes were 42% ± 6%; 49% ± 4%; 40% ± 9%; 47% ± 9% of the zone-at-risk for rats in proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus, respectively. For ex vivo studies, isolated, perfused hearts underwent global ischemia and reperfusion for 25 and 120 min, respectively. Similar to our in vivo studies, the ex vivo rat model showed no significant differences in susceptibility to infarction or extent of cardiac arrhythmia according to estrous stage. To our knowledge, these studies provide the first direct evidence that the stage of estrous cycle does not significantly alter cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
