The replicase of the related virus equine arteritis virus contains only one active PCP in the corresponding region. Sequence comparison revealed that the equine arteritis virus PCP alpha counterpart probably was inactivated by loss of its catalytic Cys residue. For both porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, the generation of two processing products, nsp1 alpha and nsp1 beta, was demonstrated by in vitro translation. Site-directed mutagenesis and sequence comparison were used to identify the putative active-site residues of the PCP alpha and PCP beta protease domains and to show that they mediate the nsp1 alpha/1 beta and nsp1 beta/2 cleavages, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
