Antigens from Entamoeba histolytica were adsorbed in wells of disposable polystyrene strips containing 12 flat-bottom wells. After exposure to the serum of a patient and peroxidase-labeled anti-human immunoglobulin G, the rate of color change in specific substrate was determined by eight sequential readings of individual wells over a 2-min period with a microcomputer-controlled model MR-600 automated plate reader. The changes in absorbance readings were converted to slope values for each well by the microcomputer. Thus, 12 samples were read, and results were printed in ca. 3.5 min. Assay conditions are described and data are presented to show that this assay is quantitative for antibody and antigen concentration with a single-tube (well) dilution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
