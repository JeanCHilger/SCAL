Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. W. Dieffenbach, C. B. Cardellichio, A.A. Basile, P.E. Elia, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:1716-1720, 1993). A recombinant protein with only the anchored N-terminal domain was not a functional receptor, but a recombinant protein with the N-terminal domain of MHVR linked to the second and third immunoglobulin-like domains and anchor from the mouse poliovirus receptor homolog, mph, was a functional receptor for mouse hepatitis virus. The native four-domain MHVR has 16 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, including three on the N-terminal domain. Recombinant proteins lacking each one of these three sites or all three of them were functional receptors. Thus, glycosylation of the N-terminal domain is not required, but a glycoprotein longer than the N-terminal domain is required for virus receptor activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
