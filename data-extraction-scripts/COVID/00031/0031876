<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1989-07-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Health and metabolic responses of young calves housed at -30 degrees C to -8 degrees C.</TITLE><BODY>Newborn, male, Holstein calves, were continuously housed for three weeks in calf hutches at 17 degrees C or in a thermal environment which varied rhythmically on a daily basis either between -20 degrees C and -8 degrees C (experiment A) or between -30 degrees C and -18 degrees C (experiment B). Compared to warm-housed calves, cold-housed calves in experiment A had metabolic rates which were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in a standing position but which were not significantly different (p less than 0.05) in a recumbent position. Recumbent and standing cold-housed calves in experiment B had an increased (p less than 0.05) metabolic rate compared to warm-housed controls. Heat loss was less (p less than 0.05) for recumbent cold-housed calves in experiment B than for standing calves in a thermoneutral environment. Localized subcutaneous hemorrhages of hindlimbs were a consistent necropsy finding among all cold-housed calves. Average daily gains of cold-housed calves were not significantly different from warm-housed controls. Clinical, physiological and pathological findings indicated that cold treatments used in the present study did not cause serious harm to calves. It was concluded that calves housed in properly managed hutches are remarkably cold tolerant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
