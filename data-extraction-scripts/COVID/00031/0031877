Infection of insect cells with the recombinant virus resulted in the production of a 120-kilodalton disulfide-linked dimeric form of the BCV HE polypeptide. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain from the HE polypeptide resulted in secretion of a dimeric form of the truncated HE polypeptide. The acetylesterase activity of the BCV HE was detectable in insect cells expressing the BCV hemagglutinin and was inhibited by two monoclonal antibodies which also inhibit hemagglutination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
