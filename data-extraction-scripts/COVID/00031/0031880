Although normal reference values for many rodent species have been published, there is a dearth of similar information for the genus Microtus. In addition, most studies use a mean and standard deviation to establish reference intervals, but doing so is not the recommendation of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards) or the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. The purpose of this study was to establish normal reference parameters for plasma biochemistry and hematology in mature pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) by using the nonparametric rank percentile method as recommended by the 2 laboratory medicine organizations mentioned. Samples of cardiac blood from a closed colony of pine voles were collected at euthanasia and evaluated under rodent settings on 2 automated hematology analyzers from 2 different manufacturers and on the same type of automated biochemistry analyzer. There were no sex-associated clinically significant differences between the sexes; younger animals had a lower hematocrit, higher mean corpuscular volume, and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration than did older animals. Only platelet counts differed when comparing hematologic values from different analyzers. Relative to rats and mice, pine voles have a lower mean corpuscular volume and higher red blood cell count, higher blood urea nitrogen, much higher alanine aminotransferase, and lower glucose and phosphorous concentrations. Hematology and plasma biochemical results obtained in this study are considered representative for healthy adult laboratory pine voles under similar environmental conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
