A 740-bp fragment that originated from the conserved region of the viral genome was partially sequenced. From this sequence, four PCR primers and one oligonucleotide probe were designed and synthesized. A specific 640-bp PCR product was amplified by using oligonucleotides 1 and 5 as primers and extracts of the following samples as templates: organs and plasma obtained from ASFV-infected pigs, ASFV-infected cell cultures, and cloned DNA fragments containing the same conserved genomic region as that in the original 740-bp clone. No specific reaction products were observed in the corresponding controls. The identities of the PCR products were confirmed either by a second amplification with nested primers or by hybridization with a specific, biotinylated oligonucleotide probe. PCR proved to be a quicker and more sensitive method than virus isolation followed by the hemadsorption test when spleen and plasma samples from experimentally ASFV-infected pigs were tested. Furthermore, cloned virus DNA could be used as a positive control in the place of a live virus control. This is advantageous whenever the use of live virus is undesirable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
