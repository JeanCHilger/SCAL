The frameshift region consists of two UAA termination codons, two repeats of four identical bases between the terminators, and a stem-loop structure that has the potential to form a pseudoknot located downstream from the second UAA. The stem-loop and pseudoknot are features found in a number of retroviruses where frameshifting is a more common occurrence. The terminators, sequence repeats, and secondary structures were identified in both the P. loescheii plaA gene and the mRNA transcript. An in-frame fusion of the entire plaA frameshift region between codons 9 and 10 of the lacZ gene permitted relatively efficient expression (4 to 25% of that of the control) of beta-galactosidase in Escherichia coli.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
