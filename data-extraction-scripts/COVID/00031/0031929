Procedures were developed for normalization and standardization of kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results through incorporation of five different control sera of predetermined ("expected") titer in daily runs. When used with such sera and with computer assistance, the kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay minimized both within-run and between-run variability while allowing also for efficient data reduction and statistical analysis and reporting of results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
