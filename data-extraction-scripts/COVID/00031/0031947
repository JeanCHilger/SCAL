<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1986-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Immunological Comparisons of Nitrate Reductase of Different Plant Species Using Monoclonal Antibodies</TITLE><BODY>Six monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of maize leaf nitrate reductase were used to compare plant nitrate reductases in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and enzyme activity inhibition tests. The number of cross-reacting antibodies was shown to vary with species according to phylogenetic classification, ranging from five (sugarcane) to one (dicotyledonous species). Cross-reactions were restricted to higher plant nitrate reductases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
