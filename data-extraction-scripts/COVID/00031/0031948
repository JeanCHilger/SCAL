<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1975-02-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Use of electron microscopy for detection of viral and other microbial contaminants in bovine sera.</TITLE><BODY>A total of 25 lots of bovine serum samples were pelleted in Beem capsules for thin sectioning and were examined by electron microscopy. These included 17 lots of fetal bovine serum pools and five lots of calf serum pools obtained from commercial sources, and three lots of adult bovine serum from local dairy farms. Virus-like particles, 50 to 300 nm in diameter, were detected in 17 of 25 (68%) of the sera. Five of 25 serum samples showed the presence of mycoplasma-like agents. Incubation of bovine serum at 35 C for 1 or 2 weeks appeared to destroy some of these agents, but in certain instances it enhanced bacteria and bacteriophage contaminants. The advantages of electron microscopy using the thin-sectioning technique for detection of microbial contamination in bovine sera are illustrated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
