In plaque reduction assays, WIN 51711 reduced plaque formation by 9 enteroviruses and 33 rhinoviruses, with MICs of 0.004 to 0.17 and 0.004 to 6.2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Addition of WIN 51711 to infected cells at concentrations of 0.02 to 5.0 micrograms/ml reduced the yield of picornaviruses by 90%. Other RNA viruses (nonpicornaviruses) and DNA viruses were unaffected by the compound.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
