<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1999-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>A questionnaire on the health, management, and performance of cow-calf herds in Québec.</TITLE><BODY>Questionnaires were mailed to 520 cow-calf producers in Québec in order to compare management practices and herd performance according to herd size (small: < 40 females, or large: > or = 40 females) and in 4 geographic areas for the 1995 calving season. Owners of large herds adopted management practice and preventive measures more often than did owners of small herds. Average calving and weaning rates were 95% and 87% respectively. Average perinatal and preweaning mortality rates were between 4.9% and 5.6%. A greater percentage of owners with large herds than owners of small herds reported diarrhea and pneumonia problems. Among large herds, the number of herds experiencing pneumonia and calf mortality associated with diarrhea tended to be higher in areas of the northwest. Calf mortality due to pneumonia was higher in the northeast. No regional variation was found among small herds. Further research is needed to identify diseases risk factors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
