SJL/J mice, which are highly resistant to MHV-A59, were previously shown to lack detectable levels of receptor by using either solid-phase virus receptor assays or binding of a monoclonal anti-receptor antibody (MAb) which blocks infection of MHV-susceptible mouse cells. This MAb was used for affinity purification of the receptor glycoprotein from livers of MHV-susceptible Swiss Webster mice. The MHV receptor and an antigenically related protein of 48 to 58 kDa were copurified and then separated by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first 15 amino acids of the receptor were sequenced, and a synthetic peptide of this amino acid sequence was prepared. Rabbit antiserum made against this peptide bound to the MHV receptor glycoprotein and the 48- to 58-kDa protein from livers of MHV-susceptible BALB/c mice and Swiss Webster mice and from the intestinal brush border of BALB/c mice. In immunoblots of intestinal brush border and hepatocyte membranes of MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, the antibody against the amino terminus of the receptor identified proteins that are 5 to 10 kDa smaller than the MHV receptor and the 48- to 58-kDa related protein from Swiss Webster or BALB/c mice. Thus, SJL/J mice express a protein which shares some sequence homology with the MHV receptor but which lacks virus-binding activity and is not recognized by the blocking anti-receptor MAb. These results suggest that resistance of SJL/J mice to MHV-A59 may be due to absence or mutation of the virus-binding domain in the nonfunctional receptor homolog in SJL/J mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
