The inhibitory activity acts in a species-specific manner. As a consequence, the isolation of foamy viruses from blood lymphocytes of infected humans is accelerated in a heterologous coculture system. Antibodies against gamma interferon (IFN-γ) are able to suppress most of the inhibitory activity, suggesting that IFN-γ is the dominant component.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
