Purified preparations of E2 were isolated by solubilization of the viral membrane with nonion detergent Nonidet P-40, followed by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. ELISA optical density values with E2 antigen significantly exceeded the indices when other TGEV protein or intact virion antigen was used. It was shown that a virus protein concentration in the E2 preparation of 500 ng per well is sufficient to sensitize the solid phase of microplates. A comparison of the ELISA and the virus neutralization test for the detection of TGEV antibodies was conducted. A significant correlation between the ELISA and the virus neutralization test was shown (r = 0.97). This serological test may be successfully used for various immunologic investigations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
