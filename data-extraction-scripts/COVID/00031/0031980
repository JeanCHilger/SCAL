Both types of cells produced detectable levels of nitric oxide after poliovirus infection. However, this production was not sufficient to limit viral productivity. On the other hand, pretreatment with the nitric oxide donor glycerine trinitrate lengthened the course of poliovirus infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
