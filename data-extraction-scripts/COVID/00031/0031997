In this study, ten children were surveyed from their enrollment at the nursery, weekly specimens of faeces being collected over a period of 1 year. A total of 459 samples were obtained. In addition four of these children were also followed-up from their first week of life to their enrollment at the nursery, 79 samples being collected during this period. Viruses were detected in a high percentage (44.4%) of these stools, including strains of oral vaccine polioviruses together with viruses isolated in routine cell cultures and by electron microscopy (EM). These viruses were detected in both healthy and ill babies. The possible association between viruses isolated in cell cultures or detected by EM and illness was examined and the results show that the asymptomatic excretion of viruses is frequent, particularly in children within this age group.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
