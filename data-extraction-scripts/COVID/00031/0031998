This was attributed to a decreased rate of virus propagation and spreading in the bodies of the infected animals. The highest virus levels were detected in the tissues of piglets maintained at 8 to 12 C. In contrast, no virus was recovered from piglets maintained at 35 to 37.5 C. The virus was found only in the lymph nodes and respiratory organs in the piglets maintained at 20 to 23 C.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
