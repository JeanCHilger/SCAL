<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-10-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Detecting viruses by using salivary diagnostics</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Diagnostics that involve the use of oral fluids have become increasingly available commercially in recent years and are of particular interest because of their relative ease of use, low cost and noninvasive collection of oral fluid for testing. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors discuss the use of salivary diagnostics for virus detection with an emphasis on rapid detection of infection by using point-of-care devices. In particular, they review salivary diagnostics for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus and human papillomavirus. Oral mucosal transudate contains secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A, as well as IgM and IgG, which makes it a good source for immunodiagnostic-based devices. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Because patients often visit a dentist more regularly than they do a physician, there is increased discussion in the dental community regarding the need for practitioners to be aware of salivary diagnostics and to be willing and able to administer these tests to their patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
