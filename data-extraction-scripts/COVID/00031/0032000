A high prevalence of antibody to murine hepatitis virus was found by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in colonies with a low prevalence of complement-fixing antibodies. Murine hepatitis virus strain A59 was found to be broadly reactive as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antigen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
