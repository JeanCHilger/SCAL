<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-04-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Vaccine usage in western Canadian cow-calf herds</TITLE><BODY>The aims of this study were to describe when and how vaccines are administered during the production cycle in cow-calf herds in western Canada, as well as the factors that influence vaccine usage as reported by producers. The most commonly used vaccines were bovine viral diarrhea virus/infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (BVDV/IBR) in adult animals and clostridial vaccines in calves. While there has been improvement in usage of reproductive and respiratory viral vaccines since previous studies, there are still several areas in which uptake could be improved. Only 72% of herd owners vaccinated their bulls for at least 1 disease. Not all producers are vaccinating their calves for clostridial diseases, and 15% of producers did not vaccinate their calves for respiratory disease before weaning. One goal of increasing vaccine use is to obtain better infection prevention and control and decrease antimicrobial use in cow-calf herds. Two areas in which antimicrobials are commonly used, but vaccine uptake is limited, are foot rot in adult cows and diarrhea in calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
