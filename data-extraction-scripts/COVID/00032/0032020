The optimal conditions for HAD included the incubation of cell cultures at 37C for 3 days after virus inoculation, the use of a 0.4% suspension of goose erythrocytes in phosphate buffer adjusted at pH 6.2, and adsorption of erythrocytes at 4C. This phenomenon was inhibited with anti-rabies serum. Virus titer obtained with the HAD technique was almost the same as with the fluorescent antibody technique or the intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice. Results of the neutralization test by using the HAD technique could be easily determined 3 days after inoculation of chicken embryo cells with the mixture of 100 mean tissue culture infective doses of virus and diluted serum. The neutralizing antibody titers coincided with those obtained in mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
