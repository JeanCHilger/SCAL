<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1991-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to the 41-kilodalton protein of porcine group C rotavirus with homologous and heterologous rotavirus serogroups in immunofluorescence tests.</TITLE><BODY>Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to porcine group C rotavirus immunoprecipitated the major inner capsid protein (41 kDa) but failed to precipitate group A rotavirus proteins. In immunofluorescence tests of rotavirus-infected cell cultures or pig intestines, the MAbs recognized porcine and bovine group C rotaviruses but not group A or B rotaviruses. These MAbs may recognize the group C rotavirus counterpart to VP6 of group A rotaviruses and may be useful as diagnostic reagents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
