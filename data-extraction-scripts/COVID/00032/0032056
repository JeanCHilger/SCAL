Like multiple sclerosis, there are genetic risk factors in disease development, including genes associated with the major histocompatibility complex and with those encoding the beta chain of the T-cell receptor. Comparisons of the susceptible DBA/2 and resistant C57BL/6 strains have indicated an important role for the H-2D locus and for a non-H-2 gene (not involving the beta chain of the T-cell receptor) in differential susceptibility. In the present report, analysis of recombinant-inbred strains (BXD) between the DBA/2 and C57BL/6 strains indicated that this non-H-2 locus is located at the centromeric end of chromosome 3 near (4 +/- 4 centimorgans) the carbonic anhydrase-2 (Car-2) enzyme locus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
