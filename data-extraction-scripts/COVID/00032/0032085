The most sensitive virus to both types of interferon was vesicular stomatitis. A porcine isolate of bovine herpesvirus type 1, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and porcine enterovirus types 1 and 2 were also highly sensitive to interferon-alpha. There was little reduction in the yield of porcine parvovirus or porcine rotavirus, while swinepox, swine influenza and transmissible gastroenteritis viruses were intermediate in their sensitivity to interferon-alpha. In addition to vesicular stomatitis virus, porcine adenovirus type 3, swine influenza, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis and porcine rotavirus were highly sensitive to interferon-beta, while swinepox, bovine herpesvirus type 1, porcine parvovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis and porcine enteroviruses were less sensitive than the above viruses to interferon-beta, although all showed significant reductions in virus yield.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
