B2 reacts with a trypsin-sensitive cell surface epitope. B2 does not neutralize infection of herpes simplex virus, suggesting that the B2-reactive epitope is specifically involved in vaccinia virus entry. A survey of 12 different cell lines reveals a correlation between B2 reactivity and susceptibility to vaccinia virus infection. In addition, B2 interferes with vaccinia virus adsorption to target cells. Taken together, the B2-reactive epitope is part of a receptor that appears important for vaccinia virus entry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
