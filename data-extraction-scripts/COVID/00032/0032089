Mutants have been isolated that dramatically enhance the production of demyelinating disease over that previously noted with the wild-type virus. This reproducible model should now make possible the precise elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism and molecular basis of this virus-induced demyelination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
