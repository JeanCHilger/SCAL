Adjacent to the 3' poly(A) tract, we identified a 76-nucleotide noncoding region preceded by two overlapping reading frames (ORFs). The ultimate 3' ORF of the viral genome encodes the capsid protein, and the penultimate ORF encodes the smallest SHFV envelope protein. These two ORFs overlap each other by 26 nucleotides. Northern (RNA) blot hybridization analyses of cytoplasmic RNA extracts from SHFV-infected MA-104 cells with gene-specific probes revealed the presence of full-length genomic RNA as well as six subgenomic SHFV-specific mRNA species. The subgenomic mRNAs are 3' coterminal. In its virion morphology and size, genome structure and length, and replication strategy, SHFV is most similar to lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, equine arteritis virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
