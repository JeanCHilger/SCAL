The possibility of using CS31A as a carrier of foreign antigenic determinants was investigated. Introduction of heterologous viral epitopes into the CS31A major subunit, ClpG, was successfully performed in the V3 region of the molecule which encodes for an immunodominant linear epitope. E. coli K-12 strains producing the hybrid CS31A molecules or the purified chimeric proteins were used for mice immunization. By using the C epitope derived from the S protein of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, significant antiviral antibody titers were elicited and seroneutralization of the virus was demonstrated, confirming that the molecular environment in V3 is favorable for antigen presentation. These results indicate that synthesis of CS31A hybrid proteins by the wild-type strain 31A could become a powerful tool for the development of oral vaccines directed against mucosal pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
