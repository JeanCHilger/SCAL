However there are interruption/decrease of cascade reaction and cytolytic effects in complement system. This study detected CRP, CH50, C3 and C4 levels in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and compare with the imbalance of complement associated gene mRNA expression in PE patients. There was significant increase of CH50 in acute VTE patients. Even though CH50 increased significantly in acute VTE patients and had a relatively high sensitivity, cytolytic effects of complements might decrease, based on the genomics results of complement cascade reactions imbalance/interruption and increased total complements in VTE patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
