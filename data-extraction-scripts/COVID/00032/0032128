SHS isolates from Spain and Canada were polymorphic at 14 loci and were classified into 19 multilocus genotypes, defining clones that differed on average at 34% of the loci. In most cases, SHS isolates of different clonal genotypes were distinct in O:H serotype and expressed different fimbrial antigens. Comparisons with 93 isolates obtained from birds with colibacillosis revealed enzyme polymorphisms at 17 of 20 loci, with an average of 3.5 alleles per locus. In the total sample, 56 clonal genotypes were distinguished, with 27 (23%) of the isolates belonging to one of three common clones. Both SHS and colibacillosis isolates were genetically diverse, with an average single-locus diversity of 0.36, indicating that a wide variety of naturally occurring bacterial clones is associated with these acute avian infections. Six previously defined groups of clones identified in diseased birds from the United States were represented in isolates from Spain, indicating that similar clones occur in widely separated geographic areas. In addition, one group of SHS isolates was closely related to a recognized widespread clone complex incriminated in human septicemia and meningitis. The results suggest that certain strains implicated in SHS infections belong to a clone complex whose members have special attributes that promote involvement in invasive diseases in humans and animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
