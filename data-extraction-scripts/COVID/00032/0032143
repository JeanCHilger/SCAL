To address this, 18, 2-month-old Angus-cross passively immune beef heifer calves that had been primed at birth with a combination viral intranasal vaccine were administered either a parenteral combination vaccine containing modified-live (MLV) BRSV or a similar vaccine containing inactivated BRSV. At 6 months of age, these calves and 2 controls that received only the MLV at 2 months of age were challenged with BRSV via aerosol. Two calves, 1 control, and 1 MLV-boosted, developed severe respiratory disease and required euthanasia; the remaining calves developed no or mild respiratory disease and recovered. Calves that received the inactivated booster had significantly higher arterial oxygen concentrations on Day 7 after challenge and had anamnestic BRSV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies after challenge; the MLV-boosted calves did not. These data suggest that adjuvanted inactivated parenteral BRSV vaccines administered at 2 months of age may provide better boosting for neonatally mucosally primed calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
