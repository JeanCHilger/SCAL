We present a rationale for the order of appearance of these molecules and show, using competition assays, that either segment duplication or single nucleotide insertion can enhance DI RNA competitiveness. Possible mechanisms for the introduction of the modifications observed in these DI RNAs are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
