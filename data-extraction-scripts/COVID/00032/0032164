Western immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation assays suggested that all the MAbs recognize conformational epitopes on the virion surface. An EV-70-neutralizing antibody, MAb/ev-12 (MAb1), was selected for the production of MAb2s. Five MAb2s were selected for their capacities to inhibit the interaction of MAb/ev-12 with EV-70 in dot immunobinding inhibition and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, these five MAb2s inhibited virus neutralization mediated by MAb/ev-12, suggesting that they recognize paratope-associated idiotopes. In competition enzyme immunosorbent assays, none of the five MAb2s recognized other neutralizing and nonneutralizing EV-70-specific MAbs, demonstrating that the MAb2s were specific for private idiotopes. Immunization with each of the MAb2s was carried out for the production of anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3). All five MAb2s induced an immune response. Moreover, results suggested that they share idiotopes, since MAb2-MAb/ev-12 binding could be inhibited by homologous as well as heterologous Ab3s. Ab3 sera were shown to possess antibodies capable of immunoprecipitating 35S-labeled viral proteins in the same manner as MAb/ev-12. Nine of 15 mice immunized with MAb2s demonstrated Ab3 neutralizing activity specific for the prototype EV-70 strain, J670/71. The potential application of MAb2s to serve as surrogate immunogens for conformational epitopes is substantiated by the results presented in this report.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
