Data were collected for 247 children 60 months of age and under between July 1984 and February 1985 in 10 villages that had an improved water supply at least one year prior to investigation. Children whose families relied exclusively on the new water supply for their drinking and cooking needs grew 0.438 cm and 235 g more in six months than children whose families supplemented the new water supply with the use of contaminated traditional water for drinking and cooking. The difference in growth was greater among children over 12 months of age at the start of the evaluation than among infants. This may be explained partly by lower rates for Giardia lamblia, the most commonly identified pathogen in stools in older children. Among infants, similar rates of Campylobacter, the most commonly isolated pathogen among infants, may have prevented larger differences. Results suggest that improved drinking water supplies can benefit preschool children's health after infancy, but only if they are functioning and utilized exclusively for drinking and cooking purposes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
