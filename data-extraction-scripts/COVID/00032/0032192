Strain A/J mice were inoculated intranasally with MHV type 3. Sera were collected at 1, 2, 4, and 9 weeks postinoculation and tested. Individual serum samples were retested twice by each method. The results suggested that the Track XI system was more sensitive and reliable than the Bio-EnzaBead assay in detecting antibody to MHV type 3 in individual serum samples from A/J mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
