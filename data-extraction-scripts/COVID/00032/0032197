Following intracerebral inoculation, the virus spread rapidly to specific areas of the CNS. There were, however, specific structures in which infection was consistently undetectable. Virus spread both between adjacent cell bodies and along neuronal pathways. The distribution of the infection was dependent on the site of inoculation. The majority of viral RNA-positive cells were neurons. Many astrocytes were also positive. Infection of both of these cell types was lytic. In contrast, viral RNA-positive oligodendrocytes were rare and were observed only in well-established areas of infection. The majority of oligodendrocytes in these areas were viral RNA negative and were often the major cell type remaining; however, occasional destruction of these cells was observed. No differences in any of the above parameters were observed between CBA and BALB/c mice, susceptible and resistant, respectively, to chronic CNS demyelinating infection with TO strains of Theiler's virus. By using Southern blot hybridization to detect reverse-transcribed PCR-amplified viral RNA sequences, no virus persistence could be detected in the CNS of immunized mice surviving infection with GDVII. In conclusion, the GDVII strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus cannot persist in the CNS, but this is not consequent upon an inability to infect glial cells, including oligodendrocytes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
