Thirty-eight (48%) of the samples were positive by electron microscopy, 59% by immunodiffusion and 20% positive by fluorescent antibody technique analyses. Another 9% were suspect-positive by fluorescent antibody technique. Chymotrypsin treatment of the fecal samples increased the ease of observing the viral particles by electron microscopy and also intensified the immunodiffusion arcs obtained. Immunodiffusion analyses using specific antisera to the virus would appear to be a practical method of detecting rotavirus in diarrheic fecal samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
