The meeting was followed by an informal consultation convened by WHO to consider the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to vaccine design and production. The needs for further research and the potential role of WHO in coordinating and encouraging international activities in this area were discussed. This report summarizes the proceedings of the scientific workshop and the recommendations made by the WHO consultation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
