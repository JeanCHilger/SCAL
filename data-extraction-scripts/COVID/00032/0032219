<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1986-04-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Infection with Cryptosporidium spp. in humans and cattle in Manitoba.</TITLE><BODY>Between October 1, 1983 and October 31, 1984, fecal specimens from 3656 persons with enteritis and 182 calves, representing 148 herds having a neonatal diarrhea problem, were examined for oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. Oocysts were found in 1% of human and 25% of bovine specimens. All infected persons were immunocompetent. Children under five years of age had an infection rate of 25/100,000 compared to 1.4/100,000 in older people (p less than 0.005). Rates in northern communities were four to seven times as high as those in southern Manitoba. Human infections occurred most commonly in late summer and fall. In beef calves infection occurred in winter and spring, the calving season in Manitoba. Epidemiological association between the infection in people and in cattle could not be established.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
