Blood flow to the liver is known to shift after a meal in rats, perhaps explaining anesthetic variability among rats with variable prandial status. The current study tested the hypothesis that a short period of fasting (3 h) prior to induction with intraperitoneal KX anesthesia would provide a shorter time to recumbency, a longer total sleep time, and a more consistent loss of toe pinch response than would fed rats. Two groups of male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in blinded, crossover experiments. KX anesthesia was administered at 2 different doses (50 mg/kg–5 mg/kg and 70 mg/kg–7 mg/kg) after ad libitum feeding or a 3-h fast. There were no significant differences between groups in induction time, total sleep time, or loss of toe pinch response. We conclude that fasting rats for 3 h prior to KX intraperitoneal anesthesia does not affect induction time, total sleep time, loss of toe pinch response or reduce KX anesthetic variability in male Sprague–Dawley rats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
