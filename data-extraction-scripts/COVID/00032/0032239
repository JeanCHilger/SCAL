ORF 1b is located downstream of, and overlaps, 1a, and it has been suggested on the basis of sequence analysis that expression of ORF 1b is mediated through -1 ribosomal frameshifting. To examine this possibility, a cDNA fragment containing the 1a-1b overlap region was cloned within a reporter gene and placed under the control of the bacteriophage SP6 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Synthetic transcripts derived from this plasmid, when translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system, specified the synthesis of polypeptides whose size and antibody reactivity were consistent with an efficient -1 ribosomal frameshift event at the overlap region. The HAst-1 frameshift signal has two essential components, a heptanucleotide slippery sequence, A6C, and a stem-loop structure in the RNA. The presence of this structure was confirmed by complementary and compensatory mutation analysis and by direct structure probing with single- and double-stranded RNA-specific reagents. The HAst-1 frameshift signal, like that present at the overlap of the gag and pro genes of the retrovirus human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type II, does not involve the formation of an RNA pseudoknot.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
