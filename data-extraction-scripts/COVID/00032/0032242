RNA was extracted from stool samples, throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and plasma with a commercial phenol-guanidinium-chloroform reagent and purified on a polysulfone membrane, on which the reverse transcriptase reaction was also done. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers from the 5' noncoding region of picornaviruses were selected for DNA amplification of 153-bp (enterovirus) and 120-bp (rhinovirus) regions. Double-stranded amplicons were digested into single strands with T7 gene 6 exonuclease and quantitated by an assay using a europium-labeled probe, streptavidin- and biotinylated probe-coated microtitration wells, and time-resolved fluorometry. The sensitivity of the assay was about one template molecule when purified coxsackievirus A9 RNA was used. All enterovirus prototype strains, except echoviruses 22 and 23, and clinical isolates grown in cell culture or suckling mice were strongly positive by the enterovirus PCR-hybridization, as were selected prototype strains and untyped isolates of rhinoviruses by the rhinovirus PCR-hybridization. In a series of 100 clinical specimens tested, the results for 92 agreed with virus culture results. The detection method described will be useful in etiopathogenic studies on enteroviruses and rhinoviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
