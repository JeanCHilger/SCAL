<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2000-03-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Cocaine Causes Increased Type I Interferon Secretion by both L929 Cells and Murine Macrophages</TITLE><BODY>Cocaine has been demonstrated to have a number of different effects on immune cell functions. We have reported alterations of cellular functions by macrophages (Mφ) exposed to cocaine in vitro, including the inhibition of mouse hepatitis virus replication. Here, we present evidence that cocaine stimulates the secretion of an antiviral product that is neutralized by anti-interferon (anti-IFN). A dose-dependent increase in the secretion of IFN by both Mφ and L929 cells incubated with cocaine, with a concomitant decrease in virus replication, is also reported. The increase in IFN secretion was most pronounced when cells were cultured in the presence of the IFN inducer poly(I·C). The effect of cocaine on IFN production was found to be primarily at the transcript level in both Mφ and L929 cells. These findings further support our previous research demonstrating an antiviral activity of cocaine in vitro. The relevance of this activity to viral infections in general remains to be determined.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
