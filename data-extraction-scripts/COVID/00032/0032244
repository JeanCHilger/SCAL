<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1977-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>New human adenovirus (candidate adenovirus type 35) causing fatal disseminated infection in a renal transplant recipient.</TITLE><BODY>An antigenically distinct adenovirus is described which was isolated in March 1973 from the lungs and kidney of a 61-year-old woman who died of diffuse interstitial adenovirus pneumonia 55 days after receiving a cadaveric renal allograft. Complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, and serum neutralization tests on sequential serum specimens from the patient confirmed that the adenovirus infection occurred in coincidence with her clinical illness and failed to document concomitant infection by any other common respiratory agent. Pathological and virological findings indicated that the pneumonia was only one manifestation of a disseminated adenovirus infection, the source of which may have been a latent infection pre-existing in the donor kidney. The adenovirus, purified by terminal dilution and plaque procedures, has antigenic, morphological, biological, biophysical, host susceptibility, and hemagglutinating properties characteristic of adenovirus group 1A. Buoyant densities in CsCl are 1.340 g/ml for the virion, 1,300 g/ml for the group complement-fixing (hexon) antigen, and 1.290 g/ml for the major soluble complete hemagglutinin (dodecon). The virus was serologically distinct from adenoviruses 1 to 34 in reciprocal serum neutralization tests with antisera to these viruses. We propose this virus as candidate adenovirus type 35 (holden).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
