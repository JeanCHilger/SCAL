In the early stages of the disease the calves were fed either enough milk to maintain normal growth in a healthy calf, one half that volume or no milk. The three groups were further subdivided according to whether or not the electrolyte solution contained bicarbonate. A full milk ration allowed uninterrupted weight gains of 1% body weight/day (p = 0.003), but caused greater inappetence (p = 0.003 to 0.037) at the beginning of the trial than lower levels of milk intake. Electrolyte solutions with bicarbonate reduced growth rates in milk fed calves (p = 0.014). The density of fat stores increased with the level of milk feeding (p = 0.04 to 0.053). The mitotic index of the duodenal mucosa increased with milk feeding (p = 0.08), indicating a superior mucosal regeneration potential. Thymic atrophy was pronounced in those calves fed no milk (p = 0.001). It was concluded that the continued feeding of milk to diarrheic calves was beneficial. Electrolyte solutions containing bicarbonate should be avoided when milk is fed to diarrheic calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
