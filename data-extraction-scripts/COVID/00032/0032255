Stohlman, S. Kyuwa, J. Polo, D. Brady, M. Lai, and C. Bergmann, J. Virol. 67:7050-7059, 1993). Peripheral induction of CTL specific for the nucleocapsid protein of JHMV by vaccination with recombinant vaccinia viruses was unable to provide significant protection to a subsequent lethal virus challenge. By contrast, the transfer of nucleoprotein-specific CTL protected mice from a subsequent lethal challenge by reducing virus replication within the central nervous system, demonstrating the importance of the CTL response to this epitope in JHMV infection. Transfer of these CTL directly into the central nervous system was at least 10-fold more effective than peripheral transfer. Histological analysis indicated that the CTL reduced virus replication in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Although the CTL were relatively ineffective at reducing virus replication in oligodendroglia, survivors showed minimal evidence of virus persistence within the central nervous system and no evidence of chronic ongoing demyelination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
