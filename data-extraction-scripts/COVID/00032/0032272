<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013</DATELINE><TITLE>DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYMES AS PROMISING DRUG TARGETS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES</TITLE><BODY>Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifications from proteins and they have been known to contribute to processes relevant in microbial infection, such as immune responses pathways. Numerous viral and bacterial DUBs have been identified, and activities of several host DUBs are known to be modulated during the infection process, either by a pathogen or by a host. Recently there have been attempts to take advantage of this feature and design therapeutic inhibitors of DUBs that can be used to limit the spread of infection. This review is focused on exploring the potential of DUBs in the treatment of infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
