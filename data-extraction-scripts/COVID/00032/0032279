Three days before collection, the peritoneal cavities were stimulated with glutaraldehyde-fixed Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to induce greater numbers of macrophages and to begin the activation sequence. Peritoneal macrophages from cats stimulated once with yeast consisted mainly of small macrophages and a smaller number of larger activated macrophages. After several days in culture, many of the small macrophages became activated and a portion of the activated macrophages developed into multinucleated giant cells. Peritoneal cells from cats that were stimulated twice or three times with yeast at 3-week intervals consisted of a higher proportion of activated macrophages initially and produced more and larger multinuclear giant cells with time. Cultures of peritoneal cells stimulated once with yeast were easily infected in vitro with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and produced a transient burst of reverse transcriptase activity. After the initial burst of virus replication, the infection became latent. Even more multinucleated giant cells appeared after infection, and many of these cells fused with each other. Replicating virus could be rescued from the latently infected macrophages after 2 to 3 weeks of phorbol myristate acetate stimulation and cocultivation with T-lymphocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Multiply stimulated peritoneal cells, which contained a much higher proportion of activated macrophages, could also be infected in vitro with FIV. The infection usually became latent, however, without going through an initial replicative stage. Peritoneal cells from chronically FIV-infected specific-pathogen-free cats contained a higher proportion of activated macrophages and were latently infected with FIV from the outset.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
