<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1979-04-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterization of EV-2, a Virus Isolated from European Eels (Anguilla anguilla) with Stomatopapilloma</TITLE><BODY>A virus designated EV-2 has been isolated from external tumor tissue and internal organs of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) with stomatopapilloma. It contains RNA and is ether, acid, and temperature labile above 4°C, and concentrated preparations agglutinate chicken and sheep erythrocytes. The addition of actinomycin D during the first 2.75 h of infection inhibits viral replication. As determined in sucrose gradients, the buoyant density of the virus is 1.19 g/cm(3). EV-2 has a moderately pleomorphic spherical morphology; its diameter ranges from 80 to 140 nm. The virion has narrow, regularly spaced surface projections about 10 nm long. Replication in FHM cells at 15°C shows new infectivity appearing at 10 h postinfection and reaching a plateau at 20 h. Cytopathic effects consist of cell fusion, syncytia, and irregularly rounded cell masses. Viral antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells by specific immunofluorescence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
