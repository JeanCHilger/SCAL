In contrast to IFN-γ-+/− and IFN-γ+/+ mice, JHMV persisted in IFN-γ−/− mice and induced death during the subacute phase of the infection. Unexpectedly, infected IFN-γ−/− mice showed severe peritonitis accompanying the accumulation of a viscous fluid in the abdominal and thoracic cavities in the subacute phase. Destructive changes of hepatocytes were not observed. Administration of recombinant IFN-γ protracted the survival time of IFN-γ−/− mice after JHMV infection. These results demonstrate that IFN-γ plays a critical role in viral clearance in JHMV infection. They also show that a resultant persistent JHMV infection induces another form of disease in IFN-γ−/− mice, which bears a resemblance to feline infectious peritonitis in cats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
