Synthesis of the Gag-Pro fusion polyprotein is facilitated by ribosomal frameshift into the reading frame of the pro gene. Cloning of a synthetic 41-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the gag-pro junction within a heterologous gene (nef of human immunodeficiency virus type I) and mutation analysis revealed that two cis-acting signals, an adenosine residue stretch and a dyad symmetry sequence, flanking the UAA termination codon, are required for efficient ribosomal frameshifting between gag and pro. The stability of the stem-loop structure is crucial for frameshifting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
