All calves were determined to be free of BDV and neutralizing antibodies to BDV before infection. Platelet counts were performed on a daily basis over a 30-day period beginning at the time of infection. By 2 weeks postinfection, all calves showed a significant drop in the number of circulating platelets and a marked hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. In three of the seven calves, thrombocytopenia was severe (less than or equal to 5,000/microliters) for 1 to 6 days. In two of these three animals, extensive petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages were observed on all mucosal surfaces and on various internal organs during the period of severe thrombocytopenia. BDV was consistently isolated from the platelets during the early phases of the infection, and viral antigen was occasionally detected on platelets by a fluorescent-antibody assay. The results demonstrate that BDV infection is associated with decreases in platelet numbers and suggest that platelets may serve as carriers of circulating virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
