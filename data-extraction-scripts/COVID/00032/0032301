The system is reproducible within 1 index unit at the 95% level of probability. Comparison of the MNT to tests in eggs resulted in a positive correlation (B =0.81), which was significant (P greater than 0.01). The quantitative dose-response relationship of the MNT is linear (P greater than 0.005), with the 95% prediction limits fitting between one 10-fold dilution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
