Twelve of the 17 patients presented with visual problems, 12 had lower extremity weakness or paraperesis/paralysis, and 6 had bladder/bowel dysfunction. Following 4 months of therapy, 4 recovered completely, 7 showed loss of paralysis/paraparesis, and 5 had improvement in lower extremity weakness. One patient progressed (mean DSS: 51). Lymphokine inhibitor factors declined in 14 patients with concomitant normalization of circulating immune complexes. Eight patients experienced rises in CD4 levels with stabilization of CD8 levels. Hypotension and hypocalcemia were observed during plasmapheresis. Twelve patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with poor performance status also were studied. Four of the 12 improved with the regimen, whereas six stabilized disease. Similar alterations in laboratory parameters were described. The rationale for this approach is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
