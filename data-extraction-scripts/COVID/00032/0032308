Neurons derived from dorsal root ganglia produced viral antigen and infectious virus. Astrocytes and fibroblasts both produced viral antigen but not infectious virus. Oligodendrocytes produced neither infectious virus nor viral antigen. Human embryo brain cells, including astrocytes, were susceptible to OC43 infection but did not produce infectious virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
