<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1992-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Arthritis induced in rats with adjuvant oil is a genetically restricted, alpha beta T-cell dependent autoimmune disease.</TITLE><BODY>Adjuvant arthritis in rats is usually induced by injection of mycobacterium tubercle cell walls suspended in various adjuvant oils such as Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) or pristane. We have recently shown that injection of adjuvant oils without inclusion of mycobacterium tubercle cell walls triggers arthritis [oil adjuvant-induced arthritis (OIA)] in the DA rat strain. The OIA is a genetically restricted disease since only DA rats are susceptible while Lewis, DA-fostered Lewis and F1 (Lew x DA) rats are relatively resistant. Activated alpha beta T cells infiltrate the affected joints of adjuvant oil-injected DA rats and treatment with monoclonal antibodies to the alpha beta T-cell receptor abrogates development of arthritis. These findings show that alpha beta T-cell activation is a critical event in the development of OIA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
