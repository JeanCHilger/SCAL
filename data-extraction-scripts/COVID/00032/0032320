Sequence analysis of approximately 2,800 consecutive bases derived from overlapping PCR clones of a recent minireovirus clinical isolate showed 52% nucleotide sequence identity with the Norwalk virus sequence and, in addition, demonstrated that the genomic organizations of these two viruses were similar. Our data show that minireovirus is a Norwalk-like virus and should now also be included in the Caliciviridae family.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
