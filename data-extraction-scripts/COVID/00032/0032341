Monospecific antiserum to HSV-1 gC immunoprecipitated a 92,000-molecular-weight protein synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin and isotopically labeled with glucosamine or galactose. Anti-gAB did not immunoprecipitate a carbohydrate-labeled HSV-1 protein synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin. The purified glucosamine-labeled 92,000-molecular-weight protein synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin and the fully glycosylated forms of gAB and gC were tested for their sensitivity to mild alkaline hydrolysis. Purified gAB was resistant to mild alkaline hydrolysis, whereas gC and the 92,000-molecular-weight protein were both sensitive to mild alkaline hydrolysis. These results suggest that O-glycosidic linkages are associated with the HSV-1 gC glycoprotein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
