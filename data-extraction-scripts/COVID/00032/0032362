High levels of type 1 interferon activity were found early in the disease in jejunal and ileal parts of the intestine as well as in the serum. Enterocytes appeared to be involved in the interferon synthesis. These findings raise the question of the role of interferon in the pathogenesis of viral enteritis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
