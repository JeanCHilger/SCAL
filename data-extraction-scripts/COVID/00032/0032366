Northern blots showed that JHM virus infection rapidly reduced the level of actin mRNA, whereas the levels of major histocompatibility complex class I and tubulin mRNAs were reduced only slightly. By contrast, the mRNA levels of interleukin 1 beta, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha increased following infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
