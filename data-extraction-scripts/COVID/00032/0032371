Using oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, a single nucleotide, cytosine at position 3305 (viral genome), was changed in this infectious cDNA to a thymine. The mutated nucleotide is located in an area coding for a neutralizing epitope on loop II of VP-1. Virus OSM101, produced from the mutagenized plasmid pDA101, had the same growth characteristics and plaque phenotype in vitro as the virus DAFL3 produced from clone pDAFL3. However, in vivo in the mouse, virus OSM101 was markedly less neurovirulent than DAFL3. Central nervous system tissues from mice infected 4 to 6 weeks previously with the OSM101 virus contained less infectious virus and fewer infected cells than central nervous system tissues from animals infected with the control virus, DAFL3. Thus, we demonstrated that the single nucleotide change resulting in an amino acid substitution at position 101 (threonine to isoleucine) of VP-1 determines one aspect of Theiler's virus persistence and disease in mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
