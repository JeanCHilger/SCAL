This legislation was the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act. A concern underlying this and related efforts to address future bioterrorism threats was the perceived inadequacy of state laws to respond effectively when such threats occur.

The conclusion is that the model legislation generally served as an important catalyst for state action in the field of bioterrorism preparation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
