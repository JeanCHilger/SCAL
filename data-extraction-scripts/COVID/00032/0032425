<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1984-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Latex immunoassay for rapid detection of rotavirus.</TITLE><BODY>A latex agglutination (LA) test was evaluated for the detection of human rotaviruses in stool specimens. Both antiserum and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-sensitized latex particles were used, with IgG-coated beads being more sensitive for human rotavirus antigen detection. Latex beads sensitized with anti-simian-SA-11 IgG were stable for at least 8 months when stored at 4 degrees C. The sensitivity of the test was compared with that of the Rotazyme (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostics Div., North Chicago, Ill.) test. The least number of particles detected was 9.0 X 10(5) particles by the LA test versus 4.5 X 10(5) particles by the Rotazyme test. When 10 stool specimens were serially diluted for antigen endpoint determinations, the geometric mean titer by the LA test was 592 versus 1,280 by the Rotazyme test. Forty-three stool samples positive by the Rotazyme test were all positive by the LA test, and no false negative results were detected. Unconfirmed false positive reactions ranged between 8 and 24%. The LA test for rotavirus antigen detection is direct, easy to perform, sensitive, quick, and may have application for use in diagnostic laboratories, emergency rooms, and physician's offices.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
