In this study, we examined the effects of isoflurane (4%) compared with brief CO(2) (70% CO(2), 30% air) anesthesia on circadian rhythms of plasma measures of physiology and metabolism. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (Crl:SD; n = 6 per group) were maintained on a 12:12-h light:dark (300 lx; lights on, 0600) photoperiod. After 1 wk of acclimation, a series of 6 low-volume blood draws were collected by cardiocentesis under anesthesia using isoflurane (10 min or less) compared with CO(2) (1 min or less) at a single circadian time point every 4 d (0400, 0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, or 2400) over 3 wk to assess arterial blood glucose, lactic acid, and potassium and plasma melatonin, leptin, insulin, total fatty acids, and corticosterone concentrations. Results revealed that plasma levels (mean ± SEM) of melatonin were low (11 ± 1 pg/mL) during the light phase in both groups but were significantly lower during the dark phase in the isoflurane group (48 ± 6 pg/mL) compared with the CO(2) group (162 ± 18 pg/mL). In addition, prominent circadian rhythms of arterial plasma levels of corticosterone, glucose, total fatty acids, lactic acid, and potassium were altered in the isoflurane group compared with the CO(2) group. These findings demonstrate that the normal circadian rhythms of endocrine physiology and metabolism observed during brief CO(2) anesthesia in rats are markedly disrupted by isoflurane anesthesia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
