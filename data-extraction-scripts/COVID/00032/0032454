The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the signalling pathway leading to procoagulant expression was studied. Murine hepatitis virus strain 3 initiated a rapid increase in phosphotyrosine accumulation. Tyrosine kinase inhibition precluded this increase and abrogated expression of the virus-induced procoagulant mouse fibrinogen-like protein (musfiblp) gene. These findings suggest that manipulation of this signalling pathway in vivo might represent a novel approach to treating this disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
