In the same series of experiments, changes in the levels of NR protein (NRP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and changes in the level of NADH-nitrate reductase activity (NRA) were also followed. During a light-dark cycle, it was found that in both tomato and tobacco, NR mRNA accumulation increased rapidly during the dark period and reached a maximum at the beginning of the day, while NRP reached a peak 2 and 4 hours after mRNA peaked, for tomato and tobacco, respectively. At the end of the day, the amount of mRNA was decreased by a factor of at least 100 compared to sunrise in both species. These results demonstrate that light is involved, although probably not directly, in the regulation of the NR gene expression at the mRNA level. The peak of NRA in tobacco coincided with the peak in NR mRNA accumulation (i.e. sunrise), whereas in tomato the peak of NRA was approximately 5 to 6 hours after sunrise. There is no obvious correlation between NRP and NRA levels during the day. In nitrogen starvation experiments, a rapid decrease of NRP and NRA was detected, while NR mRNA levels were not significantly altered. Upon nitrate replenishment, nitrogen-starved plants accumulated NR mRNA rapidly. These results suggest that the availability of nitrogen affects the expression of NR activity at the transcriptional as well as at the post-transcriptional levels.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
