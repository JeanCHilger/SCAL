The mechanisms of virus pathogenesis are still obscure. The occurrence of defective proviruses in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of infected individuals is a frequent feature of virus infection. We detected defective proviruses with large internal deletions in PBMC from ATLL and HAM/TSP patients and in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Seventeen PCR-amplified defective proviruses were sequenced, and three types of deletions were found. Besides truncated MA and the 5â€² end of the genome, truncated CA, truncated SU, and more frequently truncated TM linked to the pX region were detected. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of PBMC from ATLL patients and asymptomatic carriers also revealed RNA transcripts with large internal deletions. Analysis of two RT-PCR cDNA clones confirmed a Gag-TM-pX structure of the transcripts. Most defective proviruses contained numerous internal stop codons, but some were capable of coding for the truncated MA linked to a variable out-of-frame peptide. Cloned defective proviruses with long open reading frames were subjected to in vitro transcription-translation followed by radioimmunoprecipitation, which showed expression of chimeric proteins between 8 and 12 kDa. Possible roles of defective proviruses and chimeric proteins are discussed, although there is no firm association with pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
