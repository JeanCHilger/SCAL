Thioglycolate-elicited and resident peritoneal cells from uninfected mice were able to suppress viral growth in a permissive cell. The active cell in both populations is an adherent, radiation-resistant, Thy-1.2 antigen- and Ia antigen-negative cell. The suppression of virus replication was not related to nonspecific cellular cytotoxicity directed against the permissive host cell, and no interferon was detected. The expression of extrinsic antiviral activity was not related to the ability of the host to resist mouse hepatitis virus infection by virtue of either age or genetic background. The expression of intrinsic antiviral activity, on the other hand, correlated with the ability of the host to resist virus challenge, indicating a characteristic distinction between these two in vitro mechanisms of macrophage-mediated antiviral activity with regard to host resistance to viral infection. Further, the ability of a macrophage to support viral replication itself was independent of the ability of the macrophage to suppress virus growth in another cell.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
