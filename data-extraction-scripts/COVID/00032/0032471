Immunocompetent Arabian foals and Arabian foals with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which lack functional B and T lymphocytes, were experimentally infected with EIAV. Levels of viremia and a number of clinical and hematologic parameters were examined prior to and following infection. Thrombocytopenia was not dependent on the immune response: SCID foals were affected as severely as immunocompetent foals. Production of platelets, measured by metabolic incorporation of radioactive label, was significantly reduced. The decrease ranged from 35 to 89% in three SCID and two immunocompetent foals examined. Platelet survival, measured by 51Cr labeling, also declined following infection in both SCID and immunocompetent foals: 51 and 68%, respectively, relative to the preinfection life spans. The difference between immunocompetent and immunodeficient foals was not statistically significant. The number of megakaryocytes (MK) per square millimeter of bone marrow, determined by digitizing morphometry, was not significantly altered in either SCID or immunocompetent thrombocytopenic foals. Numbers of denuded MK nuclei per unit area increased, but the elevation was not statistically significant. No evidence for viral replication in MK was found. Three different parameters of intravascular coagulation (activated prothombin time, fibrin degradation products, and one-step prothombin time) remained normal until after platelet numbers had declined significantly, arguing against an important role for disseminated intravascular coagulation. The findings indicate that EIAV induces thrombocytopenia principally through an indirect, noncytocidal suppressive effect on platelet production, the mechanism of which is unknown. A shortening of platelet life span apparently contributes moderately to the platelet deficit as well. The shortening of platelet life span is multifactorial in origin, including both mechanisms that depend on an active immune response and those that do not.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
