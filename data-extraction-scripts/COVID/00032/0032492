Northern RNA blotting showed that the Miller strain contained eight intracellular RNA species. RNAs 1, 2(S), 5, 6(M), 7(N), and 8 were similar in size for both viruses; however, the SP variant lacked subgenomic RNAs 3 and 4. Instead, the SP virus contained an altered RNA species (delta 4) that was slightly smaller than RNA 4. S1 nuclease protection experiments showed a deletion of approximately 450 nucleotides in the SP genome downstream of the peplomer S gene. Sequencing of cDNA clones confirmed that SP virus contained a 462-nucleotide deletion, eliminating the transcriptional recognition sequences for both RNAs 3 and 4. These RNAs encode open reading frames A and B, respectively. An alternative consensus recognition sequence was not readily apparent for the delta 4 RNA species of SP virus. Since open reading frame A is missing in SP virus, it is not essential for a productive infection. The status of the potential protein encoded by open reading frame B is not clear, because it may be missing or just truncated. Nevertheless, these genes appear to be the contributing entities for transmissible gastroenteritis virus virulence, SP morphology, tissue tropism, and/or persistence in swine leukocytes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
