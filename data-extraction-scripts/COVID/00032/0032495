To define the replication signal of MHV RNA, we have used a vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase-transcribed MHV DI RNA to study the effects of sequence deletion on DI RNA replication. Following infection of susceptible cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase, various cDNA clones derived from a DI RNA (DIssF) of the JHM strain of MHV, which is a 3.5-kb naturally occurring DI RNA, behind a T7 promoter were transfected. On superinfection with a helper MHV, the ability of various DI RNAs to replicate was determined. Serial deletions from the middle of the RNA toward both the 5' and 3' ends demonstrated that 859 nucleotides from the 5' end and 436 nucleotides from the 3' end of the MHV RNA genome were necessary for RNA replication. Surprisingly, an additional stretch of 135 nucleotides located at 3.1 to 3.3 kb from the 5' end of the genome was also required. This stretch is discontiguous from the 5'-end cis replication signal and is present in all of the naturally occurring DI RNAs studied so far. The requirement for a long stretch of 5'- and 3'-end sequences predicts that the subgenomic MHV mRNAs cannot replicate. The efficiency of RNA replication varied with different cDNA constructs, suggesting possible interaction between different regions of DI RNA. The identification of MHV RNA replication signals allowed the construction of an MHV DI-based expression vector, which can express foreign genes, such as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
