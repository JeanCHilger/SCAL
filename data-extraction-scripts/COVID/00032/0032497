In this review, the development of microarray technology for protein glycosylation analysis is described. Three types are discussed: carbohydrate, lectin and natural glycoprotein microarrays. The advantages of microarray technology to study protein glycosylation are high-volume throughput coupled with a highly miniaturized platform. These techniques show great promise for detecting interactions that involve carbohydrates and as a screening tool to detect glycan patterns important for the early diagnosis of disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
