Local cellular reactivity to virus infection.</TITLE><BODY>An animal model was used to examine local and systemic cellular reactivity against virus infection of bowel mucosa. Firstly, existing techniques for extracting lymphoid cells from the dispersed populations of the bowel mucosa were adapted for use in rabbits and viable lymphocytes were isolated from the lapine ileal mucosa in numbers suitable for assay. Lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) showed a strong blastogenic response to T-cell mitogens but intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) responded poorly, even in the presence of splenic accessory cells. Next, chronically isolated ileal loops in rabbits were infected with parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3) and isolates from the organized and dispersed lymphoid tissues associated with infected ileal mucosae and those from systemic lymphoid sites were used in in vitro assays of virus-specific lympho-proliferation. A T-cell-mediated immune response against PI-3 was mounted in lymphoid tissues associated with the infected loops, appearing first in loop Peyer's patches (PP) at Day 4 and in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and lamina propriae at Day 7 after infection. The response in PP had waned by 21 days but was sustained in the other sites for at least 42 days. Epithelial lymphocytes were consistently anergic and there was no evidence of specific reactivity at systemic lymphoid sites or elsewhere in the bowel. Thus, a highly localized T-cell-mediated response was sustained, not only in organized lymphoid tissues but also in the bowel wall itself, following infection with a novel antigen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
