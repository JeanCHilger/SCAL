Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) is an important cytokine produced during the early stages of an infection by macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and other cell types, and it is also a central cytokine mediator for the induction of cellular or Th1 immunity. To better understand innate and adaptive immune responses after infection with Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), we investigated serum IFN-γ concentrations and the duration of viremia. For 2 strains of atypical PRRSV, IFN-γ was detectable in swine serum soon after infection and lasted for approximately 3 wk. Serum concentrations of IFN-γ peaked at about 10 d after inoculation and returned to approximately baseline levels by day 22. However, individual pigs manifested short, sporadic increases in the serum concentration of IFN-γ from 18 to 50 d after inoculation. Prior vaccination blocked the serum IFN-γ response associated with homologous virus challenge and altered the kinetics of the response after heterologous challenge. Two other respiratory viruses of pigs, Porcine respiratory coronavirus and Swine influenza virus, do not appear to induce serum IFN-γ. The early production of IFN-γ in PRRSV-infected pigs might result from activation of NK cells, a response that is more characteristic of immune pathways stimulated by intracellular bacterial and protozoan infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
