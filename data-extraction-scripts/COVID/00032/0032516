We investigated whether iron chelation might be of benefit in the treatment of pneumonic pasteurellosis of calves. Neutrophils obtained from calves previously treated with the iron chelator, deferoxamine, were studied for their responses to latex and opsonized zymosan by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan by superoxide generation. Treatment with deferoxamine in vivo failed to influence these in vitro measures of neutrophil oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, iron depletion with deferoxamine failed to modify the pathophysiological derangements that occurred in calves following experimental induction of pneumonia by intratracheal inoculation with Pasteurella haemolytica. These data indicate that iron chelation using deferoxamine cannot be recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy in the treatment of pneumonic pasteurellosis of cattle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
