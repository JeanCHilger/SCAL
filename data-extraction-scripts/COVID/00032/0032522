We compared RRV and WC3 in a murine model of oral infection. We determined the relative capacities of these viruses to induce a virus-specific humoral immune response by intestinal lymphocytes as tested by enzyme-linked immunospot assay, intestinal fragment culture, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of intestinal contents. We found that inoculation of mice with RRV induced higher frequencies of virus-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA)-secreting cells in the lamina propria, greater quantities of virus-specific IgA in intestinal fragment cultures, and greater quantities of virus-specific IgA in intestinal secretions than did inoculation with WC3 or inactivated RRV (iRRV). The induction of an IgA response in serum was predictive of an IgA response among intestinal lymphocytes after inoculation with RRV but not WC3. In addition, large quantities of IgG, IgA, and IgM not specific for rotavirus were produced in fragment cultures from mice inoculated with RRV but not in cultures from mice inoculated with WC3 or iRRV. Possible mechanisms of RRV-induced polyclonal stimulation of intestinal B cells are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
