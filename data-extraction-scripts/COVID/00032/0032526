Effector cells for CTL assays were collected from chickens infected with the Gray strain of IBV or inoculated with a DNA plasmid encoding nucleocapsid proteins. IBV-specific CTL epitopes were mapped within the carboxyl-terminal 120 amino acids of the nucleocapsid protein. CTL lysis of target cells infected with SFV encoding nucleocapsid was major histocompatibility complex restricted and mediated by CD8+ T cells. In addition, splenic T cells collected from chickens inoculated in the breast muscle with a DNA plasmid encoding this CTL epitope(s) recognized target cells infected with wild-type virus or an SFV vector encoding nucleocapsid proteins. CTL activity of splenic T cells collected from chicks immunized with a DNA plasmid encoding CTL epitopes was cross-reactive, in that lysis of target cells infected with serologically distinct strains of IBV was dose responsive in a manner similar to that for lysis of target cells infected with the homologous strain of IBV. Furthermore, chickens immunized with a DNA plasmid encoding a CTL epitope(s) were protected from acute viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
