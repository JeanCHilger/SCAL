Virol. 39:823-834, 1981). In this study, we examined virus-specific negative-stranded RNA to determine whether there are corresponding multiple negative-stranded RNAs. Intracellular RNA from mouse hepatitis virus-infected cells was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and hybridized to positive-stranded genomic 60S [32P]RNA. Only a single RNA species of genomic size was detected under these conditions. This RNA was negative stranded. No negative-stranded subgenomic RNA was detected. We also studied double-stranded replicative-form RNA in the infected cells. Only one replicative-form of genomic size was detected. When the double-stranded RNA isolated without RNase treatment was analyzed, again only one RNA species of genomic size was detectable. Furthermore, most of the virus-specific mRNAs could be released from this RNA species upon heating. These results suggest that all of the mouse hepatitis virus-specific RNAs are transcribed from a single species of negative-stranded RNA template of genomic size.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
