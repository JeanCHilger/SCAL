Specific alterations in the normal turnover of this PTM are frequently observed in tumors. The conjugation/deconjugation cycle of ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins influences the activities of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Two families of enzymes work in antagonizing manner to add or remove Ub and Ubl-proteins on target proteins: the E3 ligases and the isopeptidases. These enzymes are the subjects of fervent research with the ambition to comprehend their regulation, their mechanisms of action, their involvement in human diseases, and to develop specific inhibitors for therapeutic intervention. Here we will discuss of isopeptidases, the deconjugating enzymes, with particular emphasis on the proapoptotic activities of the relative inhibitors identified so far.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
