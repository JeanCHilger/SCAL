With the condition of immune cell balancing function collapse, the human body lost the function of clearing intravenous foreign pathogenic microorganism and malignant cells timely and effectively. Thus, integrins β2 and β3 on the membrane of white blood cells and platelets are activated to combine with the ligand fibrinogen into a reversible mesh-like structure, which is like the intravenous biological filter and acts as physical defense of the human body to prevent the cells which are infected by foreign pathogenic microorganism and malignant cells in the distal veins from flowing back to the whole body. Meanwhile, blood cells mainly red blood cells stagnate and fulfill the filter, which blocks the blood flow in the local veins and thus results in venous thrombotic diseases. People with collapsed immune cell balancing functions are the certain groups of people who will develop venous thromboembolism. Anyone who had venous thromboembolism indicates alloantigen cells in the veins, which are mainly pathogenic microorganism infected cells and malignant cells and trigger the onset of venous thromboembolism. Only under the condition of immune cell balancing function collapse, the risk factors, such as advanced age, infection, trauma, surgery, autoimmune disease, pregnancy as well as long trip syndrome, could cause venous thromboembolism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
