In this study 500 stool specimens taken from 1996 to 1998 from children with acute diarrhea in Buenos Aires were examined. Group A rotavirus was unequivocally demonstrated in 62% of the samples tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of VP6 antigen, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of double-stranded RNA, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for amplification of the VP7:G (1,062 bp) and VP4:P (876 bp) genes. Only five positive specimens were found by RT-PCR but not by ELISA. G and P typing was carried out by nested amplification of variable sequences of the VP7 and the VP4 genes with six G- and five P-type-specific primers (multiplex PCR). Results obtained by this method showed the prevalence of the following G and P types: G1, 39%; G2, 43%; G4, 4%; P[8], 16%; P[4], 71%. Unexpectedly, the G-P type combination most frequently found was G2P[4] (43%) rather than G1P[8] (12%), which is the most commonly found worldwide. Unusual strains of the type G1P[4] accounted for 14% of the total, while mixed infections with more than one type were found in 10% of the samples. Detection of fecal rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgA antibodies in consecutive samples of two patients taken at daily intervals demonstrated that high levels of IgM and IgA antibodies were detected on day 1 after the onset of disease and that the samples remained positive for about 10 days, after which virus shedding was no longer observed. Multiplex PCR offers a sensitive and specific alternative to determine the prevalence of group A rotavirus G and P types and to identify the emergence of uncommon strains, whereas detection of fecal IgM and IgA antibodies represents a useful supplement to virus detection for the diagnosis of current or recently acquired infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
