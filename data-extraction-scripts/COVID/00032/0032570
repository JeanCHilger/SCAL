<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1986-08-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity against coronavirus 229E-infected cells.</TITLE><BODY>An antibody dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) reaction was elicited using human mixed lymphocyte cultures against coronavirus 229E-infected C-16 cells. The response was assayed in microtitre plates by radioactive chromium release. Optimal killing of target cells was achieved using cells labelled 22 h after infection. A prozone was present and the optimal dilution of sera was invariably 1:200. The majority (70%) of sera tested gave a positive ADCC response. These included all sera judged positive by ELISA, but also some which were judged negative. Two experiments using purified IgG from serum which was ADCC and ELISA positive suggested that the response is mediated by an IgG antibody and that the prozone is due to a separate serum component.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
