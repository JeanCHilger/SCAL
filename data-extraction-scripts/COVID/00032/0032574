In the present study we used embryonic fibroblasts from mice with targeted disruption of the genes encoding for both the p85α and p85β regulatory subunits of PI3′ kinase (p85α-/-β-/-) to precisely define the role of the PI 3 kinase in the control of IFN-induced biological responses. Our data demonstrate that the PI 3 kinase plays dual regulatory roles in the induction of IFN-responses, by controlling both IFNα- and IFNγ- dependent transcriptional regulation of interferon sensitive genes (ISGs) and at the same time regulating the subsequent initiation of mRNA translation for such genes. This includes the Isg15, Cxcl10 and/or Irf7 genes, whose functions are important in the generation of the biological effects of IFNs. Consistent with this, the induction of IFN-antiviral responses is defective in double p85α/p85β knockout cells. Thus, integration of signals via the PI 3 kinase is a critical event during engagement of the IFN receptors that complements both the transcriptional activity of Jak-Stat pathways and controls initiation of mRNA translation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
