<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Acne Management Guidelines by the Dermatological Society of Singapore</TITLE><BODY>Due to the multiethnic patient population with varying skin types in Singapore, clinicians often find the management of acne in their patients to be challenging. The authors developed these guidelines to provide comprehensive advice on individualized acne treatment and to provide a reference guide for all doctors who treat patients of Asian descent. Unique features of acne in Singapore are highlighted. We address concerns such as diet, special population needs, and the benefits, side effects, risks, and cost-effectiveness of currently available acne treatments. These treatment guidelines outline recommendations for the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of children, adolescents, and adults with acne of varying severity, and include advice pertaining to the use of cosmeceuticals and management of scars.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
