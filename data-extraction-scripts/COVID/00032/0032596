Frameshifting depends on the presence of peptidyl-tRNA(AlaCGC) on the GCG codon in the ribosomal P site and on a translational pause stimulated by the slowly decoded AGU codon. Frameshifting occurs on the sequence GCG-AGU-U by out-of-frame binding of a valyl-tRNA to GUU without slippage of peptidyl-tRNA(AlaCGC). This mechanism challenges the conventional understanding that frameshift efficiency must correlate with the ability of mRNA-bound tRNA to slip between cognate or near-cognate codons. Though frameshifting does not require slippery tRNAs, it does require special peptidyl-tRNAs. We show that overproducing a second isoacceptor whose anticodon had been changed to CGC eliminated frameshifting; peptidyl-tRNA(AlaCGC) must have a special capacity to induce +1 frameshifting in the adjacent ribosomal A site. In order to identify other special peptidyl-tRNAs, we tested the ability of each of the other 63 codons to replace GCG in the P site. We found no correlation between the ability to stimulate +1 frameshifting and the ability of the cognate tRNA to slip on the mRNA--several codons predicted to slip efficiently do not stimulate frameshifting, while several predicted not to slip do stimulate frameshifting. By inducing a severe translational pause, we identified eight tRNAs capable of inducing measurable +1 frameshifting, only four of which are predicted to slip on the mRNA. We conclude that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, special peptidyl-tRNAs can induce frameshifting dependent on some characteristic(s) other than the ability to slip on the mRNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
