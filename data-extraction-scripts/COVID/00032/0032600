That VP2 alone can assemble to form capsids is a phenomenon not previously observed in parvoviruses. The stoichiometry of the capsids containing both VP1 and VP2 was similar to that previously observed in parvovirus B19-infected cells. The capsids were similar to native capsids in size and appearance, and their antigenicity was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with B19-specific antibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
