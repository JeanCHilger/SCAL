The distribution of crossovers, which was observed to be dependent on the parental RNA3 sequence, supported the role of RNA structure in recombination. However, a negative correlation between replication of the parental RNA3 constructs and the accumulation of recombinant progeny confirmed the role of selection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
