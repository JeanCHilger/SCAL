It has been proposed that cellular membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) are incorporated in the early stages of virion assembly. We have recently shown that the VV 21-kDa (A17L gene) envelope protein is essential for the formation of viral membranes. In the present work, we identify a 15-kDa VV membrane protein encoded by the A14L gene. This protein is phosphorylated and myristylated during infection and is incorporated into the virion envelope. Both the 21- and 15-kDa proteins are found associated with cellular tubulovesicular elements related to the ERGIC, suggesting that these proteins are transported in these membranes to the nascent viral factories. When synthesis of the 21-kDa protein is repressed, organized membranes are not formed but numerous ERGIC-derived tubulovesicular structures containing the 15-kDa protein accumulate in the boundaries of the precursors of the viral factories. These data suggest that the 21-kDa protein is involved in organizing the recruited viral membranes, while the 15-kDa protein appears to be one of the viral elements participating in the membrane recruitment process from the ERGIC, to initiate virus formation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
