<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1994-01-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Translational Maintenance of Frame: Mutants of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae with Altered -1 Ribosomal Frameshifting Efficiences</TITLE><BODY>A special site on the (+) strand of the L-A dsRNA virus induces about 2% of ribosomes translating the gag open reading frame to execute a -1 frameshift and thus produce the viral gag-pol fusion protein. Using constructs in which a -1 ribosomal frameshift at this site was necessary for expression of lacZ we isolated chromosomal mutants in which the efficiency of frameshifting was increased. These mutants comprise eight genes, named mof (maintenance of frame). The mof1-1, mof2-1, mof4-1, mof5-1 and mof6-1 strains cannot maintain M(1) dsRNA at 30°, but, paradoxically, do not lose L-A. The mof2-1, mof5-1 and mof6-1 strains are temperature sensitive for growth at 37°, and all three show striking cell cycle phenotypes. The mof2-1 strains arrest with mother and daughter cells almost equal in size, mof5-1 arrests with multiple buds and mof6-1 arrests as single large unbudded cells. mof2-1 and mof5-1 strains are also Pet(-). The mof mutations show differential effects on various frameshifting signals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
