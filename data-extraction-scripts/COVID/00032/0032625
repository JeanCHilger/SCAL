Twelve 3-day-old piglets were obtained from a local herd. At 7 days of age four bipolar Ag-AgCl electrodes were surgically implanted at 5 cm intervals on the jejunum. Piglets were divided into fed (n = 7) and fasted (n = 5) groups and a minimum of four daily recordings were made from each pig between 7 and 14 days of age. Slow wave and spike activity were seen in all animals. Slow waves occurred at a frequency of 17.0 +/- 0.3 cycles/min (c.p.m.) in fed and 16.8 +/- 0.2 c.p.m. in fasted piglets. Spike activity predominated, occurring in characteristic migrating myoelectrical complexes (m.m.c.s.) and occupying 79% of the recording time in fed and 73% in fasted piglets (P less than 0.05). The activity front (phase 3) of the m.m.c. recurred every 47.7 +/- 2.4 min in fed, and 50.9 +/- 2.3 min in fasted piglets. The m.m.c. periodicity in both groups was irregular, with a range of 4-145 min in fed, and 8-104 min in fasted piglets. Activity fronts lasted 4.8 +/- 0.1 min in fed and 4.4 +/- 0.1 min in fasted piglets. All piglets demonstrated intense, short (2.5-5.0 s), distinct bursts of intense spike activity (migrating action potential complexes, m.a.p.c.s.). These were rapidly conducted in an aboral direction at a velocity of 1.8 cm/s in fed, and 0.8 cm/s in fasted piglets (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
