We have recently demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of E1 (residues 469 to 481, KCLYYLRGAIAPR) is required for virus release. Alteration of cysteine 470 to alanine did not affect virus release, whereas mutation of leucine 471 to alanine reduced virus production by 90%. In the present study, substitutions of remaining amino acids in the E1 cytoplasmic domain were made in order to investigate the role of each amino acid in regulating rubella virus release. Generated mutants were analyzed in the context of infectious full-length cDNA clone and virus-like particles using combined genetic, biochemical, and electron microscopic approaches. Substitution of a single residue of tyrosine 472 to alanine or tyrosine 473 to serine resulted in a block in virus release without affecting protein transport and virus budding into the lumen of the Golgi complexes. Infectious RNA transcripts bearing these mutations were incapable of forming plaques. Mutants with substitutions at the amino-terminal region (leucine 474, arginine 475, and glycine 476) in the E1 cytoplasmic domain had reduced virus release and small-plaque phenotype, while mutants with substitutions at the carboxy-terminal region (alanine 477, isoleucine 478, alanine 479, proline 480, and arginine 481) had only marginal defects in virus release. Plaque-forming revertants could be isolated from mutants Y472A and Y473S. Sequencing analysis revealed that the substituted serine residue in mutant Y473S reverted to the original tyrosine residue, whereas the substituted alanine residue in mutant Y472A was retained. These results indicate that the E1 cytoplasmic domain modulates virus release in a sequence-dependent manner and that the tyrosine residues are critical for this function. We postulate that residues YYLRG constitute a domain in the E1 tail that may interact with other proteins and this interaction is involved in regulating virus release.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
