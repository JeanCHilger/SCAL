This was a randomized controlled trial comprising 14, 8- to 9-week-old calves seronegative for BRSV. Group 1 calves (n = 8) were not vaccinated and group 2 calves (n = 6) were vaccinated on days 0 and 19 with an inactivated BRSV vaccine. All calves were challenged with virulent BRSV on day 46. Clinical signs, arterial PO(2), and immune responses were monitored after challenge. Calves were euthanatized on day 54 (8 d after challenge) and lungs were examined for lesions. Vaccination elicited increases in BRSV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and virus neutralizing antibody titers. Challenge with BRSV resulted in severe respiratory tract disease and extensive pulmonary lesions in control calves, but no signs of clinical disease and minimal or no pulmonary lesions in vaccinated calves. Arterial blood oxygen values on day 53 (7 d after challenge) in control calves were significantly lower than those in vaccinated calves, which remained within normal limits. Control calves shed BRSV for several days after challenge, whereas BRSV was not detected on deep nasal swabs from vaccinated calves. In summary, the results indicated that this inactivated BRSV vaccine provided clinical protection from experimental infection with virulent virus 27 d after vaccination and significantly decreased the prevalence and severity of pulmonary lesions. Efficacy was similar to that reported for other commercial inactivated and modified-live BRSV vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
