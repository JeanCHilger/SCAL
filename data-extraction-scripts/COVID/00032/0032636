Synthetic transcripts corresponding to different naturally occurring TBSV DI RNAs, or to various artificially constructed TBSV defective RNAs, were analyzed. The relative levels of competitiveness of different DI RNAs were determined by coinoculating their corresponding transcripts into protoplasts along with helper genomic RNA transcripts and monitoring the level of DI RNA accumulation. Further studies were performed to assess the contribution of naked DI RNA stability and DI RNA encapsidation efficiency to the observed levels of competitiveness. In addition, the ability of various defective RNAs to evolve to alternative forms was tested by serially passaging protoplast infections initiated with transcripts corresponding to helper genomic RNA and a single type of defective RNA. These studies, and the analysis of the sequences of observed recombinants, indicate that (i) replication competence is a major factor dictating DI RNA competitiveness and is likely a primary determinant in DI RNA evolution, (ii) DI RNAs are capable of evolving to both smaller and larger forms, and the rates at which various transitions occur differ, (iii) DI RNA-DI RNA recombination and/or rearrangement is responsible for the formation of the evolved RNA molecules which were examined, and (iv) sequence complementarities between positive- and negative-sense strands in the regions of the junctions suggest that, in some cases, base pairing between an incomplete replicase-associated nascent strand and acceptor template may mediate selection of recombination sites. On the basis of our data, we propose a stepwise deletion model to describe the temporal order of events leading to the formation of tombusvirus DI RNAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
