Oronasal and subcutaneous inoculation of coronavirus 229E did not elicit an antibody response by heterologous (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, canine coronavirus) neutralization or by heterologous (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No clinical signs attributable to coronavirus 229E were seen in inoculated cats. Although the number of animals in each of the five experimental groups was small (n = 2), antibodies produced in response to the virus did not appear to sensitize cats to subsequent feline infectious peritonitis virus challenge, but neither did they cross-protect cats against the challenge dose.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
