In preliminary antiviral efficacy evaluations against laboratory strains of both human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, it was determined that two of the compounds (T70072 and T01132) were more active and less toxic in stationary-phase cell monolayers than were the other derivatives tested. T01132 and T70072, which have 2-pentenyl and 3-methyl-2-butenyl moieties attached to position 3 of the 5-aminothiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,7-dione, respectively, were then more extensively evaluated for anti-HCMV activity. The concentrations of T01132 and T70072 required to inhibit HCMV by 50% in plaque reduction assays were approximately 0.5 and 6.8 microM, respectively. These two compounds inhibited the growth of KB, MRC-5, or Vero cells at concentrations of 75 to 150 microM, depending upon the cell line. In bone marrow progenitor cells T01132 was slightly less toxic than ganciclovir (DHPG). The 50% inhibitory concentrations of T01132 against clinical isolates and DHPG-resistant strains of HCMV were approximately the same as those obtained for laboratory strains of HCMV (approximately 0.5 microM). When tested in combination with DHPG, the resultant antiviral activity was determined to be additive but not synergistic. Experiments performed using variations of the viral multiplicity of infection (MOI) demonstrated that T01132 was more active than DHPG at a low MOI (0.002 or 0.02). However, when a higher MOI (0.2 or 2.0) was used, DHPG was more efficacious than T01132. In experiments in which drug was added at various times post-viral infection, T01132 was most effective when added within the first 24 h post-HCMV infection while DHPG was able to protect cells in this assay system when added up to 48 h postinfection, indicating that T01132 is exerting its antiviral effect on events leading up to and possibly including viral DNA synthesis. The data presented in this report suggest that the antiviral activity of alkenyl-substituted thiazolopyrimidine derivatives may represent a mechanism of action against herpesviruses alternative to that of classical nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir or DHPG.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
