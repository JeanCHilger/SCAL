Although the etiology of this disease has remained elusive, a putative viral etiology was suspected and the term ‘rat respiratory virus’ (RRV) has been used in reference to this disease agent. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Pneumocystis carinii infection in immunocompetent rats can cause idiopathic lung lesions previously attributed to RRV. In archived paraffin-embedded lungs (n = 43), a significant association was seen between idiopathic lung lesions and Pneumocystis DNA detected by PCR. In experimental studies, lung lesions of RRV developed in 9 of 10 CD rats 5 wk after intratracheal inoculation with P. carinii. No lung lesions developed in CD rats (n = 10) dosed with a 0.22-µm filtrate of the P. carinii inoculum, thus ruling out viral etiologies, or in sham-inoculated rats (n = 6). Moreover, 13 of 16 CD rats cohoused with immunosuppressed rats inoculated with P. carinii developed characteristic lung lesions from 3 to 7 wk after cohousing, whereas no lesions developed in rats cohoused with immunosuppressed sham-inoculated rats (n = 7). Both experimental infection studies revealed a statistically significant association between lung lesion development and exposure to P. carinii. These data strongly support the conclusion that P. carinii infection in rats causes lung lesions that previously have been attributed to RRV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
