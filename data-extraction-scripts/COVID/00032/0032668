The serine/threonine kinase DRAK2 is a negative regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and sets the threshold for the activation of naïve and memory T cells, and selected thymocytes. Despite enhanced T cell activation, Drak2−/− mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune demyelinating disease that resembles multiple sclerosis. However, the basis for this autoimmune resistance is currently unknown. Here we show that, in the absence of DRAK2 signaling, T cells require greater tonic signaling for maintenance during clonal expansion. Following stimulation, Drak2−/− T cells were more sensitive to an intrinsic form of apoptosis that was prevented by CD28 ligation, homeostatic cytokines, or enforced Bcl-xL expression. T cell-specific Bcl-xL expression also restored the susceptibility of Drak2−/− mice to EAE and enhanced thymic positive selection. These findings demonstrate that DRAK2 is selectively important for T cell survival and highlight the potential that DRAK2 blockade may lead to permanent autoimmune T cell destruction via intrinsic apoptosis pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
