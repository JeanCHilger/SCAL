<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-04-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Identification of a Novel Enteric Helicobacter Species in a Kitten with Severe Diarrhea</TITLE><BODY>A previously undescribed Helicobacter sp. was recovered from a cat with severe diarrhea. Based upon the absence of any other identifiable cause of diarrhea, this helicobacter may be involved in the development of the disease signs. The organism could not be cultured but was described on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and morphology and appeared to be a new species, with Helicobacter canis being the most genetically similar species. The presence of a diarrhea-inducing helicobacter in a companion animal may pose a risk of zoonosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
