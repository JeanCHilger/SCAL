Seymour Benzer’s curiosity was legendary and seemingly limitless.(1-5) Towards the end of his life, one of the (many) questions that kept him awake at night concerned the emerging role of Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) in aging and neurological disease. In this perspective, we will discuss the clinical and biochemical data on ApoD, and the input from the recent genetic studies in model systems, including those from the Benzer lab.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
