However, the effects of analgesics on experimental outcomes are not well-documented. In this study, we incorporated ketoprofen into a well-established experimental protocol. Of the 44 Spragueâ€“Dawley (SD) rats obtained from vendor A that were given either ketoprofen (10 mg/kg SC) or saline and underwent ovariectomy, 19 that received ketoprofen died or were euthanized due to clinical illness within 3 to 7 d after surgery. Necropsy revealed gastrointestinal ulceration consistent with toxicity from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug. In an attempt to identify factors responsible for this unanticipated outcome, SD rats from vendors A and B were subjected to the same protocol, but no clinical signs or pathologic lesions were observed in any of these rats, regardless of source. A third experiment with rats obtained from vendor A and housed in barriers 1 and 2 was done to clarify the conflicting results and to determine whether response to ketoprofen differed at the barrier level. Three of the 6 rats from barrier 2 that received ketoprofen in the third study had gastrointestinal lesions similar to those observed in the first study, whereas none of the rats from barrier 1 had any lesions. These results suggest that the adverse effects seen after administration of ketoprofen were due to differences between barriers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
