However, the exact mechanism of action of NB-DNJ remains to be determined. In this study we have examined the impairment of HIV infectivity mediated by NB-DNJ. By two independent HIV entry assays [PCR-based HIV entry assay and entry of Cocal(HIV) pseudotypes], the reduction in infectivity was found to be due to an impairment of viral entry. No effect of NB-DNJ treatment was seen on the kinetics of the interaction between gp120 and CD4 (surface plasmon resonance; BIAcore) or on the binding of virus particles to H9 cells (using radiolabeled virions). We therefore conclude that a major mechanism of action of NB-DNJ as an inhibitor of HIV replication is the impairment of viral entry at the level of post-CD4 binding, due to an effect on viral envelope components.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
