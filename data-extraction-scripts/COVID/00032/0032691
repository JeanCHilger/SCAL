Correlation with previously reported information about these MAbs suggest that both of the subunits of E2 are important for viral infectivity and cell fusion. Incubation of trypsin-treated virions at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C released only the E2N subunit from virions. The pattern of MAb reactions suggested that a conformational change occurred in the E2N subunit in association with its release from virions under mildly alkaline conditions at 37 degrees C, the same conditions which are optimal for coronavirus-induced cell fusion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
