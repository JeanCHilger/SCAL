<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1968-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Activity of nicotinamide–adenine dinucleotide pyrophosphorylase in liver nuclei. Effects of partial hepatectomy, hepatotoxins and dietary changes</TITLE><BODY>1. The activity of NAD pyrophosphorylase is lower in nuclei isolated from regenerating rat liver than in normal nuclei, and this is due to leakage of the enzyme from the nuclei during the isolation. 2. The NAD pyrophosphorylase activity is lower in liver nuclei from newborn rats, and from rats on a protein-free diet, but no leakage occurs in these cases. 3. Poisoning with α-amanitin brings about a transient enhancement of NAD pyrophosphorylase activity in mouse liver nuclei. 4. No changes of enzyme activity were observed after 72hr. starvation, administration of actinomycin D or infection with MHV3 virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
