Nineteen antigenic mutants resistant to neutralization by some of these antibodies were selected; some continued to normally or partially bind the antibody, whereas others did not. Mutations conferring resistance to neutralization by site II-specific monoclonal antibodies were localized into two clusters, the first between amino acids 34 and 42 (seven groups of mutants) and the second at amino acids 198 and 200 (three groups of mutants). Two intermediate mutations were identified at positions 147 and 184. Four mutations resulted in reduced pathogenicity after intramuscular inoculation of the virus in adult mice. One of the mutants, M23, was 300 times and the others were 10 to 30 times less pathogenic than CVS. In three cases the attenuated phenotype was related to an important modification of antigenic site II, whereas the other known antigenic sites were unchanged.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
