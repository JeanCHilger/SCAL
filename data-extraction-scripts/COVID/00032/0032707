Previous studies have shown that miR-592 play critical roles in cancer cell biological processes. However, the function of miR-592 in CRC remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the miR-592â€™s role in cell proliferation of colorectal cancer. MiR-592 expression was markedly down-regulated in CRC tissues and CRC cells. Overexpression of miR-592 reduced the proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of CRC cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis further revealed CCND3, a putative tumor promoter, was found to be a potential target of miR-592 in CRC. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay results showed that CCND3 was a direct target of miR-592. Ectopic expression of miR-592 led to down-regulation of CCND3 protein, which resulted in the down-regulation of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-Rb). In functional assays, CCND3-silenced in miR-592-in-transfected SW48 cells have positive effect to suppress cell proliferation, suggesting that direct CCND3 suppression is required for miR-592-induced cell proliferation of CRC. We conclude that miR-592 can regulate CCND3 and function as a tumor suppressor in CRC. Therefore, miR-592 represents a potential anti-onco-miR and serves as a useful therapeutic agent for miRNA-based CRC therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
