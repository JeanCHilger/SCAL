One hundred faecal and urine samples were compared. Both methods had a similar sensitivity. Lyphogel was economical, simple, and rapid in use; in contrast to ultracentrifugation, it required relatively little material. The procedure could be done within a safety cabinet, and virus particles were morphologically undamaged by the process.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
