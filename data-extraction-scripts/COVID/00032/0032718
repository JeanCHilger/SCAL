Measles virus induces Ia on rat astrocytes by direct interaction with these cells. TNF does not induce significant levels of Ia at any dose from 1 to 10,000 units/ml. As little as 10 units of TNF per ml, however, amplifies Ia-inducing signals generated by measles virus in astrocytes. In contrast, TNF and measles virus induce class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, when applied individually, and TNF amplification of measles virus class I MHC induction is not apparent. The induction of either Ia or class I MHC antigens on rat astrocytes by measles virus does not depend on glial-derived soluble factors generated during infection. Since brain cells are normally lacking MHC antigens upon which T cells depend for interaction with antigen presenting cells, these data indicate that the ability of measles virus to directly stimulate MHC antigen expression and the ability of TNF to amplify Ia expression locally in the brain may be important in initiating cell-mediated immune response to viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
