Genetically diverse MERS-CoV appear antigenically similar in MN tests. We confirm that MERS-CoV has been circulating in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia in 1993. Preliminary data suggests that feral Australian dromedaries may be free of MERS-CoV but larger confirmatory studies are needed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
