The characterization of antigen A is shown here, and both antigens were evaluated along with lipoarabinomannan antigen in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the serodiagnosis of ovine paratuberculosis. After anion-exchange (DEAE-5PW) and hydrophobic (phenyl-5PW) chromatography using high-performance liquid chromatography, antigen A showed a prominant band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at 31 kDa with small amounts of low-molecular-mass proteins but with no evidence of antigen D. A single precipitin arc was evident with purified antigen A in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence showed a high degree of homology between the 31-kDa component of antigen A and antigens of the BCG85 complex of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, a total of 24 of 26 residues being identical to those of BCG85C. A prominant SDS-PAGE band at 400 kDa and a single crossed-immunoelectrophoresis arc was also evident for antigen D after gel filtration (Sephacryl S-200), anion-exchange (DEAE-Sephacel), and concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. By ELISA, purified antigen A detected antibody in the sera of 18 of 22 paratuberculosis-infected sheep (82% sensitivity), whereas the purified antigen D detected antibody in all 22 infected animals (100% sensitivity). Combined ELISA results showed increased specificity with some loss in sensitivity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
