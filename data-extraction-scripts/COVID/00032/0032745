Previous work suggests that there are differences in BDV replication in neuronal cells and glial cells. Many neurons are lysed by the immunopathologic response to BDV; lysis of dentate gyrus neurons in the absence of encephalitis is seen in rats inoculated with BDV as neonates. In contrast, persistently BDV-infected astrocytes increase over the course of BDV infection. Therefore, we compared BDV replication in neuronal (SK-N-SH and SK-N-SHEP) and astrocytic (C6) cell lines. While SK-N-SH cells produced more infectious virions per cell, the C6 cells contained more BDV proteins and RNA. BDV sequences in the supernatants of both cell types were identified, despite low titers of infectious virus, suggesting the release of incomplete virions into the medium. C6 cells secreted a factor or factors into the medium that enhanced the production of BDV proteins and RNA in other cell lines. In addition, nerve growth factor treatment produced the same enhancement. Thus, BDV replication in certain neural cells in vitro may be linked to the production of cell-specific factors which affect viral replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
