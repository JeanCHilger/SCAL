<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1987-04-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Detection of Breda virus antigen and antibody in humans and animals by enzyme immunoassay.</TITLE><BODY>Enzyme immunoassays were developed for the detection of Breda virus antibody and antigen. Cattle sera collected in the United Kingdom were found to have a high prevalence of antibody (55%) to Breda virus when examined in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A low prevalence of antibody was found in pigs (2.2%), and no antibody was found in sheep or goat sera. No antibody to either Breda virus or Berne virus was detected in human sera collected from veterinarians and farm workers. Only 1 of 430 human fecal specimens (0.2%) contained Breda virus antigen detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
