Infection was based on (i) seroresponse using immunofluorescence and (ii) fecal shedding of virus particles using electron microscopy. Virus was detected in fecal samples for at least 2 to as long as 7 days after inoculation, although peak virus concentrations were observed on days 1 to 4. Diarrheal illness was observed in seven calves on second to fourth serial passage of HRVL in calves but in none of four animals studied on first passage. Diarrhea began 15 to 30.5 h (mean = 22.3 h) post-inoculation and lasted less than 24 h; three of the seven animals that developed diarrhea were also depressed or anorectic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
