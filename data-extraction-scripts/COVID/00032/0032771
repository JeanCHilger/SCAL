<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1993-06-15</DATELINE><TITLE>On the directional specificity of ribosome frameshifting at a "hungry" codon.</TITLE><BODY>Limitation for aminoacyl-tRNA promotes ribosome frameshifting at certain sites. We have previously demonstrated ribosome frameshifting to the right (3') at an AAG site in one context, and to the left (5') at an AAG site in a different context. Here, we demonstrate that the "rightwing" context is largely specific for frameshifting to the right, and the "leftwing" context is largely specific for frameshifting to the left. Analysis of these context rules, and the conversion of a sequence that promotes leftward frameshifting to one that promotes rightward frameshifting, demonstrated here, permits us to define a minimal heptanucleotide sequence sufficient for shiftiness in each direction at an AAG codon whose lysyl-tRNA is in short supply.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
