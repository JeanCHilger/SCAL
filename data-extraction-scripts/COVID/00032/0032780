This pathological process is primarily T cell-mediated and MHV infection of mice lacking B and T cells does not result in demyelination. In apparent contradiction to these results, robust demyelination is detected in MHV-infected young nude (athymic) mice. Herein, we show that demyelination in nude mice was mediated by γδ T cells. These cells, but not conventional CD4 or CD8 αβ T cells, were detected in the central nervous system of MHV-infected nude mice and their depletion with neutralizing antibody resulted in an 80% reduction in demyelination. These results show, for the first time, that γδ T cells can substitute for αβ T cells in a virus model of demyelination and further support a pathological role for γδ T cells in patients with multiple sclerosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
