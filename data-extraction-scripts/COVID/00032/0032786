<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2000-07-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular Characterization of an Avian Astrovirus</TITLE><BODY>Astroviruses are known to cause enteric disease in several animal species, including turkeys. However, only human astroviruses have been well characterized at the nucleotide level. Herein we report the nucleotide sequence, genomic organization, and predicted amino acid sequence of a turkey astrovirus isolated from poults with an emerging enteric disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
