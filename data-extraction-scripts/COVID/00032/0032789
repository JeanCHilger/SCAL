<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1991-03-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Outbreak of human calicivirus gastroenteritis in a day-care center in Sydney, Australia.</TITLE><BODY>Between January and March 1988, an outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred among children and staff at a day-care center in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Over an 11-week period, 53 persons had 101 episodes of gastroenteritis; some patients had 5 separate episodes. The principal etiologic agent in the outbreak, human calicivirus (HCV), was detected by electron microscopy in 32% of fecal specimens from children and staff members with symptoms but in only 8% of asymptomatic individuals (P less than 0.01). HCV was confirmed by both an enzyme immunoassay and solid-phase immune electron microscopy. HCV infection was a particular problem in infants, who had the highest age-specific attack rates, had the greatest symptomatic/asymptomatic infection ratio, and were most likely to have a second symptomatic episode. The mode of transmission of this virus was not identified, and extensive efforts to control the 11-week outbreak had little effect. Prolonged excretion of HCV by some symptomatic patients and high rates of asymptomatic infection may have contributed to the extended duration of the outbreak. HCV may be a common cause of gastroenteritis in children that is under-recognized because of insensitive methods of detection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
