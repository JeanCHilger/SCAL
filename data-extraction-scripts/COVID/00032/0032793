We have purified this protein and determined by partial peptide sequencing that it is polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) (also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein [hnRNP] I), a nuclear protein which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. PTB plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs in normal cells and translation of several viruses. By UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies using cellular extracts and a recombinant PTB, we have established that PTB binds to the MHV plus-strand leader RNA specifically. Deletion analyses of the leader RNA mapped the PTB-binding site to the UCUAA pentanucleotide repeats. Using a defective-interfering RNA reporter system, we have further shown that the PTB-binding site in the leader RNA is critical for MHV RNA synthesis. This and our previous study (H.-P. Li, X. Zhang, R. Duncan, L. Comai, and M. M. C. Lai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:9544â€“9549, 1997) combined thus show that two cellular hnRNPs, PTB and hnRNP A1, bind to the transcription-regulatory sequences of MHV RNA and may participate in its transcription.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
