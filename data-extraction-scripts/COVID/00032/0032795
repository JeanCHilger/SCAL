We previously demonstrated direct binding of the purified HveC ectodomain to purified HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 glycoprotein D (gD). Here, using a baculovirus expression system, we constructed and purified truncated forms of the receptor containing one [HveC(143t)], two [HveC(245t)], or all three immunoglobulin-like domains [HveC(346t)] of the extracellular region. All three constructs were equally able to compete with HveC(346t) for gD binding. The variable domain bound to virions and blocked HSV infection as well as HveC(346t). Thus, all of the binding to the receptor occurs within the first immunoglobulin-like domain, or V-domain, of HveC. These data confirm and extend those of Cocchi et al. (F. Cocchi, M. Lopez, L. Menotti, M. Aoubala, P. Dubreuil, and G. Campadelli-Fiume, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:15700, 1998). Using biosensor analysis, we measured the affinity of binding of gD from HSV strains KOS and rid1 to two forms of HveC. Soluble gDs from the KOS strain of HSV-1 had the same affinity for HveC(346t) and HveC(143t). The mutant gD(rid1t) had an increased affinity for HveC(346t) and HveC(143t) due to a faster rate of complex formation. Interestingly, we found that HveC(346t) was a tetramer in solution, whereas HveC(143t) and HveC(245t) formed dimers, suggesting a role for the third immunoglobulin-like domain of HveC in oligomerization. In addition, the stoichiometry between gD and HveC appeared to be influenced by the level of HveC oligomerization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
