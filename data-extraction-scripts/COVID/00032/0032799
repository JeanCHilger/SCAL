Intracerebral inoculation of mice with 10(5) PFU of mutant ts342 results in prolonged infection of the central nervous system, whereas 100 PFU of wild-type virus are lethal (M. J. M. Koolen, A. D. M. E. Osterhaus, G. van Steenis, M. C. Horzinek, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, Virology 125:393-402, 1983). In the Sac(-) cell line ts342 grows as well at 37 degrees C (the body temperature of mice) as at 31 degrees C (the permissive temperature). There is, however, a difference in primary cultures of mouse brain astrocytes. After infection with ts342, astrocytes produced low levels of infectious virus (5.2 +/- 3.7%) compared with virus yields after infection with wild-type virus. The fraction of wild-type virus- and ts342-infected cells was similar. Electron microscopy showed in wild-type virus-infected cells abundant virions in smooth vesicles usually closely associated with a well-developed Golgi apparatus. In mutant-infected cells no mature ts342 virus particles were found. There was no difference between ts342 and wild-type virus regarding the intracellular virus-specific RNAs. In ts342-infected cells the viral glycoproteins E2 and E1 were not detectable or were barely detectable. Either the mRNAs for the glycoproteins are not translated or the proteins are rapidly broken down. Revertants of ts342 were isolated. They grew as well as wild-type virus in astrocytes, indicating that they apparently produced sufficient amounts of E2 and E1, the ts defect itself rather than a second site mutation is responsible for the defect in replication, and the ts defect acts in unison with host-cell factors. The revertants also regained the lethal properties of wild-type virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
