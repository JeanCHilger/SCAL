While the concept of tissue RAS is gaining more widespread acceptance, the concept of local angiotensin II (AngII) production, acting in coordinate or independently of the endocrine RAS, continues to be debated. The primary reasons that local AngII production has been studied by many investigators are that components of the RAS are expressed by multiple cell types, and that the endocrine RAS cannot fully explain all effects of AngII. Moreover, through the development and study of genetically altered models for over-expression or knockdown of individual RAS components within specific cell types, it is becoming increasingly more evident that local RAS contribute to effects of AngII in normal physiology and disease. The purpose of this review is to define the presence and physiological significance of a local RAS in adipose tissue in relation to cardiovascular disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
