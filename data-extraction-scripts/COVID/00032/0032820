Description and Statistical Evaluation</TITLE><BODY>Standardized hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition procedures are described and statistically evaluated for all animal viruses where applicable, except for rubella and the arbovirus group. The standardized tests employ a constant phosphate-buffered saline diluent and constant volumes of serum, antigen, and standardized erythrocyte suspension. The standardized hemagglutination test has a reproducibility of 84 to 96% with adenoviruses, rubeola, and the myxoviruses, and 78 to 93% with reoviruses; the standardized hemagglutination-inhibition test has a reproducibility of 95 to 100% with all viruses tested.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
