The index children experienced more episodes of acute respiratory infection than their siblings. Respiratory viruses were the major cause of respiratory infections. The index children had lower respiratory tract disease, predominantly wheeze, during 34% of proved respiratory virus infections compared with 11% of such infections experienced by the control children (p less than 0.02). Atopic children had an increased tendency to wheeze that did not reach significance, but atopy was not associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
