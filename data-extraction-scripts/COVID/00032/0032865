Peripheral blood leukocytes collected from six young adult pigs and intraepithelial leukocytes from a further five pigs were used as effector cells in chromium release assays against PK-15 cells persistently infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Both peripheral blood leukocytes and intraepithelial leukocytes were capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity against PK-15 transmissible gastroenteritis cells. While the peripheral blood leukocytes mediated lower levels of specific 51Cr release in spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity than in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, the intraepithelial leukocytes were more effective in spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity than antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
