We intravenously administered 8 mg/kg of 2 USPIO compounds daily for 4 wk to male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats (Crl:SD). Multiecho gradient-echo MRI, serum iron levels, and histology were performed at the end of dosing and after a 7-d washout period. R2* maps and quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) were generated from multiecho gradient-echo data. R2* maps and QSM showed iron accumulation in brain ventricles on MR images acquired at the 4- and 5-wk time points. Estimates from QSM data showed ventricular iron concentration was equal to or higher than serum iron concentration. Histologic analysis revealed choroid plexus hemosiderosis and midbrain vacuolation, without iron deposition in brain parenchyma. Serum iron levels increased with administration of both compounds, and a 7-d washout period effectively reduced serum iron levels of one but not both of the compounds. High cumulative doses from multiple, frequent administrations of USPIO can lead to iron deposition in brain ventricles, resulting in persistent signal loss on T2*-weighted images. Techniques such as QSM are helpful in quantifying iron biodistribution in this situation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
