<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1990-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Porcine group C rotavirus as a cause of neonatal diarrhea in a Quebec swine herd.</TITLE><BODY>A porcine group C rotavirus was found to be the unique cause of a problem of enzootic neonatal diarrhea in a minimal disease herd composed of 190 sows on a continuous farrowing program. During the outbreaks of diarrhea, 10 to 80% of the litters were affected with a morbidity rate of 100% and case fatality rates of 5 to 10%. Clinical signs began 24 to 48 h after birth and were characterized by a profuse yellow diarrhea lasting a few days. Piglets from different outbreaks of diarrhea were necropsied. They had multifocal villous atrophy in the small intestine, especially in the ileum. Group C rotavirus was demonstrated by direct immunofluorescent staining of frozen intestinal sections and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of viral RNA extracted from the intestinal contents of diarrheic piglets. The infection with clinical illness and lesions was reproduced experimentally in newborn piglets by oral inoculation of a suspension prepared from a pool of intestinal contents from diarrheic piglets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
