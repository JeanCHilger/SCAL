Changing profiles of phosphorylated intermediates relate to the progressive series of transduction pathways in cells moving from G0 to G1, and thereafter through the cell cycle. We have previously shown that transient inhibition of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A by okadaic acid enhances early mitogenic stimulation. Thus target proteins of PP1/PP2A may be involved in regulation of early mitogenic signalling, with the phosphorylated form(s) being associated with signal enhancement. Later, pathways require dephosphorylation of these proteins, since continuous treatment with okadaic acid blocks lymphocyte progression through the cell cycle. Delayed addition of okadaic acid showed that this blockade occurs between 8 and 24 hr. Here we have furthered these observations to the level of gene induction by measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for the following proteins: interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2R alpha; p53, a tumour suppressor protein; the transcription factor krox-24; and two mediators of protein folding, namely cyclophilin and the heat-shock protein hsc70. An external standard was used to quantitate the mRNA levels per cell. We found that 24 hr exposure to okadaic acid has a general suppressive effect on concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated gene induction. However, at 4 hr okadaic acid enhanced IL-2 mRNA levels induced by Con A. Moreover, in unstimulated lymphocytes, okadaic acid caused the induction of krox-24, indicating a role for PP1 and PP2A in the regulation of this gene in resting cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
