The origin and function of the subgenomic negative-strand RNAs is controversial. In this report we demonstrate that the synthesis and molar ratios of subgenomic negative strands are similar in alternative host cells, suggesting that these RNAs function as important mediators of positive-strand synthesis. Using kinetic labeling experiments, we show that the full-length and subgenomic-length replicative form RNAs rapidly accumulate and then saturate with label, suggesting that the subgenomic-length negative strands are the principal mediators of positive-strand synthesis. Using cycloheximide, which preferentially inhibits negative-strand and to a lesser extent positive-strand synthesis, we demonstrate that cycloheximide treatment equally inhibits full-length and subgenomic-length negative-strand synthesis. Importantly, following treatment, previously transcribed negative strands remain in transcriptionally active complexes even in the absence of new negative-strand synthesis. These findings indicate that the subgenomic-length negative strands are the principal templates of positive-strand synthesis during MHV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
