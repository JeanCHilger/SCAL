The binding studies were performed with purified capsid protein immobilized on nitrocellulose and 32P-labeled RNAs transcribed in vitro from viral and nonspecific cDNAs. Genomic and defective interfering (DI) RNAs bound capsid protein significantly better than either the subgenomic (26S) RNA or nonspecific RNAs. Transcripts prepared from either truncated or deleted cDNAs were used to define the segment required for binding. This segment, which is represented twice in DI RNA, lies between nucleotides 746 and 1226 of the genomic RNA and is within the coding region of the nonstructural protein nsP1. Insertion of a domain covering these sequences into a nonviral RNA was able to convert it from a background level of binding to an activity that was 80% that of the Sindbis virus DI RNA. We analyzed DI RNA transcripts in detail because they could be studied not only for the ability to bind capsid protein in vitro but also for the ability to be replicated and packaged in vivo in the presence of helper virion RNA. The results obtained with three DI RNAs are reported. One (CTS14), which has one copy of the binding domain, bound efficiently to capsid protein in vitro and was packaged in vivo as measured by amplification on passaging. In contrast, a DI RNA (CTS1) which lacked this region did not bind to capsid protein and was not detected on passaging. By using lipofectin (P. L. Felgner, T. R. Gadek, M. Holm, R. Roman, H. W. Chan, M. Wenz, J.P. Northrop, G. M. Ringold, and M. Danielson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413-7417, 1987) to enhance RNA uptake, we were able to demonstrate that CTS1 RNA was replicated in the transfected cells. It was replicated to the same level as another DI RNA (CTS253) which has only the 3' 279 nucleotides of the binding domain and these are located near the 3' terminus of the RNA. CTS253 bound capsid protein to an intermediate level but was amplified on passaging. The binding studies and the in vivo packaging data, taken together, provide strong support for the conclusion that there is a specific capsid recognition domain in Sindbis virus RNA that plays a role in nucleocapsid assembly.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
