The resulting nucleotide sequences were converted to protein sequence and were compared to previously sequenced glycoprotein genes with amino acid differences in the glycoproteins of isolates expressing different phenotypes. The HN glycoprotein, involved in the attachment and release of the virus, and the F glycoprotein, involved in penetration and spread of the virus, have been shown to affect pathogenicity of the virus and are the immunodominant proteins of the virus. Both the F and HN proteins have been shown to be required for syncytium formation. Our results suggest that BPIV3 viruses that exhibit greater syncytium-inducing activity in vitro have greater pathogenicity in vivo. By determining which epitopes are involved in syncytium formation and comparing the sequences and enzymatic activities of different strains of virus, it may be possible to design subunit vaccines that protect against disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
