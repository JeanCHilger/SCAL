The 12 isolates produced clear-cut plaques in BSC-1 cells and, except for one isolate, agglutinated human group "O" erythrocytes to an higher titer than bovine erythrocytes. Antisera to each isolate were produced in rabbits and used to study their antigenic relationships. All the isolates shared the group-specific immunofluorescent antigen and were antigenically related as demonstrated by the seroneutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition tests. However, the relationships to the Nebraska rotavirus was quite weak in cases of two Quebec isolates. When the genomes of the various isolates were compared by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, at least three different reproducible fractionation patterns could be identified.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
