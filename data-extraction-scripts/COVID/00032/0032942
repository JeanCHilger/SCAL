Digestion of virus in vitro with chymotrypsin or trypsin reveals two distinct forms of ISVPs, while the predominant species of ISVPs found in the small intestinal lumen appears to be identical to the chymotrypsin product. The in vivo conversion of virions to ISVPs was blocked by pretreatment of mice with protease inhibitors, resulting in inefficient replication of reovirus in intestinal tissue. The early inhibition of viral replication in suckling mice pretreated with protease inhibitors was not observed when suckling mice were inoculated with ISVPs generated by in vitro digestion with either chymotrypsin or trypsin. However, replication was decreased during secondary rounds of replication in mice receiving repeated doses of protease inhibitors, suggesting that luminal proteolytic digestion is important in rendering progeny virions infectious in the gut.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
