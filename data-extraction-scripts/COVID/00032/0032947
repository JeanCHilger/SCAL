The 11.7-kb SIN genome was transcribed in vitro as two nonoverlapping RNA fragments. RNA-1 contained the entire 11.4-kb protein coding sequence of SIN and also carried an additional 1.8-kb nonviral sequence at its 3' end. RNA-2 carried the remaining 0.26 or 0.3 kb of the SIN genome containing the 3'NTR. Transfection of these two fragments into BHK cells resulted in vivo RNA-RNA recombination and release of infectious SIN recombinants. Eighteen plaque-purified recombinant viruses were sequenced to precisely map the RNA-RNA crossover sites at the 3'NTR. Sixteen of the 18 recombinants were found to be genetically heterogeneous at the 3'NTR. Two major clustered sites within the 3'NTR of RNA-2 were found to be fused to multiple locations on the nonviral sequence of RNA-1, resulting in insertions of 10 to 1,085 nucleotides at the 3'NTR. Sequence analysis of crossover sites suggested only limited homology and heteroduplex-forming capability between substrate RNAs. Analysis of additional 23 recombinant viruses generated by mutagenized donor and acceptor templates supports the occurrence of recombination hot spots on donor templates. Introduction of a 17-nucleotide rudimentary replicase recognition signal in the acceptor template alone did not induce the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide signal. Interestingly, deletion of a 24-nucleotide hot spot locus on the donor template abolished crossover events at one of the two sites and allowed the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide replicase recognition signal inserted at the acceptor template. The possible roles of RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions in the differential regulation of apparent pausing, template selection, and reinitiation are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
