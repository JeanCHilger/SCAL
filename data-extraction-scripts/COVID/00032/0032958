The severity of dehydration, hypothermia, and metabolic acidosis were associated with level of depression. Clinical signs and age of calf could be used to predict the severity of acidosis. Acidosis was more severe in calves over eight days of age and also increased in severity with the degree of depression. The most severe metabolic acidosis was seen in calves over eight days of age presented in sternal or lateral recumbency; the base deficit in these groups was 16.3 ± 8.3 (means ± 1SD) and 20.3 ± 10.1 mmol/L respectively, and on average these calves require 2.4 and 3.0 L respectively of 1.3% sodium bicarbonate solution to correct the acidosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
