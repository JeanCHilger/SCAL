<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1974-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Differentiation of Four Adenovirus Types by Macrophage Migration Inhibition Tests</TITLE><BODY>The macrophage migration inhibition (MMI) test was found to be a satisfactory procedure for distinguishing between adenovirus types 1, 4, 5, and 7. Highly purified virus preparations were used for the sensitization of Hartley strain guinea pigs, whereas the MMI test antigen consisted of crude virus preparations grown in KB cells. With all four virus types, a significantly greater MMI response was noted when peritoneal exudate cells were exposed to the homologous sensitizing antigen as compared to that obtained with the three heterologous antigens. Studies with adenovirus type 1 indicate that sensitizing doses between 70 and 150 μg of viral protein per guinea pig gave the optimal MMI response. Doses below 70 μg did not stimulate the delayed response, whereas doses above 120 μg produced MMI reactions which were nonspecific, as differences between homologous and heterologous antigens were not demonstrable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
