Ohtsuka, Y. K. Yamada, and F. Taguchi, J. Gen. Virol. 77:1683-1992, 1996). This fact indicates the possibility that the difference in MHV susceptibility between BALB/c and SJL mice is determined by the virus-binding activity of the receptor. To test this possibility, we have examined MHV susceptibility in mice with the homozygous MHVR1 gene (R1/R1 genotype), mice with the MHVR1 and MHVR2 genes (R1/R2 genotype), and mice with the homozygous MHVR2 gene (R2/R2 genotype) produced by cross and backcross mating between BALB/c and SJL mice. All 63 F2 and backcrossed mice with the MHVR1 gene (R1/R1 and R1/R2) were susceptible to MHV infection, and all 57 with the homozygous MHVR2 gene (R2/R2) were resistant. We have also examined the MHV receptor genotypes of several mouse strains that were reported to be susceptible to MHV infection. All of those mice had the MHVR1 gene. These results suggest the possibility that the viral receptor determines the susceptibility of the whole animal to MHV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
