Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated astrocytes produced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis using a mouse TNF probe and by functional assay. Biological activity of rat astrocyte-derived TNF was neutralized by rabbit antiserum against recombinant murine TNF. Stimulation of astrocytes by lipopolysaccharide also activated the interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 genes. We have also investigated whether a neurotropic paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus, triggers cytokine production by astrocytes. This virus induced astrocytes to produce TNF, lymphotoxin, interleukin 6, and alpha- and beta-interferons. Thus, stimulation by endotoxin and virus activated distinct, yet overlapping, sets of cytokine genes. We propose that astrocytes and the cytokines they produce may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of immunologically and/or virally mediated CNS disease, in CNS intercellular communication, and in the interactions between the nervous and immune systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
