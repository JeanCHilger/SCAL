Production of viral protein was detected by electrophoretic analysis in polyacrylamide gels by using a double-label coelectrophoresis and subtraction method which eliminated the contribution of host protein components from the profiles of virus-infected cytoplasm. Eleven virus-specified proteins were detected in the net electrophoretic profiles of hepatitis A virus-infected cells. The molecular weights of these proteins were very similar to those detected in cells infected with poliovirus type 1. Virus-specified protein synthesis could be detected at 3 to 6 h and continued for at least 48 h postinfection, but no significant effect on host-cell macromolecular synthesis was observed. Limited viral RNA replication occurred between 2 and 6 h postinfection. The genomic RNA of hepatitis A virus was extracted and shown to be capable of infecting cells and inducing the same set of proteins as intact virus, indicating that the RNA genome is positive stranded. Progeny virus was never detected in the supernatant fluids of infected cell cultures, and the cells showed no observable cytopathology, even though hepatitis A virus-specific proteins and antigens were being produced. The nature of the defect in the replicative cycle of hepatitis A virus in this system remains unknown.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
