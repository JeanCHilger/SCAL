TNF-alpha-positive cells were present in the central nervous system during infection; however, TNF-alpha could not be colocalized with JHMV-infected cells. In vitro, TNF-alpha mRNA rapidly accumulated following JHMV infection; however, no TNF-alpha was secreted because of inhibition of translation. Both live and UV-inactivated virus inhibited TNF-alpha secretion induced by lipopolysaccharide. These data show that TNF-alpha is not secreted from infected cells and indicate that if contributes to either JHMV-induced acute encephalomyelitis nor primary demyelination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
