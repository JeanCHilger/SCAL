Tissues from the heart and lungs of 92 calves dying with myocarditis in Alberta feedlots were immunohistochemically stained for the antigens of these agents. Tissues from 44 calves dying from noninfectious causes and 35 calves dying with pneumonia were tested as controls. Hemophilus somnus was found in cardiac lesions in the majority of myocarditis cases (70/92). Mycoplasma bovis was concurrently demonstrated in the hearts of 4/92 affected calves. No bacterial pathogens were found in heart tissues from the control groups of calves. Bovine viral diarrhea virus was demonstrated in the tissues of 4/92 myocarditis cases compared with those of 13/35 calves dying from pneumonia and 0/44 calves dying from noninfectious causes. The results demonstrate that H. somnus is the principle pathogen associated with myocarditis in feedlot calves and that the presence of BVDV is more common in these calves compared with calves dying of noninfectious causes. The findings also suggest that BVDV is an important pathogen in calves dying with gross postmortem lesions of pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
