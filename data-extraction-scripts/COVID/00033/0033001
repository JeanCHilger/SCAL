Analyses of the amino acid sequence with respect to hydropathicity and secondary structure yielded a two-dimensional model of the protein. The model predicts an N-terminal, 29-amino-acid cleavable signal sequence, a 696-amino-acid hydrophilic surface domain containing six potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, a 69-amino-acid hydrophobic domain containing three segments traversing the membrane, and a charged 109-amino-acid domain projecting into the cytoplasm and previously shown to marker rescue glycoprotein B syn mutations. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant glycoprotein B DNA fragments previously shown to marker transfer or rescue the mutations revealed that the amino acid substitutions cluster in the hydrophilic surface domain between amino acids 273 and 305. Analyses of the secondary structure of these regions, coupled with the experimentally derived observation that the H126-5- and H233-antibody cognitive sites do not overlap, indicate the approximate locations of the epitopes of these neutralizing, surface-reacting, and immune-precipitating monoclonal antibodies. The predicted perturbations in the secondary structure introduced by the amino acid substitutions correlate with the extent of loss of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies in various immunoassays.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
