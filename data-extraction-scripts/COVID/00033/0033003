The results indicate that transgenic soluble CTLA4 does not significantly alter cytotoxic T-cell responses against replicating lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or vaccinia virus but drastically impairs the induction of cytotoxic T-cell responses against abortively replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). While the T-independent neutralizing immunoglobulin M (IgM) responses were within normal ranges, the switch to IgG was reduced 4- to 16-fold after immunization with abortively replicating VSV and more than 30-fold after immunization with an inert VSV glycoprotein antigen in transgenic mice. IgG antibody responses to LCMV, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by neutralizing action, were reduced about 3- to 20-fold and more than 50-fold, respectively. These results suggest that responses in CTLA4-Ig tg mice are mounted according to their independence of T help. While immune responses to nonreplicating or poorly replicating antigens are in general most dependent on T help and B7-CD28 interactions, they are most impaired in CTLA4-Ig tg mice. The results of the present experiments also indicate that highly replicating viruses, because of greater quantities of available antigens and by inducing as-yet-undefined factors and/or cell surface changes, are capable of compensating for the decrease in T help caused by the blocking effects of soluble CTLA4.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
