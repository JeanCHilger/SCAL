The 6-halogenated analogs produced 99% reductions in progeny virion yields at concentrations as low as 0.004 micrograms/ml. However, these analogs perturbated HeLa cell metabolism at lower concentrations (at or above 5 micrograms/ml) than did the 6-methylsulfonyl analog (at or above 20 micrograms/ml). Compound MDL 20,610 was also active against human, simian, and bovine rotaviruses (cytopathic effect IC1/2s of 0.8 to 1.5 micrograms/ml) and possessed variable enterovirus and paramyxovirus activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
