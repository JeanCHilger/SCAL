The parainfluenza virus was administered 7 days after Hong Kong/68-ts-1 [E] virus infection. The clinical response, daily quantitative virus shedding, interferon production, and serum and nasal wash antibody responses were determined in an experimental group (influenza A virus followed by parainfluenza virus) and 10 volunteers in a control group (parainfluenza virus only). The volunteers were selected on the basis of susceptibility to the two viruses, i.e. serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer of is less than or greater to 1:8 for influenza virus and low nasal wash antibody titer (is less than or greater to 1:8) for parainfluenza virus. Despite a 100% infection rate in the Hong Kong/68-ts-1 [E] vaccinees, no heterologous interference was induced against the parainfluenza type 1 virus challenge.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
