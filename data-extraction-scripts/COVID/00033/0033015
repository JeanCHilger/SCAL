Pigs were given serum with their daily ration of milk, and their immunity to virulent TGEV was determined. The pigs were observed for ten days for clinical signs of TGEV infection. One of nine pigs receiving goat serum was protected whereas all three pigs receiving three doses of swine serum per day were protected. Because virus was not isolated from the goats after oral/intranasal vaccination, it is suggested the virus did not replicate in either the respiratory or digestive tract of the goat.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
