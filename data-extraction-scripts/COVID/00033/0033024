The sensitivity of the panel was 88% for detection of culture-proven nocardial infections, and specificity was 85% (excluding cross-reactive leprosy cases). In part 2, no difference in seropositivity was found when PD patients were compared with their age- and gender-matched controls (n = 140). We found a high exposure rate of humans to nocardial antigens, especially among men and older individuals. Our results offer no support to the hypothesis that Nocardia spp. are causative in PD; however, it is possible that serological testing may not be optimal for detection of nocardial central nervous system infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
