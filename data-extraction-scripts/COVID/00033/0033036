The slippery sequence of HTLV-2 is sufficient to dictate a basal level of frameshifting. This level is enhanced by its upstream sequence context and by the downstream stem-loop structure which is located at an optimal distance of 7 bases. Frameshifting in human immunodeficiency virus gag-pol is similar to that of HTLV-2 gag-pro. However, experiments using hybrid cassettes of HTLV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 frameshift elements show that while the slippery sequence of HTLV-2 is less efficient, the stem-loop structure is a more efficient enhancer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
