An assay in which plates were coated with three pooled MAbs and biotinylated polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) (polyclonal antibody [PAb]) was used as the detector (MAb capture-PAb detector) was found to be the most sensitive and specific of the assays when it was compared with assays in which plates were coated with polyclonal antiserum and detection was done with either biotinylated polyclonal antiserum (PAb capture-PAb detector) or biotinylated pooled MAbs (PAb capture-MAb detector). The MAb capture-PAb detector ELISA detected 83% of samples confirmed to be positive for group C rotaviruses, whereas the PAb capture-PAb detector assay detected 63% of positive samples and the PAb capture-MAb detector assay detected 65% of positive samples. All three procedures detected both of the bovine and the two human group C rotaviruses, but none of the three procedures detected fecal samples containing group A and B rotaviruses or fecal samples negative for group C rotaviruses used in this study. The sensitivity of the MAb capture-PAb detector ELISA was determined by serially diluting fecal group C rotaviruses; antigens were detected in maximal positive dilution ranges of 1:1,000 to 1:3,000 for the samples tested. On the basis of the cell culture immunofluorescence assay infectivity titer of semipurified cell culture-passaged Cowden group C rotavirus, the sensitivity of the MAb capture-PAb detection ELISA for detection of homologous group C rotavirus was 53 fluorescent focus units per ml. Epitope mapping by use of the biotinylated MAbs in competition assay suggested that our MAbs may bind to three different but overlapping epitopes. These results suggest that the MAb capture-PAb detector ELISA can be used to study the epidemiology of group C rotaviruses in humans and animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
