These CD4+ clones respond to the promiscuous peptide fragment S-329-343 of the glycoprotein S of MHV-A59. The results indicate that the core peptides of both clones overlap but are not identical. The core region of the HS1 clone is an 8-mer, and comprises the amino acid residues S-332-339, whereas the minimal epitope for clone B6.1 is a 9-mer and comprises the amino acid residues S-334-342. The peptide fragment S-329-343 activates all T-cell effector functions, including proliferation, cytokine secretion and cytolysis. However, in the present study we show that T-cell activation is not an all-or-none phenomenon, in which T-cell stimulation leads to activation of all T-cell effector functions. It appears that changes in the length of a peptide ligand can differentially activate the cytolytic machinery from proliferation and cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the results indicate that, in our case, modulation of the flanking residues of the core epitopes did not convert the cytokine profile of polarized T-helper type-1 (Th1) clones into a Th2-type pattern.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
