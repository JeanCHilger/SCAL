<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1985</DATELINE><TITLE>Progress in enzyme immunoassays: production of reagents, experimental design, and interpretation</TITLE><BODY>Enzyme immunoassays represent in many cases the preferred procedure for the detection of antigens or corresponding antibodies. However, many of the current procedures are performed suboptimally. This article reviews the available designs, auxiliary recognition systems, production and purification of antibodies, conjugation procedures, solid-phase materials, recording and interpretation of results, and quality control and standardization of procedures to improve the reproducibility of tests.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
