<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1996-11-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Polycistronic (tri- or bicistronic) phytoreoviral segments translatable in both plant and insect cells.</TITLE><BODY>Genomic segment S12 of rice dwarf virus and segment S9 of wound tumor virus, both members of the genus Phytoreovirus, have small out-of-phase overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed that rice dwarf virus S12 mRNA specified translation products from the large ORF and two overlapping small ORFs both in rice plant hosts and in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells. These results provide the first example of a tricistronic mRNA for a segmented double-stranded RNA virus. Similarly, wound tumor virus S9 mRNA was found to direct the synthesis of protein products from both the large ORF and small out-of-frame ORF in S. frugiperda cells. Results of site-specific and deletion mutagenesis studies were consistent with a leaky scanning translation mechanism for the synthesis of the small ORFs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
