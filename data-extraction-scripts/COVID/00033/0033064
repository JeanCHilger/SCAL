Each serum sample was tested by indirect immunofluorescence on PCV-free PK15 cells, on PCV1-infected PK15 cells and on PCV2-infected PK15 cells. For the 3 years studied, sera positive to PCV1 and PCV2 were identified and the number of sera positive for PCV2 was greater than the number of sera positive for PCV1. The results indicated 1) that PCV2 appears to be the main PCV type circulating in the Canadian pig population, 2) that PCV2 had been circulating in the Canadian pig population at least 10 years before the postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) was reported, and 3) that serological evaluation using PCV1 underestimates the seroprevalence of PCV2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
