N. Woode, N. E. Kelso, T. F. Simpson, S. K. Gaul, L. E. Evans, and L. Babiuk, J. Clin. Microbiol. 18:358-364, 1983). Three viruses belonging to two different serotype groups were used as vaccines in gnotobiotic calves, which were subsequently challenged with B641 or B223, representing the two bovine serotypes. In the present work, the experiments were repeated with more calves and the specificity of their antibody responses was measured and compared with the results of the protection studies. Protection between different serotypes occurred under both homologous and heterologous conditions but was not directly serotype dependent. B223 virus showed both homologous and heterologous protection against B223 and B641 challenge viruses. This was a one-way reaction, as B641 did not induce protection against B223. Neonatal calf diarrhea virus vaccine produced neither homologous (against B641) nor heterologous (against B223) protection. The plaque reduction neutralization titers of serum antibody and coproantibody did not predict a state of protection against the challenge virus. Calves vaccinated with neonatal calf diarrhea virus or B641 developed neutralizing antibodies to their respective heterologous challenge viruses but were not protected. After challenge, the boosted coproantibody plaque reduction neutralization response to the original vaccine virus was greater than that to the challenge virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
