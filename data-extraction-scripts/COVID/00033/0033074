The treatments were either a conventional oral electrolyte containing glycine (40 mmol/L) as the amino acid, an oral electrolyte in which glutamine (40 mmol/L) replaced glycine or an electrolyte in which high concentrations of glutamine (400 mmol/L) replaced glycine. The calves were monitored while on trial and at the end of the treatment they were euthanized and a necropsy was immediately performed. Calves fed the high glutamine electrolyte had more treatment failures (2/7 versus 0/7 for each of the other 2 treatments). There was a significant effect of type of electrolyte on fecal consistency. Calves fed the glycine containing electrolyte had the most solid feces. Duodenal villus height was significantly affected by the type of electrolyte: values (mean +/- 1 SEM) were 0.61 +/- 0.09, 0.46 +/- 0.05, and 0.59 +/- 0.07 mm for high glutamine, low glutamine and glycine electrolytes respectively. There was no significant difference in small intestinal surface area between groups. High glutamine treated calves had the greatest capacity to absorb xylose from the small intestine but this difference was not statistically significant. Overall, this trial does not suggest that substituting glutamine for glycine in oral electrolyte solutions improves treatment of diarrheic calves or speeds mucosal healing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
