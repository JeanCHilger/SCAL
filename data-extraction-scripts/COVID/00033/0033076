By studying the behavior of wild-type and mutant variants of the polyprotein, we show that the signal sequences responsible for membrane translocation of the 6K and E1 proteins reside in the C-terminal regions of p62 and 6K, respectively. We present evidence suggesting that the polyprotein is processed on the luminal side by signal peptidase at consensus cleavage sites immediately following the signal sequences. Our results also lead us to conclude that the 6K protein is a transmembrane polypeptide with its N terminus on the luminal side of the membrane (type I). Thus, the production of all three membrane proteins is directed by alternating signal and stop-transfer (anchor) sequences that function in translocation and cleavage of the virus precursor polyprotein. This also shows conclusively that internally located signal sequences can be cleaved by signal peptidase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
