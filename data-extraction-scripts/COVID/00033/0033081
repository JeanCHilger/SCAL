Humoral and cellular immune responses both participate in controlling the development of chronic MHV-induced demyelination. A subset of the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) induced by immunization of BALB/c (H-2d) mice with JHMV is specific for the viral nucleocapsid protein. This CTL population recognizes an epitope located within the carboxy-terminal 149 amino acids in association with the Ld class I molecule (S. A. Stohlman, S. Kyuwa, M. Cohen, C. Bergmann, J. P. Polo, J. Yeh, R. Anthony, and J. G. Keck, Virology 189:217-224, 1992). Using a panel of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing truncated forms of the nucleocapsid protein and a series of overlapping synthetic peptides, we mapped the response to 15 amino acids. This sequence, encompassing the MHV epitope, contains the Ld-specific binding motif. The predicted 9-mer peptide (residues 318 to 326: APTAGAFFF) was sufficient and highly active in sensitizing target cells for CTL recognition when either added exogenously or synthesized intracellularly. Cross-reactivity of JHMV nucleocapsid protein-specific CTL with six other MHV strains indicated that natural sequence variations within the 9-mer epitope are tolerated in positions 4 and 5, whereas all other amino acids are conserved. These data define a novel 9-mer Ld-restricted CTL epitope which represents the first MHV CTL epitope. Characterization of this epitope provides a molecular basis to study the role of nucleocapsid protein-specific CTL in the clearance of JHMV from the central nervous system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
