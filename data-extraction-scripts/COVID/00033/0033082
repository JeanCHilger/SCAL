<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1994-05-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Why is CpG suppressed in the genomes of virtually all small eukaryotic viruses but not in those of large eukaryotic viruses?</TITLE><BODY>Dinucleotide over- and underrepresentation is evaluated in all available completely sequenced DNA or RNA viral genomes, ranging in size from 3 to 250 kb (available RNA viruses fall into the small-virus category). The dinucleotide CpG is statistically underrepresented (suppressed) in all but four of the small viruses (more than 75 with lengths of < 30 kb) but has normal relative abundances in most large viruses (> or = 30 kb). Most retrotransposons in eukaryotic species also show low CpG relative abundances. Interpretations, especially in some cases of DNA viruses or viruses with a DNA intermediate, might relate to methylation effects and modes of viral integration and excision. Other possible contributing factors relate to dinucleotide stacking energies, special mutation mechanisms, and evolutionary events.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
