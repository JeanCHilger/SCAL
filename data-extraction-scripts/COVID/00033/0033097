To determine whether deficits in B or T cells or in interferon γ on a B6 background increased the duration of MPV shedding or transmission, B-cell–deficient (Igh), interferon-γ–deficient (Ifnγ), B- and T-cell–deficient (Rag), and B6 mice were inoculated with MPV. At 1 and 2 wk postinoculation (wpi), 11% to 94% of mice shed MPV. From 4 to 18 wpi, 80% to 100% of Rag mice and 0% of B6 and Ifnγ mice shed MPV; Igh mice sporadically shed MPV through 20 wpi. MPV was transmitted from B6 mice and Ifnγ mice at 2 to 4 wpi. Rag and Igh mice transmitted MPV to sentinels at all or most time points, respectively, between 2 to 16 wpi. Once transmission ceased from B6, Ifnγ, and Igh mice, breeding trios were setup and showed that MPV was transmitted to offspring in only one cage of Igh mice. In another experiment, MPV shedding ceased from B6, CD8-deficient (CD8), CD4-deficient (CD4), and T-cell–receptor-deficient (TCR) mice by 2, 6, 8, and 8 wpi, respectively. MPV was transmitted to sentinels only at 1 to 4 wpi. Mesenteric lymph nodes collected from 61% to 100% of B6, Ifnγ, TCR, CD4, CD8, and Rag mice were MPV DNA-positive. In conclusion, MPV transmission did not differ between mice deficient in T cell functions or Ifnγ and B6 mice. In contrast, B-cell deficiency posed an increased risk for MPV transmission in mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
