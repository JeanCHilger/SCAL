The results of the RT-PCR assay were compared with those previously reported with virus cultivation and commercially available rapid diagnostic kits (E.A. Dominguez, L.H. Taber, and R.B. Couch, J. Clin. Microbiol. 31:2286-2290, 1993). With virus cultivation as the "gold standard", the RT-PCR assay had a sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of 95, 98, and 97%, respectively, compared with 75, 100, and 93%, respectively, for the best diagnostic kit (Becton Dickinson Directigen). RT-PCR is an effective alternative to virus isolation for the detection of influenza A virus in clinical specimens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
