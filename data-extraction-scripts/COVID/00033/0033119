A transcription-translation system developed from a nontoxigenic strain of Clostridium tetani was found to yield predominantly full-sized peptides. Such peptides were used to map six different epitopes for eight monoclonal antibodies. The toxin-neutralizing properties of the antibodies were determined in an in vitro assay, based on the toxin-mediated inhibition of norepinephrine release from rat brain particles. Two monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes within the regions Ser-744 to Ser-864 and Ile-1224 to Asp-1315 could neutralize the toxin. A third nonneutralizing antibody was shown to recognize the synthetic peptide Phe-947 to Glu-967 derived from the tetanus toxin sequence. This peptide contains a human T-cell epitope.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
