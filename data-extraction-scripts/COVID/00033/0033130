The calici-like virus (Newbury agent SRV-1) caused anorexia, diarrhea, and xylose malabsorption in gnotobiotic calves aged 17 to 60 days, whereas the bovine astrovirus was nonpathogenic in similar calves. The calici-like virus was shown to be antigenically distinct from a previously described isolate (Newbury agent SRV-2) by two-way cross-protection experiments in calves; calves immune to homologous challenge became clinically ill and excreted virus when challenged with the heterologous virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
