Male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were fed a control diet or the diet supplemented with polyphenolic-rich GE (100 or 300 mg/kg daily) for 3 wk prior to intraperitoneal injection of 3 or 15 mg/kg LPS. A fluorometric assay was used to measure serum sPLA(2) activity during a 5-d period before and after LPS injection. Body weight, hematocrit, and serum C-reactive protein level were also measured. Administration of LPS induced a rapid increase in sPLA(2) activity, which peaked 1 to 2 d after LPS injection and resolved to near-baseline values on days 4 to 5. Marked declines in body weight and hematocrit, increases in C-reactive protein levels, and effects on health status also occurred. GE supplementation significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in sPLA(2) activity and decline in hematocrit, but its effects on the loss of body weight and C-reactive protein levels were not significant. Among the measurements, serum sPLA(2) was the only marker that showed a dose-dependent response to both LPS and GE supplementation. The current findings show that oral consumption of polyphenolic-rich GE suppresses endotoxin-induced sPLA(2) activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
