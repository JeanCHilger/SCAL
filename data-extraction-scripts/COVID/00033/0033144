For some viruses, the genome is the only viral mRNA and expression is regulated primarily at the translational level and by limited proteolysis of polyproteins. Other virus groups also generate subgenomic mRNAs later in the reproductive cycle. For nidoviruses, subgenomic mRNA synthesis (transcription) is discontinuous and yields a 5′ and 3′ coterminal nested set of mRNAs. Nidovirus transcription is not essential for genome replication, which relies on the autoprocessing products of two replicase polyproteins that are translated from the genome. We now show that the N-terminal replicase subunit, nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), of the nidovirus equine arteritis virus is in fact dispensable for replication but crucial for transcription, thereby coupling replicase expression and subgenomic mRNA synthesis in an unprecedented manner. Nsp1 is composed of two papain-like protease domains and a predicted N-terminal zinc finger, which was implicated in transcription by site-directed mutagenesis. The structural integrity of nsp1 is essential, suggesting that the protease domains form a platform for the zinc finger to operate in transcription.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
