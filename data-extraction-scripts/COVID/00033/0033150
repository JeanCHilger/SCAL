Such studies usually require the parental antigens. We attempted to profile the immune responses in patients with breast cancer using a peptide phage display selection strategy, which identifies antibody specificities whether or not the antigens are known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A panel of random peptide phage libraries was panned on serum IgG antibodies from breast cancer patients with stage IV, seeking for disease specific IgG epitopes. ELISA, immunoscreening, and Western blotting techniques were the main approaches used. RESULTS: Phage-displayed peptides were specifically enriched for binding to IgG antibodies from patients with breast cancer. Several peptides have been identified, in particular the SQRIPARIHHFPTSI peptide, which was recognized by IgG antibodies from breast cancer patients, but not from normals (p < 0.0004). In patients who responded to the selected peptides, in particular the SQRIPARIHHFPTSI peptide, antibodies against a 66 kDa cellular protein were found. Interestingly, three out of six patients with the strongest immunoreactivity are still alive, with a mean survival time from first recurrence until now of 2553 days. In contrast, all the nonresponders (n = 10) are deceased. The mean survival time of these patients was 784 days, whereas the mean survival time of the three deceased responders was 1050 days (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The data provide the first example in which panning of peptide phage display libraries on patient IgG antibodies results in the isolation of breast cancer specific IgG epitopes, some of which correlate with patient survival time. Thus, the identified B-cell epitopes should be of great interest in vaccine development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
