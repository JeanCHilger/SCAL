<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-07-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Q fever endocarditis: A case report and review of the literature</TITLE><BODY>The case of a 31-year-old man from Alberta diagnosed with Q fever endocarditis is presented. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first case of Q fever endocarditis diagnosed in the province of Alberta. The patient had undergone open valvulotomy for congenital aortic stenosis as an infant. He presented with congestive heart failure secondary to severe aortic regurgitation and underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement. Early failure of the mechanical prosthesis and numerous laboratory abnormalities prompted an investigation for endocarditis, which was initially negative. Markedly positive serology eventually established the diagnosis of chronic Q fever. The patient subsequently underwent a second aortic valve replacement following initiation of appropriate antimicrobials directed against Coxiella burnetii. The present report reviews the clinical presentation and diagnosis of Q fever endocarditis. It highlights the insidious and nonspecific nature of the presenting symptoms, and emphasizes the use of serology for diagnosis. Increased awareness and earlier diagnosis can significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
