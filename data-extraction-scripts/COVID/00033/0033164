<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1984-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Antibody against viruses in maternal and cord sera: non-specific inhibitors are found to higher titre on the maternal side of the circulation.</TITLE><BODY>Pregnancies were identified in which maternal IgG antibodies against rubella virus were not detectable by single radial haemolysis. Twenty paired maternal/cord sera were then tested for haemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) activity against rubella virus without kaolin pretreatment of the sera. In the absence of specific antibody, the HI activity observed could thus be ascribed to the effect of non-specific inhibitors. The HI activity in maternal sera was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than that in cord sera. The 20 pairs of sera were similarly tested against a bunyavirus, an alphavirus and a flavivirus, both with and without kaolin pretreatment. The results showed non-specific inhibitors were found to higher titre in maternal sera, with the difference being statistically significant (P less than 0.001) for each of the three viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
