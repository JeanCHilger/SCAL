However, this decline was not observed when these antibodies were measured by haemagglutination-inhibition (HI). It has been postulated that this discrepancy is due to the acquisition, in the early days of life, of non-specific serum factors which increase the HI activity of sera. The levels of these factors were determined indirectly by calculating HI:CF ratios and it was shown that the factors are rapidly acquired by children between the fifth and twentieth week of life.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
