Seven novel species of single-stranded polyadenylic acid-containing defective RNAs were identified from passages 3 through 22. The largest of these RNAs, DIssA (molecular weight [mw], 5.2 X 10(6)), is identical to the genomic RNA packaged in the defective interfering particles produced from these cells. Other RNA species, DIssB1 (mw, 1.9 X 10(6) to 1.6 X 10(6)), DIssB2 (mw, 1.6 X 10(6)), DIssC (mw, 2.8 X 10(6)) DIssD (mw, 0.82 X 10(6)), DIssE (mw, 0.78 X 10(6)), and DIssF (mw, 1.3 X 10(6)) were detected at different passage levels. RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotide fingerprinting demonstrated that all these RNAs were related and had multiple deletions of the genomic sequences. They contained different subsets of the genomic sequences from those of the standard intracellular mRNAs of nondefective mouse hepatitis virus JHM strain. Thus these novel intracellular viral RNAs were identified as defective interfering RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus JHM strain. The synthesis of six of the seven normal mRNA species specific to mouse hepatitis virus JHM strain was completely inhibited when cells were infected with viruses of late-passage levels. However, the synthesis of RNA7 and its product, viral nucleoprotein, was not significantly altered in late passages. The possible mechanism for the generation of defective interfering RNAs was discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
