These antibodies and our panel of anti-p80/125 monoclonal antibodies were tested for their cross-reactivity with 11 different North American and European (Danish) BVDV strains and isolates including viruses of both cytopathic and noncytopathic biotypes. The four anti-gp53 monoclonal antibodies were neutralizing for the homologous Danish cytopathic isolate and cross-reacted with all BVDV strains examined except for the Draper strain. Further, anti-gp53 monoclonal antibodies neutralized the majority of BVDV strains examined. The anti-p80/125 monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with all eleven strains and isolates tested. This indicated that various strains of BVDV have common epitopes. The broad cross-reactivities demonstrated by these monoclonal antibodies suggest that a pool of these antibodies may be used for detection of BVDV cellular contamination or for virus isolation, in place of polyclonal antiserum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
