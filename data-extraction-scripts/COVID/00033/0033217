This reagent selectively recognizes human benign and malignant intestinal T lymphocytes, but not benign or malignant lymph node T cells. In all cases, the majority of nonepithelium-associated T cells present in the corium were HML-1 negative. In the eight cases with marked epidermotropism, the intraepidermal (IED) T cells were HML-1 positive in three cases, and HML-1 negative in the remaining five cases. The HML-1 positive IED T cells tended to be localized preferentially in the basal layers, whereas the HML-1 negative IED T cells were more diffusely distributed throughout all epidermal cell layers or formed intra-epidermal aggregates. These findings provide further evidence that mycosis fungoides is not a single entity, but represents a group of neoplasms originating from different T cell subsets that have in common their tropism to epidermis and/or dermis, and thus have a similar clinical presentation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
