The descending portion of the duodenum of six Holstein calves less than 24 hours old was cannulated. The calves were fed milk except on days 5, 6 and 7 when they were given the same volume of an electrolyte solution. Sequential biopsy specimens of the proximal jejunal mucosa were obtained for three weeks and the lactase activity determined. Lactase activity was highest on day 1 and a trend toward decreased lactase activity from birth until three weeks was observed. Mean lactase activity was significantly (p less than 0.05) higher for days 1, and 3 compared to days 9, 13 and 17. The withdrawal of milk and replacement by an electrolyte solution during three days had no significant effect on jejunal mucosal lactase activity in neonatal calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
