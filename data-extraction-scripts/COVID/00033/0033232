No cross-reactivity was observed in these negative control species using LAMP assay. The lower detection limit of LAMP assay was approximately 10(3) copies. 25 cases (20.8%) were detected at least one positive bacteria species by conventional sputum culturing method, while 73 cases (60.8%) were tested positive in LAMP assay. Moreover, compared with sputum culture, bacterial titers results of LAMP assay were more consistent with FEV(1)/FVC value of AECOPD patients. These results indicated that the sensitivity of LAMP assay was significantly higher than that of sputum culturing method.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
