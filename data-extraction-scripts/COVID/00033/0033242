TGE field virus strains did not replicate as well as attenuated strains at 37 C and could not be passaged serially for more than four to six passages at 33 C. There were clear differences in plaque size when the strains were compared. Field strains had average plaque sizes ranging from 3.59 to 3.15 mm, whereas attenuated strains induced plaques that were larger than 4.2 mm. Variations were observed in stability of strains at pH 3.0. Field strains and cell culture-attenuated strains CKp-270 and SH-114 were reduced in titer by about 1 log10. A reduction of about 3 log10, however, was obtained with cell culture strains B1-300 and Purdue-113.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
