In contrast, one particular human H5N1 virus was nonlethal in mice and showed no evidence of systemic spread. To compare H5N1 viruses of varying pathogenicity for their ability to alter the mammalian immune system, mice were infected with either influenza A/Hong Kong/483/97 (HK/483) (lethal) or A/Hong Kong/486/97 (HK/486) (nonlethal) virus and monitored for lymphocyte depletion in the blood, lungs, and lymphoid tissue. Intranasal infection with HK/483 resulted in a significant decrease in the total number of circulating leukocytes evident as early as day 2 postinfection. Differential blood counts demonstrated up to an 80% drop in lymphocytes by day 4 postinfection. In contrast, nonlethal HK/486-infected mice displayed only a transient drop of lymphocytes during the infectious period. Analysis of lung and lymphoid tissue from HK/483-infected mice demonstrated a reduction in the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and reduced synthesis of the cytokines interleukin-1Î² and gamma interferon and the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein compared with HK/486-infected mice. In contrast, the cytokine and chemokine levels were increased in the brains of mice infected with HK/483 but not HK/486. Evidence of apoptosis in the spleen and lung of HK/483-infected mice was detected in situ, suggesting a mechanism for lymphocyte destruction. These results suggest that destructive effects on the immune system may be one factor that contributes to the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses in mammalian hosts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
