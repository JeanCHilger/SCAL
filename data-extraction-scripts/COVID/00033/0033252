In this study, we have analyzed the sequence requirements for read-through suppression by placing different portions of wild-type and mutant viral sequences from the gag-pol junction between reporter genes and testing transcripts of these constructs for suppression in reticulocyte lysates. We find that the read-through signal is contained within the first 57 nucleotides on the 3' side of the UAG codon. Our results indicate that the identities of six conserved bases in the eight-nucleotide, purine-rich sequence immediately downstream of the UAG codon are critical for suppression, as is the existence of a pseudoknot structure spanning the next 49 nucleotides. Thus, read-through suppression depends on a complex, bipartite signal in the mRNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
