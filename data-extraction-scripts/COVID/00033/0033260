Antibody synthesis was found against all of the antigens in at least a few of the MS patients. The highest number of patients had intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to measles, rubella and paramyxo type viruses and the lowest frequency was against M. pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus and cytomegalovirus antigens. Simultaneous antibody synthesis occurred against 1-11 different antigens in these patients. When the summation of different antibody specificities synthesized intrathecally was compared to the CSF-IgG Index, which measures the intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis, a fairly close correlation was found. The control patients had occasional antibody synthesis but generally only against one single virus antigen. The intrathecal antibody synthesis against viruses did not correlate to the disability of the MS patients. The intrathecal antibody synthesis was not different in younger and older patients or patients with shorter or longer disease duration, suggesting that events leading to intrathecal antibody synthesis may occur relatively early in life in these patients. When presence of Dw2 antigen was compared to different specificities of intrathecally synthesized immunoglobulins, only measles virus antibody synthesis showed correlation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
