The results of in situ hybridization for the detection of TGEV were compared with virus isolation (VI), a fluorescent antibody test (FAT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). VI, FAT, and TEM were tested over a course of time before the in situ hybridization was performed. Positive hybridization signals were detected in duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enterocytes from 21 pigs. Hybridization signals were confined to the cytoplasm. Intestinal specimens from 25 piglets were evaluated by 4 tests. Twenty-one of 25 were positive by in situ hybridization. Of these 21 samples, 5 (24%) were positive for TGEV by all 4 tests, 15 (71%) were positive by FAT, 14 (67%) were positive by VI, and 6 (29%) were positive by TEM. In situ hybridization for the detection of TGEV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues provides a rapid means of confirmation of a histopathological diagnosis of TGEV without virus isolation, or when only formalin-fixed intestinal specimens were available.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
