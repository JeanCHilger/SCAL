The most frequently recognized epitopes on E2 were E2-4 (residues 54 to 74), with 5 of 10 tested T-cell lines responding to it. Two CD4+ cytotoxic T-cell cloned isolated from one T-cell line responded strongly in proliferation assays with peptide E2-4 and were cytotoxic to target cells presenting the E2-4 determinant. Truncated peptides contained within the E2-4 peptide sequence were used to define the T-cell determinants. Results indicated that amino acid residues 54 to 65 were directly involved. Human cell lines with different HLA phenotypes were tested for the capacity to present the antigenic determinants. The results suggested that recognition of peptide E2-4 by T-cell clones was associated with HLA DR7.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
