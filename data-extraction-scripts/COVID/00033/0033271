All isolates were determined to be serotype 3 by reaction with hyperimmune antiserum to the serotype 3 H-2 strain of equine rotavirus. All displayed RNA electrophoretic migration patterns related to that of the H-2 strain but distinct from that of serotype 5 strain H-1. A serologic survey of 184 mares in Kentucky, which was done to determine the incidence of H-1 and H-2 infections, showed geometric mean serum neutralizing titers to the H-2 strain of equine rotavirus to be significantly higher than those to the H-1 strain. These data suggest that the serotype 3 H-2 strain is the dominant equine rotavirus in Kentucky and perhaps elsewhere in the United States. We were unable to produce confirmational evidence that the H-1 strain occurs as a natural infection in the United States.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
