Infrequently, hepatocytes arise that do not express uPA, due to physical loss of transgene DNA, and these cells clonally repopulate the entire liver within 3 months of birth. Surprisingly, hepatic tumors appear in these mice beginning at 8 months of age despite the fact that uPA is not oncogenic or genotoxic. Analysis of the transgene locus reveals that tumors arise only from a particular subclass of transgene-deficient cells in which the entire transgene array, and possibly a significant amount of flanking DNA, is deleted. Considering that all transgene-deficient regenerative nodules undergo extensive replication but only a subset gives rise to tumors, we propose that loss of genomic DNA, not mitogenesis per se, is a primary carcinogenic determinant in this model of hepatocarcinogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
