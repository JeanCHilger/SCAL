<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1981-04-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Diagnostic des avortements infectieux chez les bovins laitiers.</TITLE><BODY>During a two year period, March 1977 to April 1979, a total of 92 bovine abortions were studied. The cause of abortion was determined in 34.8% of the cases examined. Opportunistic bacteria, the most commonly diagnosed cause of abortion, accounted for 31.2% of the cases. Leptospirosis was associated with 28.1% of the abortions, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and fungi in respectively 15.7%, bovine viral diarrhea in 6.2%. A congenital abnormality accounted for one case (3.1%). In 23 cases (25%), there was no definitive diagnosis, in spite of evidence of experience with pathogen or suggestive findings of pathology, but insufficient evidence to warrant diagnosis. No findings were recorded in 35.8% of the (possibly noninfectious) cases and in only four cases (4.4%), specimens were unsatisfactory for examination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
