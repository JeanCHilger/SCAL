The presence of viral RNA was not always associated with antigen expression. The in situ hybridization revealed that cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons were highly susceptible to JHMV infection during either acute or paralytic disease. In the paralytic disease, Purkinje cell neurons frequently contained viral RNA. This observation suggests that these neurons, and perhaps others, may be repositories for JHMV in rats that undergo prolonged infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
