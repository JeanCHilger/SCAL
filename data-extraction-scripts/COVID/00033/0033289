In this study, the complete S and ORF3 genes of 15 field PEDV isolates in mid-eastern China from 2011 to 2013 were detected and compared with other reference strains. Based on S gene, all of the PEDV strains could be assigned to 3 genogroups. Only 1 isolate, JS120103, belonged to genogroup 1 and showed a close relationship with previous Chinese strains DX and JS-2004-2, European strain CV777, and Korean strain DR13. The other 14 isolates belonged to genogroup 3 and showed a close relationship with other Chinese strains isolated after 2010. The S genes of those isolates were 9 nucleotides longer in length than JS120103 and the other reference strains in genogroup 1, with 15 bp insertion and 6 bp deletion. Homology analyses revealed that all of the Chinese field isolates, except JS120103, are 97.6% to 100% (95.8% to 100%) identical in nucleotide (deduced amino acid) sequence to each other. Meanwhile, based on the ORF3 gene, all of the PEDV isolates could be separated into 3 genogroups. Eleven of the 15 field isolates in this study belonged to genogroup 3 and were 95.8% to 100% identical in nucleotide sequence or 95.6% to 100% in deduced amino acid sequence to each other. Our results indicate that the variant PEDV strain spread wildly in mid-eastern China. This will be useful to take into consideration in the control and prevention of this disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
