<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1983-02-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Sequence of the nucleocapsid gene from murine coronavirus MHV-A59.</TITLE><BODY>The nucleotide sequence of the RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein of coronavirus MHV-A59 has been determined. Copy DNA was prepared from mRNA isolated from virally infected cells, fragmented and cloned in the phage vector M13 mp8 for direct sequence determination. A sequence of 1817 nucleotides, adjacent to the viral poly-A tail, was obtained. It contains a single long open reading frame encoding a protein of mol. wt. 49660, which is enriched in basic residues.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
