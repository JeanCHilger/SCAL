The EAV protease was found to direct an autoproteolytic cleavage at its C terminus which leads to the production of an approximately 30-kDa N-terminal replicase product (nsp1) containing the PCP domain. Amino acid residues Cys-164 and His-230 of the EAV replicase polyprotein were identified as the most likely candidates for the role of PCP catalytic residues. By means of N-terminal sequence analysis of a PCP cleavage product, derived from a bacterial expression system, it was shown that cleavage occurs between Gly-260 and Gly-261. No evidence for PCP-directed cleavages at other positions in the EAV replicase was obtained. In cotranslational and posttranslational trans-cleavage assays, neither EAV nsp1 nor its precursor was able to process the PCP cleavage site in trans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
