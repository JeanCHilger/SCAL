This protein is composed of four variable domains (I to IV) flanked by constant regions. Some of the variable domains contain antigenic determinants that elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against three nonoverlapping epitopes of MOMP were developed. One of these, called DP10, bound to all serovars, as shown by immunoblot analysis, and neutralized chlamydial infectivity for hamster kidney (HaK) cells in a complement-independent in vitro assay. Furthermore, analysis of the fine specificity of this MAb showed that it recognized a synthetic peptide contained within variable domain IV of the MOMP. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (aId) directed against this anti-MOMP MAb were produced in rabbits. These aId specifically bound to the relevant idiotype (DP10) and inhibited the binding of anti-MOMP MAb (DP10) to MOMP preparations in a dose-dependent fashion. The specificity of our aId for the binding site of anti-MOMP MAb is further suggested by the binding inhibition of affinity-purified aId to DP10 by the synthetic peptide defined by the idiotype. In addition, these aId also reacted with anti-MOMP antisera from rats and mice, suggesting an idiotypic cross-reactivity between these species. Finally, immunization of naive mice with aId induced an antibody response directed against the peptide defined by our anti-MOMP MAb and with neutralizing activity. Taken together, these data suggest that aId mimic a neutralization site on MOMP and could serve as a surrogate antigen to induce protective immunity against Chlamydia trachomatis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
