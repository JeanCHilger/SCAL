The enzyme was induced in the infected cells and could not be detected in the MHV-A59 virion. Two peaks of RNA polymerase activity, one early and the other late in infection, were detected. These polymerase activities were in temporal sequence with early and late virus-specific RNA synthesis. Both of them were found to be associated with membrane fractions. There were significant differences in the enzymatic properties of the two polymerases. The early polymerase, but not the late polymerase, could be activated by potassium ions in the absence of magnesium ions and also had a lower optimum pH than the late polymerase. It was therefore probable that the enzymes represent two different species of RNA polymerase and perform different roles in virus-specific RNA synthesis. The effects of cycloheximide on MHV-specific RNA synthesis were determined. Continuous protein synthesis was required for both early and late RNA synthesis and might also be required for shutoff of early RNA synthesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
