Different serotypes had distinct fingerprints, but so did varieties within a serotype, allowing a greater degree of strain differentiation than was previously possible. Some conclusions can be drawn from the fingerprints concerning theories of origin and spread of infectious bronchitis virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
