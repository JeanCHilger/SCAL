Dogs were randomized into 2 groups and blood, nasal swabs, and pharyngeal swabs were collected prior to the administration of single component Bb vaccines intranasally or parenterally. Ten to 14 days later all dogs were resampled to measure changes in systemic and local antibody to Bb. There were no differences in the changes in Bb-reactive serum IgG and nasal IgA between the groups, whereas intranasally vaccinated dogs had significantly higher Bb-reactive serum IgA. These data indicate that both of the current generation of intranasal (modified-live) and injectable (acellular) Bb vaccines can stimulate anamnestic local and systemic antibody responses in previously vaccinated, Bb-seropositive adult household dogs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
