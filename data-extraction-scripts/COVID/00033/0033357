Transient and stable expression of p33/NAGT I in HeLa cells caused relocation of endogenous Mann II to the ER and transient expression of p33/Mann II had a similar effect on endogenous NAGT I. Neither of these endogenous medial enzymes were affected by transient expression of p33/GalT. These data provide strong evidence for kin recognition between medial Golgi enzymes and suggest a role for them in the organization of the Golgi stack.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
