Pairs of BMV RNA3 variants carrying marker mutations at different locations were coinoculated on a local lesion host, and the progeny RNA3 in a large number of lesions was analyzed. The majority of doubly infected lesions accumulated the RNA3 recombinants. The distribution of the recombinant types was relatively even, indicating that both RNA3 counterparts could serve as donor or as acceptor molecules. The frequency of crossovers between one pair of RNA3 variants, which possessed closely located markers, was similar to that of another pair of RNA3 variants with more distant markers, suggesting the existence of an internal recombination hot spot. The majority of crossovers were precise, but some recombinants had minor sequence modifications, possibly marking the sites of imprecise homologous crossovers. Our results suggest discontinuous RNA replication, with the replicase changing among the homologous RNA templates and generating RNA diversity. This approach can be easily extended to other RNA viruses for identification of homologous recombination hot spots.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
