The quantitation was based on a standard curve obtained by using a reference serum, for which the specific IgG content was assayed by immunochemical purification. IgG was first purified and specific rubella antibodies were separated by an immunoadsorbent prepared by linking rubella virus antigens to Sepharose 4B. By using IgG-specific conjugate, the levels of specific rubella IgG antibodies could then be determined from clinical samples. Seronegative samples showed antibody levels less than 1 microgram/ml, whereas levels up to several hundred micrograms per milliliter were detected in some postinfection sera. The correlation between microgram antibody levels and hemagglutination inhibition titers was linear. The method offers a simple and sensitive antibody assay which could be used both for the laboratory diagnosis of acute rubella and for the evaluation of immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
