P1 expressed in transgenic plants (P1 plants) can be used in trans to support replication of A1MV RNAs 2 and 3, and P2 expressed in transgenic plants (P2 plants) can be used in trans to support replication of A1MV RNAs 1 and 3. Wild-type RNA 1 was able to coreplicate with RNAs 2 and 3 in P1 plants, but this ability was abolished by frameshifts or deletions in the P1 gene of RNA 1. Similarly, wild-type RNA 2 coreplicated with RNAs 1 and 3 in P2 plants, but frameshifts or deletions in the P2 gene of RNA 2 interfered with this replication. Apparently, the P1 and P2 genes are required in cis for the accumulation of RNAs 1 and 2, respectively. Point mutations in the GDD motif of the P2 gene in RNA 2 interfered with accumulation of RNA 2 in P2 plants, indicating that replication of RNA 2 is linked to its translation into a functional protein. Plants transformed with both the P1 and P2 genes (P12 plants) accumulate replicase activity that is able to replicate RNA 3 in trans. An analysis of the time course of the accumulation of RNAs 1, 2, and 3 in protoplasts of P12 plants supported the conclusion that translation and replication are tightly coupled for A1MV RNAs 1 and 2 but not for RNA 3.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
