To determine if complementarity between these sequences is important for PVX RNA accumulation, we analyzed the effects of mutations within these elements and compensatory mutations in a tobacco protoplast system and in plants. Mutations in the 5' nontranslated region (NTR mutants) that reduced complementarity resulted in lower genomic RNA (gRNA) and sgRNA levels, whereas mutations to the octanucleotide elements affected only the corresponding sgRNA levels. However, for both the NTR and octanucleotide mutants, the extent of reductions in RNA levels did not directly correlate with the degree of complementarity, suggesting that the sequences of these elements are also important. Mutants containing changes in the NTR and compensatory changes in one of the octanucleotide elements restored levels of gRNA and the other sgRNA species with an unaltered octanucleotide element to those of wild-type. Although compensatory changes significantly increased levels of the sgRNA species with the modified octanucleotide element, levels were not restored to those of wild-type. Our data indicate that long distance RNA-RNA interactions and the sequences of the interacting elements are required for PVX plus-strand RNA accumulation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
