The cats were part of a study of 61 cats admitted to two university clinics over an eight-year period because of signs of CNS disease. The most frequent diseases were feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (12/27) and suspected viral disease other than FIP (10/27). Typical CSF findings in cats with FIP were a protein concentration of greater than 2 g/L (200 mg/dL) and a white cell count of over 100 cells/microL, which consisted predominantly of neutrophils. In contrast, the CSF of cats with suspected viral disease had a protein concentration of less than 1 g/L (100 mg/dL) and a total white cell count of less than 50 cells/microL. In general, cats with FIP or suspected viral disease were less than four years of age. Neurological signs were usually multifocal in cats with FIP, but focal in cats with suspected viral disease. The CSF findings were variable in five other inflammatory diseases represented. Two cats with protozoan infection had normal CSF total cell counts but abnormal differential counts. The CSF findings were invaluable in differentiating FIP from other causes of inflammatory CNS disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
