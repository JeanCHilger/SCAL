The effect of N glycosylation of the V domain of hPVR on binding and entry of poliovirus was studied. Stable mouse L-cell lines were generated that express PVR-specific cDNA. One of the cell lines expressed a mutant of hPVR, in which both asparagine residues of the two N-glycosylation sites of the V domain were changed to aspartate (N105D) and serine (N120S), respectively. In the second mutant cell line, the portion of the cDNA encoding the V domain of hPVR was substituted by the homologous sequence of the recently isolated PVR cDNA from monkey cells. This V domain naturally lacks both N glycosylation sites and encodes D105 and S120 at the respective positions of the open reading frame. Absence of N glycosylation at these sites was demonstrated by in vitro translation of the two mutant coding sequences in the presence of microsomal membranes. Both PVR mutant cell lines were capable of poliovirus binding and replication. However, binding of anti-PVR monoclonal antibody D171 and protection from viral replication by this antibody were observed only with the glycosylation mutant carrying the human V domain. In contrast, infection of the cell line expressing the monkey-human hybrid receptor was not blocked even though monkey cells are fully protected by monoclonal antibody D171. The data suggest that N glycosylation of the V domain of hPVR is not essential for viral replication in human tissues and that differential glycosylation of hPVR at these sites is likely not a determinant of viral tissue tropism. Furthermore, the virus binding site and the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody D171 do not appear to overlap.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
