Blood mononuclear cells and plasma were collected weekly for lymphocyte assays and serology. At week 14, spleen and lymph node cells were used for lymphocyte assays; brains and mesenteric lymph nodes were used for isolation of T. gondii. More T. gondii organisms were present in tissues of the dually infected cats than in tissues of cats with toxoplasmosis alone. Two dually infected cats and one cat infected with T. gondii developed chorioretinitis. Spleen, lymph node, and blood mononuclear cells from dually infected cats had the greatest reduction in mitogenic responses. By week 3, cats infected with FIV underwent a decrease in the number of CD4 cells that was not changed by concurrent T. gondii infection; the number of CD8 cells increased only in cats infected with T. gondii alone. For cats infected with T. gondii, the responses of lymphocytes to T. gondii antigen were not affected by FIV infection; the responses to FIV antigen were negligible in all groups. Overall, this study indicates that FIV infection favors T. gondii proliferation. Also, the establishment of toxoplasmosis may enhance FIV-induced immunodeficiency and is likely to cause a more rapid disease progression than that from infection with FIV alone.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
