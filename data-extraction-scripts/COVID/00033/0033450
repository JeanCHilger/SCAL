<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1994</DATELINE><TITLE>Crystallographic and cryo EM analysis of virion-receptor interactions</TITLE><BODY>Cryoelectron microscopy has been used to determine the first structure of a virus when complexed with its glycoprotein cellular receptor. Human rhinovirus 16 (HRV16) complexed with the two amino-terminal, immunoglobulin-like domains of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) shows that ICAM-1 binds into the 12Å deep “canyon” on the surface of the virus. This is consistent with the prediction that the viral receptor attachment site lies in a cavity inaccessible to the host's antibodies. The atomic structures of HRV14 and CD4, homologous to HRV16 and ICAM-1, showed excellent correspondence with observed density, thus establishing the virus-receptor interactions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
