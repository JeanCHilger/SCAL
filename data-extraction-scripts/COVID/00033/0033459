After an appropriate incubation period, the cells were fixed, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed directly in the microtiter plates for detection of virus. Results could be read and recorded automatically, which is especially helpful when running large numbers of tests.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
