In this study we have employed immunocytochemical techniques to analyze in detail the budding compartment(s) of the virus. Electron microscopy of infected BHK-21 cells showed that virus particles are found in the cisternae throughout the Golgi stack. Within the cisternae, the virus particles were located preferentially in the dilated rims. This would suggest that virus budding may begin at or before the cis Golgi membranes. The virus budding compartment was studied further by immunoelectron microscopy with a pre-Golgi intermediate compartment marker, p58, and a Golgi stack marker protein, mannosidase II (ManII). Virus particles and budding virus were detected in ManII-positive Golgi stack membranes and, interestingly, in both juxtanuclear and peripheral p58-positive elements of the intermediate compartment. In cells incubated at 15 degrees C the nucleocapsid and virus envelope proteins were seen to accumulate in the intermediate compartment. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that at 15 degrees C the nucleocapsid is associated with membranes that show a characteristic distribution and tubulo-vesicular morphology of the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment. These membranes contained virus particles in the lumen. The results indicate that the first site of formation of Uukuniemi virus particles is the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment and that virus budding continues in the Golgi stack. The results raise questions about the intracellular transport pathway of the virus particles, which are 100 to 120 nm in diameter and are therefore too large to be transported in the 60-nm-diameter vesicles postulated to function in the intra-Golgi transport. The distribution of the virus in the Golgi stack may imply that the cisternae themselves have a role in the vectorial transport of virus particles.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
