After contact of infectious virus with the cell plasma membrane, discernible changes of the envelope and tegument could be seen by electron microscopy. Noninfectious virions were arrested at distinct steps in interactions with cells. Viruses inactivated by anti-gD neutralizing antibodies attached to cells but were arrested prior to initiation of a visible fusion bridge between the virus and cell. As judged from its increased sensitivity to elution, virus lacking gD was less stably bound to cells than was virus containing gD. Moreover, soluble gD could substantially reduce virus attachment when added to cells prior to or with the addition of virus. Virus inactivated by anti-gH neutralizing antibodies attached and could form a fusion bridge but did not show expansion of the fusion bridge or extensive rearrangement of the envelope and tegument. We propose a model for infectious entry of HSV-1 by a series of interactions between the virion envelope and the cell plasma membrane that trigger virion disassembly, membrane fusion, and capsid penetration. In this entry process, gD mediates a stable attachment that is likely required for penetration, and gH seems to participate in fusion initiation or expansion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
