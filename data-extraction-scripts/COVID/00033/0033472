Families of deleted RNA molecules were derived from both segments of the bipartite viral genome and found to contain single, double, or triple deletions. These deletions were attributed to template switching by the flock house virus RNA replicase, resulting in recombination between distant sequences and excision of the intervening nucleotides. From sequence analysis of the recombination junctions, we concluded that the process of template switching was influenced by both the primary sequence and the secondary structure of the RNA and that it occurred predominantly during synthesis of RNA negative strands.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
