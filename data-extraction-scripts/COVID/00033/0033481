This occurred through the interaction of tax protein with the gene encoding class I MHC antigens but not through any soluble factors, such as interferons, or factors from glial cells. Since neural cells do not usually express MHC antigens, this novel mechanism may be an intermediate event between viral infection and subsequent immune-mediated pathology in the central nervous system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
