Sequences including the overlapping region, placed in novel contexts, can direct ribosomes to make a -1 frameshift in wheat germ extract, Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae. This sequence includes a consensus slippery sequence, GGGUUUA, and has the potential to form a pseudoknot 3' to the putative frameshift site. Based on deletion analysis, a region of 71 nucleotides including the potential pseudoknot and the putative slippery sequence is sufficient for frameshifting. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that the pseudoknot is essential for frameshifting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
