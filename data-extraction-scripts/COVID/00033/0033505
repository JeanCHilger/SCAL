Transfection of this cloned gG-2 construct into NIH 3T3 cells resulted in the stable expression of gG-2 upon induction with dexamethasone. In addition, the 104,000-molecular-weight (104K) and 72K gG-2 precursors as well as the 34K secreted component were generated in the transformed cells. The synthesis of gG-2 in these transformed cells appeared to follow the same cleavage-processing pathway as gG-2 synthesis during an HSV-2 infection. These results indicate that the processing of gG-2 can occur in the absence of an HSV-2 infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
