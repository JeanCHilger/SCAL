The cotton rat is classified in the family Cricetidae (with hamsters and gerbils) and is a distant cousin of the common laboratory rat (Rattus) classified in the family Muridae (with the common laboratory mouse, Mus). Antibody reagents that are specific for cotton rat immunoglobulins have not been described. To enhance the usefulness of this model, four immunoglobulins in Sigmodon serum were characterized (IgG1, IgG2, IgA, IgM) and antisera specific for each immunoglobulin were made. Sera from three different species of Sigmodon were examined, S. hispidus (SH), S. arizoni (SA) and S. fulviventer (SF). Although IgA and IgM appeared similar in all three species, the IgG were expressed differently because normal serum levels of IgG2 were deficient in SH when compared with SA and SF and to other rodents. Similarly, IgG2 antibody response to purified protein antigen was deficient in SH although the IgG1 antibody response was superior to that in SF and SA. The three cotton rat species were infected with respiratory syncytial virus, and the kinetics of the antibody response was measured. Neutralizing antibody developed faster and to a higher titre in SH than in SA and SF. The enhanced immunoresponsiveness in SH may compensate for the IgG2 deficiency in SH and these changes appear to be relatively recent events in the evolution of this most populous species of Sigmodon.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
