Spleen, mediastinal, and cervical lymph node cells from infected mice produced high levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and lower levels of IL-2 and IL-10 following in vitro restimulation. Little or no IL-4 or IL-5 was detected. Cytokine production was generally maximal at 10 days after infection, correlating with viral clearance from the lung, although significant levels were seen as early as 3 days after administration of the virus. In vitro infection of naive splenocytes induced B-cell- dependent secretion of IL-6 and IL-10, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-2 were produced only by cells that had been primed in vivo. Depletion of B lymphocytes from primed splenocyte populations did not, however, abrogate IL-6 and IL-10 production. Highly purified immune T cells made IL-6, IL-10. and IFN-gamma following in vitro restimulation with MHV-68. Thus, IL-6 and IL-10 are components of both the acquired and the innate host response. These cytokines have potential roles in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
