<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1980-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>The Prevention and Control of Epidemics of Acute Undifferentiated Diarrhea of Beef Calves in Western Canada</TITLE><BODY>It is frequently evident that outbreaks of diarrhea occur in spite of apparent “good management” and “good calving conditions”. This observation underlies the fact that we still do not understand many of the epidemiological factors which contribute to calf diarrhea outbreaks. For example, we still lack biological criteria by which to judge the degree of crowding and the degree of stress. Nevertheless, application of the principles described above will prevent or decrease the severity of many annual epidemics. To be successful, a program of prevention and control should be discussed with producers long before the calving season, preferably during the preceding summer or fall. Implementation of a complete program may take several calving seasons and producers should be made aware that prevention by improved management is an on-going, evolutionary process. More and improved vaccines are becoming available; however, as is the case with most biologicals, their impact cannot be determined until after they have been used for several years. They should be recognized as only one of several managent tools at the disposal of the veterinarian and livestock producer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
