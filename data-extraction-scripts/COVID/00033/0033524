The glycan moieties of the nonimmunoglobulin fraction of plasma mimicked the oligosaccharide moiety of intestinal receptors recognized by K99 pili. These glycoprotein glycans inhibited adhesion of E. coli K99+ ST+ to erythrocyte glycoconjugates in vitro, and they protected colostrum-deprived newborn calves against lethal doses of enterotoxigenic E. coli (10(10) bacteria). Adhesion of bacteria to the intestines (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) was significantly reduced (by 2 orders of magnitude) in treated calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
