<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-04-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Natural Pathogens of Laboratory Mice, Rats, and Rabbits and Their Effects on Research</TITLE><BODY>Laboratory mice, rats, and rabbits may harbor a variety of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal agents. Frequently, these organisms cause no overt signs of disease. However, many of the natural pathogens of these laboratory animals may alter host physiology, rendering the host unsuitable for many experimental uses. While the number and prevalence of these pathogens have declined considerably, many still turn up in laboratory animals and represent unwanted variables in research. Investigators using mice, rats, and rabbits in biomedical experimentation should be aware of the profound effects that many of these agents can have on research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
