Two weeks after a single intradermal injection of 150 microliters of pristane, the rats developed severe and chronic arthritis. The inflammation was restricted to the joints and involved pannus formation, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, and T lymphocyte infiltration. The initial development as well as the chronic stage of pristane-induced arthritis was ameliorated by treatment with antibodies to the alpha beta-T-cell receptor showing that the disease is T cell dependent. Increased levels of interleukin in serum was seen after pristane injection but not during the chronic stage of arthritis. Joint erosions were accompanied by elevated serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. Comparison of MHC congenic LEW strains showed that the severity and chronicity of arthritis varied among the different MHC haplotypes. Rats with RT1f haplotype showed a significantly higher susceptibility to pristane-induced arthritis. A strong influence of non-MHC genes was also suggested by the variability of arthritis susceptibility among different strains with the same MHC haplotype; the most susceptible background was the DA and the least susceptible was the E3. Arthritis induced with a well defined nonimmunogenic adjuvant, with a disease course that closely resembles that of rheumatoid arthritis, makes a suitable animal model for future studies of the pathology and genetics of rheumatoid arthritis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
