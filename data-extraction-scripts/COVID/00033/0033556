These cells remained highly differentiated, with subpopulations of cells which retained active ciliary motility and others which demonstrated specialized secretory functions. The epithelial cells were permissive for growth of influenza A virus. Primary respiratory epithelial cells provide a model system for examining virulence, cell tropism, and receptors which replicate in the nasopharynx.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
