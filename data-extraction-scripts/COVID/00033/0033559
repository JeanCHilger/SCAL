The peplomer glycoprotein was purified by affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1D.G3. A collection of 48 MAbs against TGE virus was developed from which 26, 10, and 3 were specific for proteins E2, N, and E1, respectively. A total of 14 neutralizing MAbs of known reactivity were E2 protein specific. In addition, MAb 1B.C11, of unknown specificity, was also neutralizing. These MAbs reduced the virus titer 10(2)- to 10(9)-fold. Six different epitopes critical in TGE virus neutralization were found, all of which were conformational based on their immunogenicity and antigenicity. Only the epitope defined by MAb 1G.A7 was resistant to sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment, although it was destroyed by incubation in the presence of both the detergent and beta-mercaptoethanol. The frequency of MAb-resistant (mar) mutants selected with four MAbs (1G.A7, 1B.C11, 1G.A6, and 1E.F9) ranged from 10(-6) to 10(-7), whereas the frequency of the putative mar mutant defined by MAb 1B.B11 was lower than 10(-9). Furthermore, the epitopes defined by these MAbs and by MAbs 1H.C2 and 1A.F10, were present in 11 viral isolated with different geographical locations, years of isolation, and passage numbers (with the exception of two epitopes absent or modified in the TOY 56 viral isolate), suggesting that the critical epitopes in TGE virus neutralization were highly conserved.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
