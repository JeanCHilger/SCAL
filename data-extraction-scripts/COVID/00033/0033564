A number of different electropherotypes were present during each of the epidemics, although a single type was predominant in each one. The predominant electropherotype of the first epidemic persisted in the area for approximately 2 years afterwards. Apart from this electropherotype, only three others were recognized in the 3 years between the two epidemics. One of these, first seen 1 year before the second epidemic, bore a very close similarity to the predominant type of the second epidemic. Altogether, 12 different electropherotypes were recognized during the period of the survey. No type common to both areas was found when rotavirus electropherotypes recognized in Central Australia were compared with those detected in a 1973-to-1979 survey in Melbourne, Australia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
