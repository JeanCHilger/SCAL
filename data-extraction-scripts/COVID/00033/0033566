The pigs were allocated to 5 treatment groups: 4 groups received a single intramuscular injection of RespiSure-ONE (a commercial Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccine; n = 197), Emulsigen (an oil-based adjuvant; n = 172), Alhydrogel (an aluminum-hydroxide-based adjuvant; n = 172), or physiologic saline (n = 218); 1 group received no treatment (n = 171). Pigs affected by PMWS were found in all the groups. Antigen to Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) was detected by immunohistochemical testing within lesions of mesenteric lymph node, spleen, Peyerâ€™s patch, and lung of affected pigs. There was no significant difference in the incidence of PMWS among the groups. The findings indicate that immunostimulation did not influence the expression of PMWS in this study. Thus, routine vaccination against swine diseases may not significantly contribute to the occurrence of PMWS under field conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
