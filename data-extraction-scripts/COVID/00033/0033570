Two strategies were followed: (i) screening of two series of overlapping peptides (12- and 25-residue peptides) covering the entire S4 sequence by a panel of murine monoclonal anti-PT antibodies and various polyclonal anti-PT antisera in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and (ii) analysis of the S4 amino acid sequence by a predictive algorithm followed by synthesis and immunization of mice with the predicted peptides coupled to diphtheria toxoid. The anti-peptide conjugate antisera were tested in an ELISA for cross-reactivity with native PT, B oligomer, and S4. Screening of the free peptides in an ELISA by the PT antisera indicated the presence of six B-cell epitope-containing domains covered by residues 18 to 32, 33 to 46, 39 to 52, 51 to 65, 71 to 84, and 91 to 106. None of the peptides, however, were recognized by the monoclonal anti-PT antibodies in an ELISA. Immunization with six computer-predicted peptides (B1 to B6) and three potential T-cell epitopes (T1 to T3) gave rise to very high antibody responses towards the homologous conjugates. With the exception of the anti-T1/diphtheria toxoid antisera, all anti-peptide conjugate antisera cross-reacted with PT in an ELISA at different levels. None of these anti-peptide conjugate antisera, however, showed any PT-neutralizing effect as measured by the Chinese hamster ovary cell assay and the leukocytosis-promoting activity test. The results of the present study suggest that discontinuous epitopes are predominant in the S4 subunit of native PT.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
