<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1981-05-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Alleged Mycotoxicosis in Swine: Review of a Court Case</TITLE><BODY>Vomition and diarrhea in feeder pigs, and signs of hyperestrogenism in sows and pregnant gilts in a large swine operation were thought to be caused by mycotoxins. Various toxicoanalytical tests performed were negative and the cause of the disease was never clearly established. On the basis of the Sale of Goods legislation, a court ruled that the company supplying the feed was responsible for the losses that occurred. The veterinary and legal aspects of the case are reviewed, and it is concluded that there is a need for reliable and readily available laboratory diagnosis of toxins in feedstuff. The importance of gathering whatever evidence is available and of conducting whatever tests are capable of being conducted, is stressed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
