Among transmissible gastroenteritis virus isolates, plaque size varied considerably and mixed size ranges sometimes occurred. The most recently isolated viruses produced smaller plaques than the laboratory viruses or hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. All transmissible gastroenteritis virus isolates reacted in the plaque neutralization test with a transmissible gastroenteritis virus antiserum which showed no activity against hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Plaque neutralization results both from experimentally infected pigs and following a field outbreak demonstrated the reliability of this test and its greater sensitivity than the conventional tube test.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
