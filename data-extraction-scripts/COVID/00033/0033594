To determine whether increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha gene expression is an important regulatory event in virus-induced bronchiolar fibrosis, pulmonary TNF-alpha mRNA and protein expression was assessed in rat strains that are susceptible (Brown Norway; BN) and resistant (Fischer 344; F344) to virus-induced bronchiolar fibrosis. Virus-inoculated BN rats had increased TNF-alpha pulmonary mRNA levels (P < 0.05) and increased numbers of bronchiolar macrophages and fibroblasts expressing TNF-alpha protein compared with virus-inoculated F344 rats (P < 0.05). Virus inoculation also induced elevated TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels (P < 0.05) in cultured rat alveolar macrophages (NR8383 cells). A 55-kd soluble TNF receptor-immunoglobulin G fusion protein (sTNFR-IgG) was used to inhibit TNF-alpha bioactivity in virus-inoculated BN rats. Treated rats had fewer proliferating bronchiolar fibroblasts, as detected by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, compared with virus-inoculated control rats (P < 0.05). There was also increased mortality in p55sTNFR-IgG-treated virus-inoculated rats associated with increased viral replication and decreased numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P < 0.05). The results of this study indicate that 1) Sendai virus can directly up-regulate TNF-alpha mRNA and protein expression in macrophages, 2) TNF-alpha is an important mediator of virus-induced bronchiolar fibrosis, and 3) TNF-alpha has a critical role in the termination of Sendai viral replication in the lung.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
