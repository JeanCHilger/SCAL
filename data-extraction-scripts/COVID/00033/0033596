We assisted a researcher in performing serial liver biopsies in rats (Rattus norvegicus) to assess the transport of iron on a cellular level. We developed a novel collection approach that used laparotomy through a midline abdominal incision and disposable biopsy punches to obtain liver samples at 3 different times at various intervals. We hypothesized the survival of the subjects undergoing the multiple survival procedures would be independent of the weight loss or gain sustained throughout the study. Although 2 rats died during the study, the results were statistically significant with regard to survival when comparing the Belgrade rats to the Sprague Dawley rats and Swiss Webster mice and were independent of the weight loss or gain incurred during the study. We also performed a pilot study in mice (Mus musculus), using the same method as in the rats, with equivalent results. Our study showed the survival of rodents that underwent multiple laparotomies and liver biopsies was independent of the weight gain or loss throughout the study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
