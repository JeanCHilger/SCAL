We reviewed 2,911 children with LCPD from 10 different centers around the world. They were divided into two groups: those from India (505 children, mean age 8.1 ± 2.3 years) and those from other than India (2,406 children, mean age 5.8 ± 2.2 years). A simple distribution with an excellent fit to the data was ln(y) = a + bx + cxln(x), where y is the proportion of children with LCPD at age of diagnosis x (r(2) = 0.994 for non-Indian and 0.959 for Indian children). The age of the triggering event was 1.32 years for non-Indian and 2.77 years for Indian children; the median incubation period was 4.30 years non-Indian and 5.33 years for Indian patients. Knowing the incubation period and age of triggering event narrows the number of potential etiologies in LCPD. this study does not support a prenatal triggering event as postulated in the past. similar incubation periods with different ages at diagnosis supports a common insult which occurs at different ages in different populations dependent upon local factors such as geographic location and ethnicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
