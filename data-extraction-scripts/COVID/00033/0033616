Out of 181 children 29 were found with viruses of whom 18 had nonspecific abdominal pain. Eight others were found to have virus-like particles on electron microscopical examination of their faeces. Virus infections contribute to a small extent to nonspecific abdominal pain in childhood, but in many cases the cause remains unknown.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
