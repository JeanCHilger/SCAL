G residues are inserted into a short G run contained within a larger purine run (A(n)G(n)) in this process, by a mechanism whereby the transcribing polymerase stutters (i.e., reads the same template cytosine more than once). Although Sendai virus (SeV) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (bPIV3) are closely related, the G insertions in their P mRNAs are distributed differently. SeV predominantly inserts a single G residue within the G run of the sequence 5′ AACAAAAAAGGG, whereas bPIV3 inserts one to six G’s at roughly equal frequency within the sequence 5′ AUUAAAAAAGGGG (differences are underlined). We have examined how the cis-acting editing sequence determines the number of G’s inserted, both in a transfected cell system using minigenome analogues and by generating recombinant viruses. We found that the presence of four rather than three G’s in the purine run did not affect the distribution of G insertions. However, when the underlined AC of the SeV sequence was replaced by the UU found in bPIV3, the editing phenotype from both the minigenome and the recombinant virus resembled that found in natural bPIV3 infections (i.e., a significant fraction of the mRNAs contained two to six G insertions). The two nucleotides located just upstream of the polypurine tract are thus key determinants of the editing phenotype of these viruses. Moreover, the minimum number of A residues that will promote SeV editing phenotype is six but can be reduced to five when the upstream AC is replaced by UU. A model for how the upstream dinucleotide controls the insertion phenotype is presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
