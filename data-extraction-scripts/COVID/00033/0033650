Rigorous study of the specific mechanisms by which HRSV predisposes to otitis media has been hindered by lack of a relevant animal model. We recently reported that the chinchilla, the preferred rodent host for studying otitis media, is semipermissive for upper-airway HRSV infection. In the current study, we defined the anatomy and kinetics of HRSV infection and spread in the upper airway of chinchilla hosts. Chinchillas were challenged intranasally with a fluorescent-proteinâ€“expressing HRSV. Upper-airway tissues were recovered at multiple time points after viral challenge and examined by confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. HRSV replication was observed from the rostral- to caudalmost regions of the nasal cavity as well as throughout the Eustachian tube in a time-dependent manner. Although fluorescence was not observed and virus was not detected in nasopharyngeal lavage fluids 14 d after infection, the latest time point examined in this study, occasional clusters of immunopositive cells were present, suggesting that the nasal cavity may serve as a reservoir for HRSV. These data provide important new information concerning the time course of HRSV infection of the uppermost airway and suggest that chinchillas may be useful for modeling the HRSV-induced changes that predispose to secondary bacterial infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
