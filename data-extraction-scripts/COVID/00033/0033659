Using stepwise logistic regression it was found that an increased percentage of heifers calving in the herd, poor drainage in the nursing area, providing limited shelter in the nursing area, a large calving area, and wintering cows and heifers on the same ground were conditionally associated with an increase in the odds of high mortality from neonatal diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
