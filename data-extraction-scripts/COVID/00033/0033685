To study the mechanisms responsible for the targeting of P-selectin to storage granules, we transfected its cDNA into COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells, which lack a regulated exocytic pathway, or into AtT20 cells, which are capable of regulated secretion. P-selectin was expressed on the plasma membrane of COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells but was concentrated in storage granules of AtT20 cells. Immunogold electron microscopy indicated that the electron-dense granules containing P-selectin in AtT20 cells also stored the endogenous soluble hormone ACTH. Activation of AtT20 cells with 8-Br-cAMP increased the surface expression of P-selectin, consistent with agonist-induced fusion of granule membranes with the plasma membrane. Deletion of the last 23 amino acids of the 35-residue cytoplasmic domain resulted in delivery of P-selectin to the plasma membrane of AtT20 cells. Replacement of the cytoplasmic tail of tissue factor, a plasma membrane protein, with the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin redirected the chimeric molecule to granules. We conclude that the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin is both necessary and sufficient for sorting of membrane proteins into the regulated pathway of secretion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
