<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1984-05-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Astrovirus and Breda virus infections of dome cell epithelium of bovine ileum.</TITLE><BODY>A bovine enteric virus antigenically related to the United Kingdom isolate of bovine astrovirus was isolated from diarrheic feces, also containing rotavirus, of a calf in Florida. The astrovirus infected cell cultures and the epithelial cells of domes in the ileum, and there was cross-immunofluorescence with antiserum to the United Kingdom astrovirus. Calves infected with astrovirus alone did not develop clinical disease, but when astrovirus was mixed with rotavirus or Breda virus 2, the calves developed severe diarrhea and more extensive astrovirus infection of the dome epithelium. The dome epithelial cells showed degeneration associated with astrovirus infection, and a few cells showed degeneration with Breda virus 2 infection. Virions with a 30-nm diameter were seen in astrovirus-infected dome cells, and Breda virus 2 virions were also observed either in separate cells or, on occasion, with both viruses in one cell.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
