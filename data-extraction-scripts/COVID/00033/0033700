To localize the homologous region between the RNAs, we compared fingerprints of the 3′ terminus of the genome with those of RNA 7. The genome was partially degraded with alkali, and polyadenylate-containing fragments were purified by oligodeoxythymidylate-cellulose chromatography. The fragments were size fractionated by agarose-urea gel electrophoresis, and two pools, x and z, containing 3′-derived fragments of the genome with apparent molecular weights of 0.1 × 10(6) to 0.14 × 10(6) and 0.6 × 10(6) to 0.8 × 10(6), respectively, were further analyzed by RNase T(1) oligonucleotide fingerprinting. Comparison of the fingerprints of RNAs 6 and 7 with those of pools x and z showed that these subgenomic RNAs extend inwards from the 3′ terminus of the genome. The RNA fragments present in pool z were on average slightly larger than RNA 7 as confirmed by the presence in pool z of T(1) oligonucleotide spots specific for RNA 6 but not present in RNA 7. However, two large oligonucleotide spots derived from RNA 7, which were also present in RNAs 1, 3, and 6 and in the virion RNA, were not found in the T(1) oligonucleotide map of pool z. A possible explanation is that the two spots were derived from a leader sequence. The results of UV transcription mapping experiments (L. Jacobs, W. J. M. Spaan, M. C. Horzinek, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, J. Virol. 39:401-406, 1981) excluded the possibility that such a leader sequence arises by splicing from a larger precursor molecule, but either a virus-specific RNA primer molecule for the synthesis of mRNAs or an RNA polymerase jumping mechanism could explain the presence of a leader sequence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
