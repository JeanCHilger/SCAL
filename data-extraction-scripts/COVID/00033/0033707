The G6 serotype was the most prevalent, accounting for viruses in 55.7% of the samples; viruses of the G10 and G8 serotypes were found in 34.9 and 4.7% of the samples, respectively. The virus in one sample (0.7%) was not classified due to concomitant infection with G6 and G8 strains, whereas viruses in six samples (4.0%) could not be characterized with any of the three G serotype-specific primers selected for the present study. When examined for their P-serotype specificities, viruses in 55 and 42.3% of the samples were characterized as P[11] and P[5], respectively, no P[1] serotype was identified, and viruses in 2.7% of the samples could not be classified due to multiple reactivity with both P[5]- and P[11]-specific primers. Various combinations of G and P serotypes were observed, the most frequent being G6,P[5] (38.3%), G10,P[11] (31.5%), and G6,P[11] (15.4%). The results of the present study, while contributing to a better understanding of the epidemiology of bovine rotaviruses in Italy, address the relevance of serotype specificity with regard to the constancy of the quality of bovine rotavirus vaccines under different field conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
