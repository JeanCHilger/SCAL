CCR2-deficient mice infected with C. neoformans develop a non-protective T2 immune response and persistent infection. The mechanisms responsible for this aberrant response are unknown. The objective of this study was to define the number, phenotype, and micro-anatomic location of dendritic cells (DC) residing within the lung of CCR2(+/+) or CCR2(−/−) mice throughout a time course following infection with C. neoformans. Results demonstrate the CCR2-mediated recruitment of conventional DC expressing modest amounts of co-stimulatory molecules. DC recruitment was preceded by the up-regulation in the lung of the CCR2 ligands CCL2 and CCL7. Co-localization of numerous DC and CD4(+) T cells within bronchovascular infiltrates coincided with increased expression of IL-12 and IFN-γ. By contrast, in the absence of CCR2, DC recruitment was markedly impaired, bronchovascular infiltrates were diminished, and mice developed features of T2 responses, including bronchovascular collagen deposition and IL-4 production. Our results demonstrate that CCR2 is required for the recruitment of large numbers of conventional DC to bronchovascular infiltrates in mice mounting a T1 immune response against a fungal pathogen. These findings shed new insight into the mechanism(s) by which DC recruitment alters T cell polarization in response to an infectious challenge within the lung.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
