<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1975-10-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral susceptibility of a cell line derived from the pig oviduct.</TITLE><BODY>Seventeen of 24 RNA viruses and eight of nine DNA viruses replicated in a cell line derived from a pig fallopian tube. The following RNA viruses grew poorly in it: the virus of transmissible gastroenteritis of pig and the swine-influenza, Sendai and bovine para-influenza type 3 viruses. Among other RNA viruses an untyped swine para-myxovirus and some picornaviruses, rhabdoviruses and togaviruses attained high titers and produced an extensive cytopathic effect. Among the DNA viruses a porcine adeno, equine rhinopneumonitis, infectious bovine rhinotraceheitis, pseudorabies and porcine cytomegalo viruses replicated in pig fallopian tube cells as well as in other cells generally used to grow them.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
