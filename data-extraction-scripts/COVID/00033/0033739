In BALB/c (H-2d) mice, the dominant response is directed against an Ld-restricted peptide in the nucleocapsid protein (APTAGAFFF). Characterization of the fine specificity of this response revealed that the predicted anchor residues at positions 2 and 9 were the most critical for class I binding. Amino acids at positions 7 and 8 were identified as T-cell receptor contact residues. Virus-induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes to other Ld motif-containing nucleocapsid peptides were not detected, despite the identification of two epitopes with reduced Ld affinity. These data suggest that mutations within four residues of the dominant epitope could contribute to the persistence of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
