The method is based on the well-characterized hemolysin transport system (Hly) of E. coli that specifically secretes the target protein from the bacterial cytoplasm into the extracellular medium without a periplasmic intermediate. The culture media that accumulate these Hly-secreted scFv's can be used in a variety of immunoassays without purification. In addition, these culture supernatants are stable over long periods of time and can be handled basically as immune sera.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
