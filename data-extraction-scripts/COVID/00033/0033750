Competition analyses indicated that all five neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognize contiguous, if not identical, epitopes on the envelope glycoprotein of LDV (VP-3) which are not recognized by nonneutralizing VP-3-specific monoclonal antibodies isolated from the same fusion. Despite the presence of neutralizing activity, polyclonal anti-LDV antibodies obtained from persistently infected mice did not compete for binding to LDV with four of the five neutralizing monoclonal antibodies tested. The results indicate that the envelope glycoprotein of LDV possesses a major neutralizing epitope which is poorly recognized, if at all, by mice during a natural infection but is rendered immunogenic by Formalin inactivation of the virus. The epitope was also not immunogenic in a rabbit, since its polyclonal LDV-neutralizing antibodies did not inhibit binding of the mouse monoclonal antibodies to LDV. Passive immunization with the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies did not protect mice from LDV infection and did not alter the course of infection. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been used to select a neutralization escape variant by a novel combination of in vitro and in vivo isolation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
