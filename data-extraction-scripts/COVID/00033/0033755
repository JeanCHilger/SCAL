Disease risk is enhanced by intensive rearing practices and poor on-farm biosecurity. This investigation was undertaken in farmed meat rabbits during an Ontario-wide outbreak of enteritis with high mortality to determine the prevalence of causative agents. A survey evaluating on-farm biosecurity practices was also conducted to identify potential means of pathogen contamination and zoonotic risks. Gross and microscopic pathology evaluations combined with microbiologic testing were conducted on 95 rabbits over spring and winter months. Escherichia coli and Clostridium spiroforme were most commonly associated with enteritis in rabbits regardless of age or season and lesions were significantly more severe in mature does (P < 0.0001). The survey results demonstrated a lack of consistent on-farm biosecurity practices. The infectious nature of enteric disease of rabbits combined with poor biosecurity practices may contribute to disease transmission within and between farms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
