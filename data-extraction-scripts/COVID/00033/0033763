Polystyrene beads were used as the solid phase, guinea-pig and rabbit anti-NCDV immunoglobulin as the catching and secondary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin as the indicator antibody. A comparison of the developed NCDV-EIA with an identical EIA, using antisera against human rotavirus (HRV-EIA) instead of NCDV antisera, was made with 216 stool specimens positive or negative for rotavirus. A complete agreement was obtained between the two methods provided that appropriate confirmatory tests were included. The developed NCDV-EIA was as sensitive and specific for rotavirus as the HRV-EIA, and it allowed the detection of both established rotavirus types 1 and 2 from stools with equal sensitivity. The difficulties in cultivating human rotavirus in vitro for immunisation and the relative ease of growing NCDV in widely-used continuous cell lines make NCDV a good alternative in the preparation of the highly specific and sensitive rotavirus antisera required in immunoassays, and facilitate the setting-up methods for the routine diagnosis of rotavirus gastroenteritis by EIA or RIA in diagnostic virus laboratories.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
