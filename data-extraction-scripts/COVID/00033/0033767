The change in moisture content during the storage period was an additional parameter which may influence the infectivity titer. The results emphasized the difficulty of predetermining variations in infectivity titers from the initial residual moisture. The analysis of the variations in infectivity titers during the storage of two vaccines led to the formulation of a hypothesis of the presence of two components of different thermostability. Moreover, the temporary increase in the infectivity titer of infectious bronchitis vaccine stored progressively dissociating during storage concurrent with a progressive inactivation of infectious particles.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
