<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1983-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Isolation and characterization of an equine rotavirus.</TITLE><BODY>A rotavirus, designated as the H-1 strain, was isolated from a diarrheic foal in primary African green monkey kidney cells and MA104 cells. This cell culture-adapted strain hemagglutinated erythrocytes of human group O, rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, and sheep. It was found to be similar, if not identical, to porcine rotaviruses (strains OSU, EE, and A-580) by plaque reduction neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests, and, in addition, it was found to belong to subgroup 1. This equine rotavirus has an RNA electrophoretic migration pattern which was distinct from those of the three strains of porcine rotavirus. The serological relationship established by plaque reduction neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests between the equine (H-1) and porcine (OSU, EE, and A-580) rotaviruses is an example of a rotavirus of the same serotype being isolated from different species. The H-1 strain was distinct from four human rotavirus serotypes (Wa, DS-1, P, and St. Thomas 4) as well as from bovine rotavirus NCDV, simian rotavirus MMU18006, and canine rotavirus CU-1 by plaque reduction neutralization tests. This equine isolate (H-1) was found to be related antigenically to canine CU-1 and bovine NCDV rotaviruses in a one-way fashion by hemagglutination inhibition tests.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
