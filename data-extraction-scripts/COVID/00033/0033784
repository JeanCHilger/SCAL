<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1999-01-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Development and Applications of a Bovine Coronavirus Antigen Detection Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</TITLE><BODY>We developed a monoclonal antibody-based, antigen capture sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for bovine coronavirus. We compared the ELISA with electron microscopy and the hemagglutination test and found a close correlation between them. The sensitivity of the ELISA was 10(4) bovine coronavirus particles per ml of 10% fecal suspension. Compared with electron microscopy, bovine coronavirus ELISA had 96% specificity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
