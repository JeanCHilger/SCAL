Condensation and margination of chromatin, cellular shrinkage with severe vacuolar degeneration, and blebbing were observed. In addition, fragmentation of cellular DNA was observed, and a decrease in virus titer was accompanied by those changes. These findings show that the cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes induce in the target cell an internal degradation program termed apoptosis, which results in virus clearance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
