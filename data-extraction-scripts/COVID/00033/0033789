The HEPA-filtration system involved a pre-filter screen, a bag filter (EU8 rating), and a HEPA filter (EU13 rating). The low-cost-filtration system contained mosquito netting (pre-filter), a fiberglass furnace filter, and an electrostatic furnace filter. For UV irradiation, a lamp emitted UVC radiation at 253.7 nm. No form of intervention was used in the control group. The experimental facilities consisted of 2 chambers connected by a 1.3-m-long duct. Recipient pigs, housed in chamber 2, were exposed to artificial aerosols created by a mechanically operated mister containing modified live PRRSV vaccine located in chamber 1. Aerosol transmission of PRRSV occurred in 9 of the 10 control replicates, 8 of the 10 UVC-irradiation replicates, 4 of the 10 low-cost-filtration replicates, and 0 of the 10 HEPA-filtration replicates. When compared with no intervention, HEPA filtration and low-cost filtration significantly reduced PRRSV transmission (P < 0.0005 and = 0.0286, respectively), whereas UV irradiation had no effect (P = 0.5). However, low-cost filtration and UV irradiation were significantly less effective (P = 0.043 and P < 0.0005, respectively) than HEPA filtration. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, HEPA filtration was significantly more effective at reducing aerosol transmission of PRRSV than the other methods evaluated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
