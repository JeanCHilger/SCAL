<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1977-07-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Solid-Phase Radioimmunoassay for Detecting Bovine (Neonatal Calf Diarrhea) Rotavirus Antibody</TITLE><BODY>An indirect solid-phase microradioimmunoassay is described for detecting antibodies against rotaviruses. The test involved ethanol fixation of microcultures of bovine rotavirus-infected BSC-1 cells and reaction with bovine antirotavirus serum, followed by (125)I-labeled rabbit anti-bovine immunoglobulin G. The technique was shown to be virus specific and highly sensitive. The fixed microcultures could be stored at 4Â°C for at least 2 months without affecting the sensitivity of the test. The application of this system for the detection of rotavirus antibodies in humans is briefly discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
