All strains were identified as subgroup 2 rotaviruses by RNA gel electrophoresis, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The human rotavirus strains were propagated for 15 to 20 passages and then used for immunization of guinea pigs and rabbits. Animal antisera were also raised against a subgroup 1 human strain purified from stools and against the cell culture-adapted Wa strain, a reference subgroup 2 rotavirus of human origin. Cross-neutralization studies revealed the existence of two distinct serotypes within the cell culture-adapted subgroup 2 human rotaviruses: strains related and unrelated to strain Wa were classified as serotypes 1 and 3, respectively. Results with convalescent-phase sera from infants with primary rotavirus infections confirmed the existence of two serotypes within subgroup 2, and the serotypes responsible for primary subgroup 2 infections could be determined on the basis of the neutralizing reactivity of convalescent sera.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
