<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014</DATELINE><TITLE>Axonal Pathology and Demyelination in Viral Models of Multiple Sclerosis</TITLE><BODY>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Monozygotic twin studies suggest that while there is a genetic contribution, genetics alone cannot be the sole determining factor in the development of MS. As the rates of MS are increasing, particularly among women, environmental factors such as viral infections are coming to the foreground as potential agents in triggering disease in genetically susceptible individuals. This review highlights pathological aspects related to two pre-clinical viral models for MS; data are consistent between these two models as experimental infection of susceptible mice can induce axonal degeneration associated with demyelination. These data are consistent with observations in MS that axonal damage or Wallerian degeneration is occurring within the CNS contributing to the disability and disease severity. Such early damage, where axonal damage is primary to secondary demyelination, could set the stage for more extensive immune mediated demyelination arising later.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
