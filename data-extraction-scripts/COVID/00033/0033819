Expression of the HE protein in vitro in the presence of microsomes revealed N-terminal signal peptide cleavage and C-terminal anchorage but not disulfide-linked dimerization. Dimerization was observed only after expression in vivo, during which HE was also transported to the cell surface.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
