<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2000-07-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Growth, Adipose, Brain, and Skin Alterations Resulting from Targeted Disruption of the Mouse Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor β(δ)</TITLE><BODY>To determine the physiological roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β (PPARβ), null mice were constructed by targeted disruption of the ligand binding domain of the murine PPARβ gene. Homozygous PPARβ-null term fetuses were smaller than controls, and this phenotype persisted postnatally. Gonadal adipose stores were smaller, and constitutive mRNA levels of CD36 were higher, in PPARβ-null mice than in controls. In the brain, myelination of the corpus callosum was altered in PPARβ-null mice. PPARβ was not required for induction of mRNAs involved in epidermal differentiation induced by O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The hyperplastic response observed in the epidermis after TPA application was significantly greater in the PPARβ-null mice than in controls. Inflammation induced by TPA in the skin was lower in wild-type mice fed sulindac than in similarly treated PPARβ-null mice. These results are the first to provide in vivo evidence of significant roles for PPARβ in development, myelination of the corpus callosum, lipid metabolism, and epidermal cell proliferation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
