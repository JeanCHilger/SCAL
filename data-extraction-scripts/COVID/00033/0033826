It was found that the major effects of the disease were produced in localized areas where parenchyma, sinusoids and blood were obliterated. However, immediately peripheral to these lesions blood flow and vessels were unaffected other than by localized hypertrophy of KÃ¼pffer cells. While each lesion produced a sinusoidal block to blood flow, portal hypertension did not occur even in the presence of extensive focal and confluent necrosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
