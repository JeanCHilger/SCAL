A comparison was made between cattle that eliminated FMDV and those that developed and maintained a persistent infection. Serological and mucosal antibody responses were detected in all animals after challenge. IgA and IgM were detected before the development of IgG1 and IgG2 responses. IgM was not detected in vaccinated cattle. Challenge with FMDV elicited a prolonged biphasic secretory antibody response in FMDV "carrier' animals only. The response was detected as FMDV-specific IgA in both mucosal secretions and serum samples, which gained statistical significance (P < 0.05) by 5 weeks after challenge. This observation could represent the basis of a test to differentiate vaccinated and/or recovered convalescent cattle from FMDV "carriers'.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
