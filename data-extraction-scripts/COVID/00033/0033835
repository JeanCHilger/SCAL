We have examined PTV glycoprotein transport, assembly, and release and the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on these processes. Both the G1 and G2 proteins were transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and retained in the Golgi complex in a stable structure, either during PTV infection or when expressed from a vaccinia virus recombinant. BFA treatment causes a rapid and dramatic change in the distribution of the G1 and G2 proteins, from a Golgi pattern to an ER pattern. The G1 and G2 proteins were found to be modified by medial but not trans Golgi network enzymes, in the presence or absence of BFA. We found that BFA blocks PTV release from cells but does not interfere with the intracellular assembly of infectious virions. Further, the BFA block of virus release is fully reversible, with high levels of virus release occurring upon removal of the inhibitor. It was also found that the release of PTV virions is polarized, occurring exclusively from the basolateral surfaces of the polarized Vero C1008 epithelial cell line.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
