Methods: We gathered 113 ONFH patients and 116 controls in the study. The polymorphisms of ABCB1 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were adopted to analyze the correlation between ABCB1 polymorphisms and ONFH. Results: In the study, we found that the frequency of C3435T TT genotype was much lower in case group, compared with that of controls (17.7% vs. 23.3%). Moreover, OR and 95% CI values indicated that C3435T TT genotype served as a protective factor for ONFH (OR=0.34, 95% CI=0.15-0.75). Meanwhile, the risk for the T allele carriers was much lower than C allele (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.42-0.87). However, C1236T polymorphism showed no significant effects on the pathogenesis of ONFH. In the haplotype analysis, T-T haplotype appeared to be an inhibitor for ONFH (OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.23-0.87). Conclusions: Based on the results, ABCB1 polymorphisms were associated with the risk for ONFH.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
