<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Real-Time PCR: Revolutionizing Detection and Expression Analysis of Genes</TITLE><BODY>Invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology by Kary Mullis in 1984 gave birth to real-time PCR. Real-time PCR — detection and expression analysis of gene(s) in real-time — has revolutionized the 21(st) century biological science due to its tremendous application in quantitative genotyping, genetic variation of inter and intra organisms, early diagnosis of disease, forensic, to name a few. We comprehensively review various aspects of real-time PCR, including technological refinement and application in all scientific fields ranging from medical to environmental issues, and to plant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
