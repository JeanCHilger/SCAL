The mouse antibody production test for detection of mouse hepatitis virus was significantly more sensitive than virus isolation in permissive cells, but differences in sensitivity were less marked for the other three viruses. The intrasplenic route of inoculation did not yield seroconversion that occurred earlier or more consistently than that detected after intraperitoneal inoculation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
