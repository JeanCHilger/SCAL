<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1997-11-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Heterogeneous Distribution of the Unusual Phospholipid Semilysobisphosphatidic Acid through the Golgi Complex</TITLE><BODY>To investigate the distribution of lipids through the Golgi complex, we analyzed the envelopes of several viruses that assemble in different subcompartments of the Golgi, as well as subcellular fractions. Our results indicate that each Golgi subcompartment has a distinct phospholipid composition due mainly to differences in the relative amounts of semilysobisphosphatidic acid (SLBPA), sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol. Interestingly, SLBPA is enriched in the adjacent Golgi networks compared with the Golgi stack, and this enrichment varies with cell type. The heterogeneous distribution of SLBPA through the Golgi complex suggests it may play an important role in the structure and/or function of this organelle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
