We tested the hypothesis that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a signal sequence or patch encoded in its cytosolic domain. cDNAs encoding gpI wild type (wt) and a truncated mutant gpI(trc) lacking transmembrane and cytosolic domains were cloned by using the PCR. Cells transfected with cDNA encoding gpI(wt) or gpI(trc) synthesized and N glycosylated the proteins. gpI(wt) accumulated in the TGN, some reached the plasmalemma, but none was secreted. In contrast, gpI(trc) was retained and probably degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum; none was found on cell surfaces, but some was secreted. The distribution of gpI(trc) was not affected by deletion of potential glycosylation sites. To locate a potential gpI-targeting sequence, cells were transfected with cDNA encoding chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain of a plasmalemmal marker, the interleukin-2 receptor (tac), was fused to different domains of gpI. A chimeric protein in which tac was fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gpI was targeted to the TGN. In contrast, a chimeric protein in which tac was fused only with the gpI transmembrane domain passed through the TGN and concentrated in endosomes. We conclude that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a targeting sequence or patch in its cytosolic domain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
