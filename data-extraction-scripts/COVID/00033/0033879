The inner capsid layer of each of these viruses reacted seriologically with sera of children, calves, mice, piglets, and foals convalescent from infection with their respective rotaviruses. These sera reacted by immunofluorescence with human, bovine, porcine, and murine rotaviruses, SA.11, and "O" viruses in tissue cultures and with human bovine, procine, nad murine viral antigens by complement fixation and gel diffusion. However, the antisera differed in their ability to react serologically with the outer capsid layer of the viruses investigated and in their ability to neutralize tissue culture-adapted calf virus. These two tests may demonstrate strain or host specificity among rotaviruses. Since the porcine, murine, and equine viruses are closely related serologically to and are morphologically identical to the human and bovine viruses, they should be included in the group of viruses for which the term "rotavirus" has been suggested. All known members of this proposed group of viruses share a common antigen, probably situated within the inner capsid layer; thus, any one of the viruses may be used for the preparation of antigen or antibody for diagnostic tests, and this will aid in the diagnosis of virus infection in those species from which a rotavirus has not been cultured.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
