After phenotypic characterization of these recombinants, their proteins were studied by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their genomes were analyzed by RNase T1 fingerprinting and partial nucleotide sequencing. Segregation of specific phenotypic and biochemical characteristics inherited from the parental viruses demonstrated that crossing-over could occur in at least four distinct regions of the genome. Possible mechanisms for recombination are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
