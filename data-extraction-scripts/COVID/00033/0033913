When the immunodiffusion test was compared with the virus neutralization test for the detection of transmissible gastroeneritis viral antibodies in 20 swine sera certain samples which contained high titres of virus neutralizing antibodies failed to produce precipitation while other sera were positive in the immunodiffusion test although their virus neutralizing antibody titres were relatively low. Precipitating antibodies were also detected by immunodiffusion in several samples of milk whey from a sow which had been vaccinated with inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
