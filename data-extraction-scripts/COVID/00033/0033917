Considerable genetic heterogeneity was identified, particularly amongst the type 3 isolates, but this genome variation could not be correlated with either clinical or epidemiological findings. Group F adenoviruses were found in 132 (4.1%) of 3202 stool specimens from children with gastroenteritis and, after rotaviruses, they were the most common viruses identified. Unlike rotaviruses, these enteric adenoviruses were endemic throughout the 3-year study period and the greatest proportion of infections (47.6%) were found in babies under 6 months old.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
