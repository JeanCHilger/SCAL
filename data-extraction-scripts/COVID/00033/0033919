Alveolar macrophages were collected sequentially from live calves at multiple time points during the 14 day period following viral inoculation. Alveolar macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were purified by density gradient centrifugation (> 95% AM) prior to in vitro evaluation of cell functions. There were significant but variable and inconsistent differences in the functions of AM from the BRSV inoculated calves compared to the control calves. Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis was either increased or unchanged by BRSV inoculation. Nonopsonized phagocytosis was decreased during the early postinoculation period and later increased. There was a variable effect on AM phagosome lysosome fusion with increased fusion activity on postinoculation days 2 through 5, 7 and 12 but reduced activity on days 6 and 10. The AM respiratory burst, as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, was essentially unaffected with a reduction in activity on day 10 only. In this model, BRSV inoculation of calves primarily resulted in an alteration of the membrane associated phagocytic functions of the alveolar macrophages (p < 0.05).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
