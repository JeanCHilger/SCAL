Apolipoprotein A-I has been shown in rats to be secreted by the intestine as well as the liver. Clinical symptoms such as diarrhea revealed an outbreak of salmonellosis in 22 cows on a farm, and sera were obtained at 6 (acute phase), 16, 28 (convalescent period) and 42 d (postconvalescent period) after the outbreak. Apolipoprotein A-I concentrations (mean +/- SD, mg/mL), determined by ELISA, were 0.598 +/- 0.497 (day 6), 0.111 +/- 0.060 (day 16), 0.432 +/- 0.311 (day 28) and 0.727 +/- 0.516 (day 42). Compared with the concentration at day 42, those at 16 and 28 d were significantly (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) lower, but that at day 6 was not. The serum concentration of apolipoprotein B-100 (of liver origin in cattle) was unaltered during the course of salmonellosis. The concentration of apolipoprotein A-I was positively correlated with those of serum total cholesterol (r = 0.589, P < 0.01) and phospholipids (r = 0.590, P < 0.01). These results suggest that apolipoprotein A-I in cattle is in part of intestinal origin, and also that its decreased serum concentration in salmonellosis can be attributed to the reduced intestinal synthesis or secretion of this apolipoprotein. Moreover, as a potential carrier for dietary lipids such as cholesterol, determination of serum apolipoprotein A-I concentration is suggested to be useful when assessing the nutritional status of the affected cows.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
