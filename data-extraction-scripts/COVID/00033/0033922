Prototypical TBSV DI RNAs contain four noncontiguous segments (regions I through IV) derived from the 5′ nontranslated region (NTR) (I), an internal section (II), and the 3′-terminal portion (III and IV) of the viral genome. We have studied the formation of these molecules by using engineered precursor DI RNA transcripts and report here the consistent accumulation of a novel defective RNA species, designated RNA B. Northern blot, primer extension, and sequence analyses indicated that, unlike prototypical DI RNAs, RNA B lacks region I. In vitro transcripts corresponding to the region II-III-IV structure of RNA B were amplified when coinoculated with helper, indicating that the 5′ NTR of the genome does not harbor cis-acting replication elements essential for viral RNA replication. Region I is, however, important for DI RNA fitness, since molecules lacking it accumulated to significantly lower levels (∼10-fold reduction). Analysis of the minus-strand sequence of region I led to the identification of an RNA undecamer sequence, arranged in tandem, at its very 3′ terminus. Additional variants of the undecamer motif were also identified at internal positions in region I and in the negative strands of regions II, III, and IV. Features of the undecamer motif, the consensus of which is (−)3′-CCCAAAGAGAG, are consistent with a role as a cis-acting replication element. It is proposed that the ability of RNA B to be amplified is due, in part, to compensatory effects of a strategically positioned undecamer motif in region II. Possible replicase-mediated mechanisms for the generation of this novel viral RNA are also presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
