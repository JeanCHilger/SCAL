Groups of five neonatal calves were orally infected at 3 days of age with 10(8) oocysts and maintained in enteric-pathogen-free conditions until clinical disease was established or until the animals had recovered from disease. Age-matched uninfected calves were used for comparison. Ileal mucosal lymphocytes were collected, quantitated, and phenotyped to determine whether changes in lymphocyte composition occurred in infected animals. We observed significantly larger numbers of intraepithelial CD8+ T lymphocytes in ileal mucosae from acutely infected calves compared with those from control animals. In addition, a proportion of intraepithelial CD4+ T cells from acutely infected calves coexpressed CD25, whereas there was an absence of coexpressed CD25 on CD4+ T cells from control calves. Ex vivo reverse transcriptase PCR of RNA from intraepithelial lymphocytes from control calves showed a cytokine expression pattern consisting of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), while intraepithelial lymphocytes from calves with cryptosporidiosis expressed IFN-gamma but not TNF-alpha. Together, the results indicate that changes occur in the ileal intraepithelial lymphocyte population coincidently with Cryptosporidium parvum-induced enteric disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
