<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-07-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Molar Malocclusions in Pine Voles (Microtus pinetorum)</TITLE><BODY>Here we describe 5 cases of molar malocclusions in adult pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) used for behavioral endocrinology studies. This species belongs to the subfamily Microtinae, which possess aradicular hypsodont molars. The abnormal molars identified caused apparent difficulty in mastication, resulting in poor body condition necessitating euthanasia. Postmortem examination of the oral cavity revealed grossly elongated mandibular and maxillary molars with abnormal wear at occlusal surfaces. This colony health problem was addressed successfully by adding autoclaved hardwood sticks to each cage as an enrichment tool.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
