<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Gene Modulation for Treating Liver Fibrosis</TITLE><BODY>Despite tremendous progress in our understanding of fibrogenesis, injury stimuli process, inflammation, and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation, there is still no standard treatment for liver fibrosis. Delivery of small molecular weight drug, proteins and nucleic acids to specific liver cell types remains a challenge due to the overexpression of extra cellular matrix (ECM) and consequent closure of sinusoidal gaps. In addition, activation of HSCs and subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines and infiltration of immune cells are other major obstacles to the treatment of liver fibrosis. To overcome these barriers, different therapeutic approaches are being investigated. Among them, modulation of certain aberrant protein production is quite promising for treating liver fibrosis. In this review, we will describe the mechanism of antisense, antigene and RNA interference (RNAi) therapies, and will discuss how the backbone modification of oligonucleotides affects their in vivo stability, biodistribution and bioactivity. Strategies for delivering these nucleic acids to specific cell types will be discussed. This review will critically address various insights developed in each individual strategy and for multipronged approaches, which will be helpful in achieving better outcomes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
