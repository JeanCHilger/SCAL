The high frequency of neoplastic and degenerative diseases observed among older animals in closed colonies of M. natalensis were not observed in the wild animals studied. This is probably a reflection of the age distribution of the study population, since the life expectancy of wild Mastomys is less than a year. Inflammatory lesions were nonetheless identified, some of which were similar to those described in laboratory colonies. Frequent lesions were myocarditis (54%), myositis (32%), interstitial pneumonitis (50%), intercapillary glomerulosclerosis (36%), and acute nephrosis (14%). Follicular and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia were evident in the spleen (74%) and Peyer's patches (64%). Lymphoid cell accumulations were prominent in the salivary glands (36%), periportal hepatic region (25%), lungs (32%), perivascular regions (36%), and kidney (21%). Cytomegalic inclusion body sialoadenitis was common (25%). Coccidiosis was evident in the intestinal tract (25%), kidney (25%), and muscle (21%). One neoplasm, a parahepatic haemangioma, was observed histologically. Mean body weights and lengths for virus-positive animals (33 g and 9.2 cm) and virus-negative animals (54 g and 12.2 cm) showed that virus-positive animals were smaller in weight and shorter in length. Since the age of the animals could not be determined, these differences remain unexplained. In comparison with virus-negative animals, virus-positive Mastomys had higher frequencies of splenic follicular hyperplasia (82% against 50%), myocarditis (79% against 29%), perivascular lymphoid cell accumulation (57% against 7%), myositis (50% against 14%), and cytomegalic inclusion body sialoadenitis (36% against 14%). The frequency of lymphoid hyperplasia of Peyer's patches was high in both groups of animals (71% and 57%). The presence of Lassa virus, small size, myocarditis, and lymphoid perivasculitis appeared to be interrelated, but larger and better controlled studies are required to elucidate the relationship.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
