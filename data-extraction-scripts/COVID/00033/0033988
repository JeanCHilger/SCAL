We determined whether HSV-1 and PRV use the same cellular components during entry into Vero cells, which are highly susceptible to each virus but are not from native hosts for either. UV-inactivated virions of either HSV-1 or PRV could saturate cell surfaces to block infection of challenge HSV-1 or PRV. In the presence of saturating levels for infection of either virus, radiolabeled virus bound well and in a heparin-sensitive manner. This result shows that heparan sulfate proteoglycans on Vero cells are not the limiting cellular component. To identify the virus component required for blocking, we used an HSV-1 null mutant virus lacking gB, gD, or gH as blocking virus. Virions lacking gB were able to block infection of challenge virus to the same level as did virus containing gB. In contrast, virions lacking gD lost all and most of the ability to block infection of HSV-1 and PRV, respectively. HSV-1 lacking gH and PRV lacking gp50 also were less competent in blocking infection of challenge virus. We conclude that HSV-1 and PRV bind to a common receptor for infection of Vero cells. Although both viruses bind a heparin-like cell component on many cells, including Vero cells, they also attach to a different and limited cell surface component that is bound at least by HSV-1 gD and possibly gH and to some degree by PRV gp50 but not gB. These results clearly demonstrate binding of both HSV-1 and PRV to a common cell receptor that is not heparan sulfate and demonstrate that several types of attachment occur for both viruses during infectious entry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
