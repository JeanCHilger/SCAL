Murine cytomegalovirus, tagged with the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, was used to identify cells in which virus replicates during acute infection of immunocompetent mice. Recombinant murine cytomegaloviruses, RM461, RM460, and RM427, were constructed to express beta-galactosidase under control of the human cytomegalovirus ie1/ie2 promoter/enhancer. The lacZ gene was inserted between the ie2 and sgg1 genes in RM461 and RM460, disrupting a 0.85-kb late transcript that was found to be dispensable for replication in cultured cells as well as for infection of mice. In BALB/c mice, lacZ-tagged and wild-type viruses exhibited a similar 50% lethal dose and all had the capacity to latently infect the spleen. Peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes were the major infected leukocyte cell type, as demonstrated by the ability of infected cells to adhere to glass and to phagocytize latex beads; however, these cells did not exhibit typical monocyte markers. Plaque assay for virus and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining of frozen sections of organs from infected mice revealed that the major target organs included the spleen, adrenal glands, liver, and salivary glands, although tissues as diverse as brown fat and lungs were also involved. Individual blue-staining cells were readily identified in all infected tissues. These studies identified a mononuclear phagocyte, possibly a macrophage or dendritic cell precursor, as the vehicle of virus dissemination during acute infection, and demonstrate the utility of using lacZ-tagged murine cytomegalovirus for tropism, pathogenesis, and latency studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
