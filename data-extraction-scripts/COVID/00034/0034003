<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1994-03-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Crystal structure of an idiotype-anti-idiotype Fab complex.</TITLE><BODY>Anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody 409.5.3 is raised against an antibody that neutralizes feline infectious peritonitis virus. This antibody, used as an immunogen, elicits the production of anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies that in turn neutralize the virus. The crystal structure of the complex between anti-idiotypic Fab 409.5.3 and idiotypic Fab fragment of virus-neutralizing antibody has been solved by molecular replacement using real-space Patterson search and filtering by Patterson correlation-coefficient refinement. The structure has been refined to an R value of 0.21 based on 21,310 unique reflections between 40.0 and 2.9 A. The three-dimensional structure reveals extensive, specific interactions that involve 118 van der Waals contacts and at least 9 probable hydrogen bonds. The two Fabs are rotated 61 degrees with respect to each other around the approximate long axis of the complex and are within 26 degrees being aligned along their major axes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
