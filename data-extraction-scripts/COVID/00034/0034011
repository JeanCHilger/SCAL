The budding compartment is thought to be determined by the accumulation of the two heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the Golgi. We recently mapped the retention signal for Golgi localization in one Bunyaviridae member (Uukuniemi virus) to the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We now show that a myc-tagged 81-residue G1 tail peptide expressed in BHK21 cells is efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and retained there during a 3-h chase. Green-fluorescence protein tagged at either end with this peptide or with a C-terminally truncated 60-residue G1 tail peptide was also efficiently targeted to the Golgi. The 81-residue peptide colocalized with mannosidase II (a medial Golgi marker) and partially with p58 (an intermediate compartment marker) and TGN38 (a trans-Golgi marker). In addition, the 81-residue tail peptide induced the formation of brefeldin A-resistant vacuoles that did not costain with markers for other membrane compartments. Removal of the first 10 N-terminal residues had no effect on the Golgi localization but abolished the vacuolar staining. The shortest peptide still able to become targeted to the Golgi encompassed residues 10 to 40. Subcellular fractionation showed that the 81-residue tail peptide was associated with microsomal membranes. Removal of the two palmitylation sites from the tail peptide did not affect Golgi localization and had only a minor effect on the association with microsomal membranes. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that Golgi retention of the heterodimeric G1-G2 spike protein complex of Uukuniemi virus is mediated by a short region in the cytoplasmic tail of the G1 glycoprotein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
