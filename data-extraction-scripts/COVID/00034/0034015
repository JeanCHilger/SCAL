Viral growth was confirmed by titration of the passage material in other susceptible host systems. Nineteen viruses demonstrated good growth in C6/36 cells: coxsackievirus group A type 10 and group B types 2, 3, 4, and 5; enterovirus 69; mumps virus; poliovirus types 1 to 3; reovirus types 1 to 3; vaccinia virus; dengue virus type 2; eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus; La Crosse virus; Rocio virus; and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Ten viruses did not adapt to growth in the C6/36 cultures. Seventeen other virus strains displayed only limited growth which was primarily restricted to the initial C6/36 passage or was detected by hemagglutinin reactions without observable cell degeneration. Of the 46 viruses, 33 (72%) were capable of initiating infection with a demonstrable cytopathic effect in the initial C6/36 passage. Hemagglutination or complement fixation titers or both were obtained with dengue virus type 2, eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, La Crosse virus, mumps virus, reovirus types 1 to 3, and Rocio, St. Louis encephalitis, and vaccinia viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
