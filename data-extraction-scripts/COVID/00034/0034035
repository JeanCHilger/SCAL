The piglets were infected with virulent TGEV and the sera were given orally 3 h before infection, together with the virus, and every 6 h postinfection during the 30 h of the experiment. Virus shedding was monitored by TGEV isolation from rectal swab samples. The sera containing antibodies induced by the complete S protein or the amino terminal half of the S protein showed protective properties, indicated by delayed onset of clinical signs and virus shedding, similar to the TGEV hyperimmune serum. Those immune sera containing antibodies induced by shorter recombinant proteins were not protective.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
