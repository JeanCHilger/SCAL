Adult, athymic nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1(rnu)) were implanted with HeLa human cervical or HT29 colon adenocarcinomas and grown as tissue-isolated xenografts. When tumors reached an estimated weight of 5 to 6 g, rats were prepared for perfusion with donor blood and arteriovenous measurements. The surgical procedure required approximately 20 min to complete for each tumor, and tumors were perfused for a period of 150 min. Results showed that tumor venous blood flow, glucose uptake, lactic acid release, O(2) uptake and CO(2) production, uptake of total fatty acid and linoleic acid and conversion to the mitogen 13-HODE, cAMP levels, and activation of several marker kinases were all well within the normal physiologic, metabolic, and signaling parameters characteristic of individually perfused xenografts. This new perfusion system and technique reduced procedure time by more than 50%. These findings demonstrate that 2 human tumors can be perfused simultaneously in situ or ex vivo by using either rodent or human blood and suggest that the system may also be adapted for use in the dual perfusion of other organs. Advantages of this dual perfusion technique include decreased anesthesia time, decreased surgical manipulation, and increased efficiency, thereby potentially reducing the numbers of laboratory animals required for scientific investigations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
