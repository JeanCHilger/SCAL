Protoplasts inoculated with transcripts derived from a PVX cDNA clone or from clones containing mutations in their 5' nontranslated regions (NTRs) were assayed for RNA production by S1 nuclease protection assays. A time course of plus- and minus-strand-RNA accumulation indicated that both minus- and plus-strand PVX RNAs were detectable at 0.5 h postinoculation. Although minus-strand RNAs accumulated more rapidly than plus-strand RNAs, maximum levels of plus-strand RNAs were 40- to 80-fold higher. On the basis of these data, time points were chosen for determination of RNA levels in protoplasts inoculated with PVX clones containing deletions or an insertion in their 5' NTRs. Deletions of more than 12 nucleotides from the 5' end, internal deletions, and one insertion in the 5' NTR resulted in substantially decreased levels of plus-strand-RNA production. In contrast, all modified transcripts were functional for minus-strand-RNA synthesis, suggesting that elements in the 5' NTR were not essential for minus-strand-RNA synthesis. Further analysis of the 5' NTR deletion mutants indicated that all mutations that decreased genomic plus-strand-RNA synthesis also decreased synthesis of the two major subgenomic RNAs. These data indicate that cis-acting elements from different regions of the 5' NTR are required for plus-strand-RNA synthesis and that this process may be linked to synthesis of subgenomic RNAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
