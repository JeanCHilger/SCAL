The disease was characterized clinically by erythema and cracking and bleeding of the perianal skin associated with the excretion of poorly formed fecal pellets, liquid, and gas. Light microscopy-observable changes consisted of small intestinal villous atrophy, villous epithelial necrosis, and villous epithelial syncytial cell formation. The cytoplasm of the epithelial syncytial cells contained large numbers of 80-nm viral particles that were often associated with reticular aggregates of electron-dense material. Viral infection principally involved the luminal one-fourth to one-third of the intestinal villi as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. This rotavirus-like agent contained 11 double-stranded RNA segments; however, the migration pattern of these segments in polyacrylamide gels differed from the electrophoretic pattern which is characteristic of the typical rotaviruses. The agent had a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.36 to 1.4 g/cm3 and was labile at pH 3 and at 56 degrees C; however, infectivity of viral inocula was not altered by extensive treatment with ether or by pH 5 buffers. This disease, which we have named infectious diarrhea of infant rats, is the first recognized viral diarrhea of rats and appears to be a good model for the study of the recently recognized group of atypical rotaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
