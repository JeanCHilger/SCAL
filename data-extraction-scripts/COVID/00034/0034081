<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1985-10-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Serotypes of bovine astrovirus.</TITLE><BODY>Three isolates of bovine astrovirus, one from the United Kingdom and two from the United States, possessed common antigens by immunofluorescence and strain-specific antigens by neutralization and were designated as two, and probably three, distinct serotypes. The isolate US2, despite being a different serotype, possessed the same restrictive cell tropism and cytopathology as previously reported for isolate US1, of the M cells of the dome epithelium of the Peyer's patches. Serotyping of 16 field isolates indicated the presence of more undefined serotypes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
