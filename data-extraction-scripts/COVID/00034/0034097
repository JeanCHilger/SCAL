<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009</DATELINE><TITLE>The Identification, Characterization and Optimization of Small Molecule Probes of Cysteine Proteases: Experiences of the Penn Center for Molecular Discovery with Cathepsin B and Cathepsin L</TITLE><BODY>During the pilot phase of the NIH Molecular Library Screening Network, the Penn Center for Molecular Discovery focused on a series of projects aimed at high throughput screening and the development of probes of a variety of protease targets. This review provides our medicinal chemistry experience with two such targets â€“ cathepsin B and cathepsin L. We describe our approach for hit validation, characterization and triage that led to a critical understanding of the nature of hits from the cathepsin B project. In addition, we detail our experience at hit identification and optimization that led to the development of a novel thiocarbazate probe of cathepsin L.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
