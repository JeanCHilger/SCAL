Detection of HRVLA in stools is impractical with the techniques currently available. We describe a rapid immunofluorescence assay for detection of HRVLA in stools. Results with this assay agreed well with results obtained from examination of stool specimens by electron microscopy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
