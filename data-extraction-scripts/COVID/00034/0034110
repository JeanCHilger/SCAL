Hemagglutination of guinea pig and African green monkey red blood cells was obtained with clarified intestinal contents. Two isolates were found to be antigenically related to porcine and canine parvoviruses, while another differed from the porcine parvovirus using the hemagglutination-inhibition test. Three isolates could be cultivated in cell cultures as demonstrated by the development of a cytopathic effect, hemagglutination activity, immunofluorescence and identification of the virions in the cell culture fluids by electron microscopy. The possibility of a primary etiological role for these parvoviruses in diarrhea of unweaned piglets is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
