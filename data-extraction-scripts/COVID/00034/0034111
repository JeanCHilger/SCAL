Studies on culture and identity.</TITLE><BODY>Attempts were made to isolate viruses from babies' stools that contained adenoviruses detected by electron microscopy. One hundred and fifty-nine specimens from 71 children were studied and adenoviruses of established serotypes were isolated from 81 stools. Serial stool samples containing adenovirus particles were obtained from 35 children, and prolonged shedding of recognized serotypes was common. Simultaneous and sequential infections by different serotypes were also observed. Thirty-six children shed adenoviruses that could not be isolated using cell cultures normally used to detect adenoviruses, and nine of these children also shed adenoviruses of established serotypes. Passage in Chang conjunctival cell culture allowed characterization of fastidious adenoviruses from 14 children as members of a previously unrecognized serotype.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
