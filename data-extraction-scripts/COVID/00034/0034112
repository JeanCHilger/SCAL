We found that all but one of the oligonucleotides were mapped at the positions within each mRNA consistent with the nested-set, stairlike structure of mouse hepatitis virus mRNA (Lai et al., J. Virol. 39:823-834). However, one oligonucleotide, 10, was mapped near the 5' ends of every mRNA and virion genomic RNA. In other words, oligonucleotide 10 and, therefore, the sequences around the 5' ends of the mRNAs are not colinear with the genomic sequences. Because this oligonucleotide is present only once in the genomic RNA, this result indicates that oligonucleotide 10 is not transcribed from multiple sites on the genomic template, but rather represents a leader RNA sequence which is joined to the body sequences of the different mRNAs during mRNA transcription. This provides the most direct evidence thus far for the presence of leader sequences in the mRNAs of mouse hepatitis virus, which is a cytoplasmic virus. Several possible mechanisms of RNA synthesis are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
