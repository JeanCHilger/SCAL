This recombinant virus expresses two glycoproteins which are similar to the HTN structural glycoproteins, G1 and G2, in molecular weight, cleavage pattern, and cellular distribution. Both HTN and recombinant vaccinia virus glycoproteins are exclusively associated with the Golgi apparatus of the cell. Despite this intracellular restriction, mice inoculated with the recombinant vaccinia virus raised neutralizing antibodies against HTN. The specificity of virus neutralization appears to reside in the HTN glycoproteins, since a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the HTN nucleocapsid protein was unable to elicit a neutralizing antibody response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
