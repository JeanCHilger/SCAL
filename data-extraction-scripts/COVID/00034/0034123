Spleen cells, expanded in vitro by stimulation with M41, were immortalized by fusion to obtain T-cell hybridomas, and two major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II (I-E)-restricted T-cell hybridomas were selected with specificity for IBV. Both hybridomas selectively recognized the internal nucleocapsid protein. The responses to 12 different strains of IBV varied markedly. This demonstrates antigenic variation of the nucleocapsid protein in addition to the known variation of the surface glycoprotein S.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
