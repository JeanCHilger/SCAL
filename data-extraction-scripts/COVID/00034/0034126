Development of antiviral antibodies requires the presence of CD4+ T cells but appears to play a minimal role in the reduction of virus. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that clearance of JHM virus is mediated by virus-specific CD8+ T cells, which appear to require the presence of CD4+ T cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
