Normal or FIV-infected autologous and allogeneic T lymphoblastoid cells were used as target cells in chromium-51 or indium-111 release assays. When effector cells consisted of either fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells or concanavalin A- and interleukin-2-stimulated cells, only low levels of cytotoxicity were observed. However, the levels of FIV-specific cytotoxicity were consistently higher in both groups of cats following in vitro stimulation of the effector cells with irradiated, FIV-infected autologous T lymphoblastoid cells and interleukin-2. The effector cells lysed autologous but not allogeneic FIV-infected target cells and were composed predominantly of CD8+ T cells, indicating that the FIV-specific cytotoxicity measured in this system is mediated by CD8+, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted T cells. These studies show that FIV-specific cytolytic T cells can be detected as early as 7 to 9 weeks postinfection, and they define a system to identify virus-encoded epitopes important in the induction of protective immunity against lentiviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
