To detect the possible cellular proteins involved in the replication of mouse hepatitis virus RNA, we performed RNA-protein binding studies with RNAs representing both the 5' and 3' ends of the viral genomic RNA and the 3' end of the negative-strand complementary RNA. Gel-retardation assays showed that both the 5'-end-positive- and 3'-end-negative-strand RNA formed an RNA-protein complex with cellular proteins from the uninfected cells. UV cross-linking experiments further identified a 55-kDa protein bound to the 5' end of the positive-strand viral genomic RNA and two proteins 35 and 38 kDa in size bound to the 3' end of the negative-strand cRNA. The results of the competition assay confirmed the specificity of this RNA-protein binding. No proteins were found to bind to the 3' end of the viral genomic RNA under the same conditions. The binding site of the 55-kDa protein was mapped within the 56-nucleotide region from nucleotides 56 to 112 from the 5' end of the positive-strand RNA, and the 35- and 38-kDa proteins bound to the complementary region on the negative-strand RNA. The 38-kDa protein was detected only in DBT cells but was not detected in HeLa or COS cells, while the 35-kDa protein was found in all three cell types. The juxtaposition of the different cellular proteins on the complementary sites near the ends of the positive- and negative-strand RNAs suggests that these proteins may interact with each other and play a role in mouse hepatitis virus RNA replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
