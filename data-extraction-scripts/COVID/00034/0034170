Both SN tests used a 24 h incubation of test sera with 100 CCID50 of BHV-1 before the addition of susceptible cells. The tests differed in the presence (C test) or absence (D test) of complement and were compared with a standard 1 h incubation SN test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although the mean titer of the C test was twofold higher than the mean titer of the D test for 310 sera, the number of samples which were negative was not significantly different between tests. For 100 sera from herds with known reactors, which were negative in a 1 h incubation SN test, 32% tested positive in the C and D tests. Other investigations, including Western immunoblotting and radioimmune precipitation, suggest that the 24 h incubation tests produce some false positive results. In contrast, the 1 h incubation SN test and, to a much lesser extent, the ELISA appear to produce some false negative results. The C test was more sensitive than the D test for detecting an early immune response after experimental infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
