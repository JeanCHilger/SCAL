In this report we compared the characteristics of the inflammatory response on spinal cord injury (SCI) caused by a stab wound between the T7 and T9 vertebrae and spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). SCI and EAE were compared in two types of myelin basic protein Ac1-11-specific T-cell receptor transgenic mice: T/R(+) mice harbor regulatory T cells, and T/R(−) mice lack regulatory T cells. Our results show that 8 days after SCI, T/R(−) mice developed a strong T-cell infiltrate in the spinal cord, with remarkable down-modulation of CD4 expression that was accompanied by a local increase in Mac-3(+) and F4/80(+) reactivity and diffuse local and distal astrogliosis. In contrast, T/R(+) mice exhibited a modest increase in CD4(+) cells localized to the site of injury, without CD4 down-modulation; focal astrogliosis was restricted to the site of the lesion, although Mac-3(+) and F4/80(+) cells were also present. Similarly to T/R(−) mice that underwent SCI, T cells displaying down-modulated CD4 expression were found in the CNS of older T/R(−) mice afflicted by spontaneous EAE. Overall, our results suggest that common mechanisms regulate T-cell accumulation in CNS lesions of different causes, such as mechanic lesion or autoimmune-mediated damage.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
