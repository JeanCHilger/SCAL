Most of the selected sequences could be folded as imperfect hairpins and displayed a 5'-GUCCCAGA-3' consensus motif constituting the apical loop. The six central bases of this consensus sequence are complementary to the entire TAR loop, leading to the formation of TAR RNA-aptamer "kissing" complexes. The consensus G and A residues closing the aptamer loop contributed to the high affinity (Kd = 30 nM at 23 degrees C) of the aptamers for the TAR RNA. This G A pair was shown to be crucial for binding to TAR at a low magnesium concentration. The selection also identified 5'-PuPy and 5'-PyPu base pairs at alpha and beta positions of the stem, next to the loop, respectively. This strategy offered a way to identify key determinants of loop-loop interactions and to generate high affinity ligands of TAR RNA structure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
