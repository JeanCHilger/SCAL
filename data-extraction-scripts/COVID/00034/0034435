<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection with acute kidney injury</TITLE><BODY>COVID-19 is a newly discovered class B infectious disease. It is characterized by virus infected pneumonia, accompanying with dysfunction in multiple organs including kidney, heart, blood, and nerve system. Since its outbreak in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has now spread to more than 20 countries and regions all over the world, and World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19, like previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is also caused by coronavirus infection, and acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the important complications of the disease. Timely prevention and treatment of AKI is critical for patients with COVID-19. Here the Chinese Society of Nephrology organized a group of experts in nephrology to summarize the features of COVID-19 related AKI including epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and more importantly, to propose suggestions on diagnosis and treatment of this highly contagious disease. It is our hope to raise clinical concern about management of AKI so as to improve the outcome of patients with COVID-19.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
