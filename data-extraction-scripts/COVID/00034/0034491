Methods A multi-center prospective study was carried out to compare the effect of triple combination antiviral therapy with dual combination antiviral therapy in 15 medical institutions of Zhejiang Province. All patients were treated with recombinant interferon &alpha;-2b (5 million U, 2 times/d) aerosol inhalation. 196 patients were treated with abidol (200 mg, 3 times/d) + lopinavir / ritonavir (2 tablets, 1 time/12 h) as the triple combination antiviral treatment group. 41 patients were treated with lopinavir / ritonavir (2 tablets, 1 time/12 h) as the dual combination antiviral treatment group. The patients who received triple combination antiviral therapy were divided into three groups: within 48 hours, 3-5 days and &gt; 5 days after the symptom onset. To explore the therapeutic effects of triple combination antiviral drugs and dual combination antiviral drugs, as well as triple combination antiviral drugs with different antiviral initiate time. SPSS17.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results The time of virus nucleic acid turning negative was (12.2 &plusmn; 4.7) days in the triple combination antiviral drug group, which was shorter than that in the dual combination antiviral drug group [(15.0 &plusmn; 5.0) days] ( t = 6.159, P &lt; 0.01 ). The length of hospital stay [12 (9, 17) d] in the triple combination antiviral drug group was also shorter than that in the dual combination antiviral drug group [15 (10, 18) d] (H = 2.073, P &lt; 0.05). Comparing the antiviral treatment which was started within 48 hours, 3-5 days and &gt; 5 days after the symptom onset of triple combination antiviral drug group, the time from the symptom onset to the negative of viral shedding was 13 (10,16.8), 17 (13,22) and 21 (18-24) days respectively (Z = 32.983, P &lt; 0.01), and the time from antiviral therapy to the negative of viral shedding was (11.8&plusmn;3.9) , (13.5&plusmn;5.1) and (11.2&plusmn;4.3) d. The differences among the three groups were statistically significant (Z=32.983 and 6.722, P &lt;0.01 or&lt;0.05). Conclusions The triple combination antiviral therapy of Abidor, Lopinavir/Litonavir and recombinant interferon &alpha;-2b showed shorter viral shedding time and hospitalization time compared with the dual combination antiviral therapy. The earlier the time to initiate triple antiviral treatment, the shorter the time of virus shedding.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
