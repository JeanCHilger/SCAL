Methods Analyze the clinical data, laboratory examination and chest imaging characteristics of 153 COVID-19 patients in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from January 26 to February 5, 2020. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria ,patients were divided into non-severe group(n=132) and severe group(n=21),and analyze the correlation between serum index changes and disease severity. Results Combined with diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, the severity of the disease was statistically significant ( &chi; 2 =11.04&#21644;6.94, P &lt;0.05). No symptoms were found in patients with mild illness ( &chi; 2 =4.09, P &lt;0.05) .The proportion of fever and muscle soreness in the severe group was higher than that in the non-severe group ( &chi; 2 =4.40 and 22.67, P &lt;0.05).Among the concomitant symptoms, the proportion of cough and shortness of breath in the severe group was higher than that in the non-severe group ( &chi; 2 =8.46 and 4.80, P &lt;0.05).C-reactive protein and d-dimer were higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group ( t =43.44 and 37.13, P &lt;0.05), and the number of CD 3 + T lymphocyte cells, CD 4 + T lymphocyte cells and CD 8 + T lymphocyte cells in the severe group was lower than that in the non-severe group (Z=27.25, 20.60 and 17.36, P &lt;0.05).Compared with the non-severe group, both lungs and the right lung lower lobe were more susceptible to involved ( &chi; 2 =6.95&#21644;20.39, P &lt;0.05) . Conclusion Severity of COVID-19 was associated with underlying disease, symptoms, site of involvement, C-reactive protein, d-dimer, CD 3 + T lymphocyte count, CD 4 + T lymphocyte count, and CD 8 + T lymphocyte count.&nbsp;&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
