<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Attention should be paid to the exposure risk of patients with chronic wounds on the way to hospital during corona virus disease 2019 epidemic prevention and control</TITLE><BODY>Statistics show that 76.74% (4 688) of 6 109 patients with chronic wounds are those over 50 years of age; the proportion of patients with underlying diseases in all age groups above 50 years ranges from 78.25% to 100.00%; among the underlying diseases of chronic wound patients, the top four diseases are diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, and respiratory diseases. The above underlying diseases and ages of patients are the susceptibility factors of corona virus disease 2019 released by National Health Commission of China. It is an unavoidable fact that patients with chronic wounds have to go to the hospital for treatment prescribed&nbsp;by the physician. At the same time, we found that there were not a few patients who go far afield because of various reasons when go to the hospital for treatment. During the period of epidemic prevention and control, this kind of 'go far afield' style of seeking medical treatment may increase the exposure risk during transportation. Accordingly, we convened 36 wound care clinics in different regions in Shanghai to implement the 'Five Measures' to encourage patients with chronic wounds to seek medical treatment proximately. The principle of this operation is that when seeking medical treatment, trying our best to reduce as much as possible the transportation distance for patients with chronic wounds to minimize the exposure risk during the epidemic period and eventually support the epidemic prevention and control campaign.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
