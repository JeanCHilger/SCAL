Relevant databases such as China Knowledge Net, Weipu, Wanfang and other related databases were searched with the keywords of "new coronavirus pneumonia", "children", and "critical severity" as of February 8, 2020. This case is the first child with severe NCP in China. It started with gastrointestinal symptoms, early respiratory symptoms were not obvious, and rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient was negative for nucleic acid test of 2019 new-type coronavirus (2019-nCoV) for 2 consecutive consecutive throat swabs. For severe suspected cases, it is recommended to take samples of the lower respiratory tract or repeat samples of the upper respiratory tract for testing. Continuous blood purification technology can be applied to the treatment of children with severe NCP as early as possible.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
