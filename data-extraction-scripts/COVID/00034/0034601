<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Research on the prevention and control of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia for Internet-based hospitals using UTAUT-DST model</TITLE><BODY>Thanks to the transmission characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, Internet-based hospitals can effectively cut off the transmission route via online consulting service. The hospital, leveraging the UTAUT model and DST theory, and advantages of Internet-based hospitals, is deploying step by step such four modules, as 'pre-hospital screening', 'patient acceptance', 'auxiliary diagnosis and treatment', and 'prevention and control linkage'. These efforts ultimately contribute to an innovative prevention and control pattern against the novel coronary pneumonia for Internet-based hospitals and based on the UTAUT-DST model. This practice proves an initial success, and offers useful references for prevention and control of the NCP and development of other Internet-based hospitals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
