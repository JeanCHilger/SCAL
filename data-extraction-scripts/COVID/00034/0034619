It is characterized by untypical clinical symptoms, long incubation period, concealment and strong infectivity. Patients usually have no specific symptoms at the early stage, or even have no symptoms, but they are infectious. The main route of the disease is droplet and contact transmission, and there is the possibility of transmission of fecal mouth and gas thrombolysis. In the diagnosis and treatment process of outpatient and inpatient in foot and ankle surgery department, detailed consultation, strict physical examination and full contact with patients are needed, so the risk of cross infection is very high. To prevent and control of cross infection from patient to patient, patient to medical staff, or medical staff to each other, the paper aims to introduce the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative prevention and control program in the process of diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, based on abundant clinical experience of dealing with COVID-19 from medical staffs and evidence-based therapies, many experts discussed sufficiently and eventually reached the expert consensus on clinical diagnosis and treatment in foot and ankle surgery department. It can provide some references for medical staffs to avoid cross infection of COVID-19.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
