<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Research progress on nucleic acid detection in Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia</TITLE><BODY>The prevention and control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia caused by Novel Coronavirus is at a critical period. Nucleic acid detection, as the definite diagnosis tool, plays an important role in rapid diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, epidemic prevention and control. However, the disease is outbreak, and the time of nucleic acid detection in clinical application is short. So the insufficient method verification and clinical evaluation has been made. 'False negative' is observed in clinical practice, and the result of nucleic acid detection is not matched with the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, it is urgent to optimize the current methods and improve detection sensitivity. Based on latest studies of Novel Coronavirus, this article reviews the current status and application prospects of nucleic acid detection. Also, this article provides references for clinicians and researchers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
