<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Gerbils</TITLE><BODY>The gerbil is usually nonaggressive and is one of the easiest rodents to maintain and handle. Its disposition, curious nature, relative freedom from naturally occurring infectious diseases, and adaptability to its environment have contributed to its popularity as a laboratory animal. Gerbils are found in deserts and semiarid geographical regions of the world. The Mongolian gerbils that are available today originated from 20 pairs of captured animals that were maintained in 1935 in a closed, random-bred colony at the Kitasato Institute in Japan. Gerbils have several unique anatomical and physiological features. Mature gerbils are smaller than rats, but larger than mice. Mongolian gerbils are attracted to saliva and use salivary cues to discriminate between siblings and nonsiblings, and females use oral cues in the selection of sociosexual partners. Gerbils have been used as experimental models in a number of areas of biomedical research. Gerbils are excellent subjects for laboratory animal research as they are susceptible to bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens that affect humans and other species. Gerbils may have spontaneous seizures secondary to stress such as handling, cage change, abrupt noises, or changes in the environment. Cystic ovaries are seen commonly in female gerbils over 1 year of age. Gerbils have unique characteristics, which make them appropriate for a number of animal models. Classically, gerbils have been used in research involving stroke, parasitology, infectious diseases, epilepsy, brain development and behavior, and hearing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
