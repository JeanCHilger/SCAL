OBJECTIVES: This study examined the use of chemically modified siRNAs in a mouse model of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. METHODS: Chemically modified siRNAs were designed and screened in a cell-based reporter assay. The most potent siRNAs were then screened in bone marrow–derived mast cells to demonstrate efficacy in primary cells. RESULTS: A candidate siRNA was formulated and administered to sensitized mice just before airway challenge with allergen. Administration of the siRNA was shown to reduce airway resistance significantly in sensitized and challenged mice by 60%, whereas a control siRNA had no effect. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing targeted siRNAs to prevent induction of allergen-induced airway dysfunction and suggest potential therapeutic applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
