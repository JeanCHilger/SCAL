Early attempts at vaccination have been unsuccessful, some even serving to exacerbate the disease through antibody-dependent enhancement. Replication-incompetent feline foamy virus (FFV) transducing vectors are being developed as potential vaccine agents, into which immunogenic fragments of feline coronavirus (FCoV) proteins will be inserted. To use a recombinant viral vector to express FCoV proteins, the agent chosen should be apathogenic and replication incompetent within the host following gene delivery. Spumaviruses confer several advantages over the more traditionally explored retroviral vectors. Stable helper cell line clones have been established by transfection of CRFK cells with FFV tas and assessed using β-galactosidase assays, PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. The generation of infectious virions using these cell lines has been investigated using tas-deleted FFV vectors containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) cassette.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
