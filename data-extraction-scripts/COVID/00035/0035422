<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-08-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Structure-Based Design and Synthesis of Triazole-based Macrocyclic Inhibitors of Norovirus Protease: Structural, Biochemical, Spectroscopic, and Antiviral Studies</TITLE><BODY>Outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis caused by noroviruses constitute a public health concern worldwide. To date, there are no approved drugs or vaccines for the management and prophylaxis of norovirus infections. A potentially effective strategy for the development of norovirus therapeutics entails the discovery of inhibitors of norovirus 3CL protease, an enzyme essential for noroviral replication. We describe herein the structure-based design of the first class of permeable, triazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3C-like protease, as well as pertinent X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, spectroscopic, and antiviral studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
