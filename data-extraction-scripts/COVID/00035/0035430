Process reengineering in purchasing, materials management, work practices, and waste management can reduce environmental hazards and contain costs at the healthcare facilities. This paper demonstrates an application of the RFID-enabled process reengineering in sustainable healthcare system design, and presents a case study in the linens division of central sterilization services department at a Singaporean hospital using ARENA simulation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
