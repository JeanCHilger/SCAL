<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Infectious Diseases</TITLE><BODY>Although guinea pigs are sensitive and susceptible to the development of lesions from a wide range of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and parasites, only a small number of organisms cause natural infection and only a portion of that group cause clinical disease. This chapter discusses naturally occurring diseases of guinea pigs, although some data from experimental infections have also been covered as they relate to the pathogenesis of the disease. The material presented includes background, etiology, epizootiology/pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, pathology, diagnosis, prevention, and therapy. The diseases are discussed in an alphabetical order based on the taxonomic groups to which the organisms belong and are independent of the order of perceived importance of the various diseases. The Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations recommends monitoring for guinea pig adenovirus, guinea pig cytomegalovirus, Sendai virus, ectoparasites, endoparasites, E. cunniculi, and a variety of bacteria including Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydia psittaci, Corynebacterium kutscheri, dermatophytes, Pasteurellaceae, Salmonella, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Streptococcus, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Clostridium piliforme. Virus-associated necrotizing ronchopneumonia in guinea pigs is a spontaneous multifactorial disease that has low morbidity, high mortality, and a worldwide distribution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
