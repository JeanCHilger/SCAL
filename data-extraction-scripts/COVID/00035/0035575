DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort case series. METHODS: Ninety eyes from 45 patients with the diagnosis of SARS during an epidemic outbreak in Hong Kong were analyzed. Relevant medical and ophthalmic histories were taken. Ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp, and indirect ophthalmoscopy examination, were performed at baseline and at 2-month and 3-month follow-up. SETTING: Faculty practice in university hospital. RESULTS: Only two patients had mild elevated intraocular pressure at baseline and at subsequent follow-up. There was no loss of visual acuity, cataract progression, or increased cupâ€“disk ratio. Fundus examinations were unremarkable in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not demonstrate any ocular manifestations in patients with SARS. The treatment regimen of high-dose corticosteroid also did not show any significant ocular complications. Routine ocular screening of patients with SARS for diagnosis or for complications might not be indicated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
