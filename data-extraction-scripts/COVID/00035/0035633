<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>The other side of the coin: Leveraging Epsteinâ€“Barr virus in research and therapy</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Epstein-Barr virus is (EBV) a ubiquitous virus prevalent in 90% of the human population. Transmitted through infected saliva, EBV is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and is further implicated in malignancies of lymphoid and epithelial origins. In the past few decades, research efforts primarily focused on dissecting the mechanism of EBV-induced oncogenesis. Here, we present an alternate facet of the oncovirus EBV, on its applications in research and therapy. Finally, discussions on the prospective utilization of EBV in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) diagnosis and therapy will also be presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
