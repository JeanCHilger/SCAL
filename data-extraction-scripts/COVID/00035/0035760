Nucleic acid amplification tests have improved the ability to identify respiratory viruses in clinical specimens and have played pivotal roles in the rapid characterization of new viral pathogens. Antigen-detection assays in immunochromatographic or similar formats are most easily developed as near-patient tests, although they have been developed commercially only for a limited range of respiratory pathogens. New approaches for respiratory pathogen detection are needed, and breath analysis is an exciting area with enormous potential.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
