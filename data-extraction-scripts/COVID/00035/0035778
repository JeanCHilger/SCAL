In particular, the aluminum salts have achieved an undisputed status as the most commonly used adjuvants in human and veterinary vaccines. Calcium phosphate adjuvant, later discovered by Edgar Relyveld, constitutes a very interesting alternative and has also been applied both in human and veterinary vaccines. New analytical tools applied in adjuvant research are about to take us to the next level of understanding mineral adjuvants. These tools have been used to characterize mineral adjuvants, but so far, in particular, aluminum-based adjuvants in terms of surface marker expression profiles, isotypic profiles, and cytokine profiles. In the past 10years, the discovery of adjuvant-mediated induction of the NALP3 inflammasome and its impact on the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 as proinflammatory mediators in the early phases of immune response has been described as an important mechanism for the function of these adjuvants.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
