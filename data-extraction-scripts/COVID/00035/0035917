Its amino acid sequence shares similarity with those of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22, the cognate ligands for CCR4. The chemotactic effects of CKLF1 for CCR4-transfected cells could be desensitized by TARC/CCL17 and markedly inhibited by PTX. CKLF1 induced a calcium flux in CCR4-transfected cells and fully desensitized a subsequent response to TARC/CCL17, and TARC/CCL17 could partly desensitize the response to CKLF1. CKLF1 caused significant receptor internalization in pCCR4-EGFP transfected cells. Taken together, CKLF1 is a novel functional ligand for CCR4.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
