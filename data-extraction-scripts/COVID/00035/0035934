Serological tests were performed in the blood sera of all animals and in the milk and colostrum sera; hemogram, inhibition of the adhesion to the brush border and histological tests were performed. The calves from vaccinated cows survived the experimental infection after the suction of colostrum in spite of the fact that the calves from control dams died with diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
