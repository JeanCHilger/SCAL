<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Diseases</TITLE><BODY>The major focus of this chapter is the naturally occurring viral diseases of rabbits and hares. The viral diseases of rabbits are discussed in an order based on the taxonomic groups to which the viruses belong and are independent of the order of importance of the various diseases. The material is presented under uniform subject headings, including history, etiology, epidemiology, clinical signs, pathology, diagnosis, and control. Control is interpreted broadly and includes both prevention and eradication. Some viral infections of rabbits have provided fundamental information on basic mechanisms of agentâ€“host interrelationships, e.g., Myxoma virus, and others have been useful as models for human diseases, e.g., Rotavirus. The principal emphasis is on virus infections of domestic rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus. Naturally occurring and experimental infections of other rabbits and hares are also discussed in this chapter. Incoming rabbits are obtained from sources free of infections but appropriate quarantine and screening measures are standard operating procedures. None of the viral infections of rabbits is known to be of public health importance as there are no reports of the definitive spread of viruses from rabbits to humans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
