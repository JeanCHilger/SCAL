Coronavirus envelope spike protein S is a class I viral fusion protein which is characterized by the existence of two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) (forming a complex called fusion core). Here we report that by using in vitro bio-engineering techniques, SARS-CoV HR1 and HR2 bind to each other and form a typical 6-helix bundle. The HR2, either as a synthetic peptide or as a GST-fusion polypeptide, is a potent inhibitor of virus entry. The results do show that SARS-CoV follows the general fusion mechanism of class I viruses and this lays the ground for identification of virus fusion/entry inhibitors for this devastating emerging virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
