The 188-SG strain was characterized by (a) low infectivity, (b) delayed and restricted growth associated with low and delayed RNA synthesis, and (c) a high content of structural antigens. In contrast, Purdue-115 and D-52 strains were characterized by (a) high infectivity, and (b) a normal pattern of virus replication and RNA and structural antigen synthesis. Tunicamycin induced the inhibition of synthesis of El and E2 glycoproteins (detected by the ELISA test using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies) as well as a significant reduction in the NP protein. The inhibitory effect of tunicamycin was influenced by the cell type and virus strain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
