The infection was complicated by severe respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring ventilatory support, including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This was one of the first cases of severe H1N1 disease presenting in the UK. Use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation for the complications of H1N1 resulted in full maternal recovery and subsequent delivery of a healthy infant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
