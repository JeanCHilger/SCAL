All compounds were evaluated for antiviral activity and for cellular toxicity. Interestingly, 2′-deoxy-2′,2′-difluoro-5-iodo- and -5-bromo-uridines showed selective activity against feline herpes virus replication in cell culture due to a specific recognition (activation) by the virus-encoded thymidine kinase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
