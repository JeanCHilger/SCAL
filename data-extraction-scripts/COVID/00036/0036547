<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-03-19</DATELINE><TITLE>La grippe saisonni√®re</TITLE><BODY>Seasonal flu is caused by influenza viruses A and B. These enveloped viruses have a genome made up of seven or eight RNA fragments. The different subtypes are determined by the nature of the two surface glycoproteins HA and NA. Seasonal flu is an epidemic wintertime illness occurring in temperate climate zones. Its epidemiology is linked to the great variability of the virus in time, necessitating an alert system that detects dominating circulating variants each year and that determines the vaccination composition. Clinical flu symptoms are not sufficiently specific to allow for diagnosis with virological tests. This is especially true during non-epidemic periods as well as in subjects older than 65 and younger than five. Children are especially vulnerable to influenza virus infections. Hospitalization occurs more frequently, the younger the child. In children younger than two years, the infection can be pauci-symptomatic and is sometimes detected from non-respiratory symptoms such as lethargy, convulsions, and dizziness. In all cases of respiratory syndrome compatible with influenza virus infection in hospitalized subjects, virological flu diagnosis is of utmost interest. Several tools are available to allow for direct viral detection in respiratory specimens: cell culture isolation, antigenic detection, RNA molecular detection. Choice of method is based on the characteristics of the test: sensibility, specificity, speed and ease of realization, and cost.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
