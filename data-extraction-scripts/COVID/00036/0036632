Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) amplified DNA recovered from both samples. Sequencing of PCR amplificates (V2177/00) obtained with PCV2-specific primer pairs revealed a genome size of 1768 bp. The nucleotide sequence was highly similar (98% nucleotide identity) to the PCV2a reference sequence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
