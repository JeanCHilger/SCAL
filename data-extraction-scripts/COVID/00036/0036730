Here we investigated the antigenic relationship between PEDV and PdCV. We provide the first evidence that conserved epitope(s) on the respective viral nucleocapsid proteins cross-react with each other although virus neutralization cross-reactivity was not observed. As a practical matter, prevention of these two very similar diseases of swine will require the development of separate virus-specific vaccine products.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
