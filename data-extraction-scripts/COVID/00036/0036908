The occurrence and rate of these different disease types is associated with the virus variant used for inoculation. Except for MHV 2, neurovirulence was not observed in four other murine coronavirus strains. The relationship of these coronaviruses to JHM was investigated by cross neutralization and oligonucleotide maps of their genomic RNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
