Their class specificity was assessed by two radioimmunological methods, namely, radioimmunoelectrophoresis and double antibody sandwich radioimmunoassay. The methods are highly specific and sensitive and do not require the use of purified immunoglobulins, but can be performed with normal serum or colostrum. It was confirmed that antibodies found satisfactory in these tests were suitable for a wide range of use including radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
