<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-03-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Antibody induction after combined application of an adjuvanted recombinant FeLV vaccine and a multivalent modified live virus vaccine with a chlamydial component</TITLE><BODY>The compatibility, safety and interaction on antibody induction of a combined vaccine application were assessed. Specific pathogen-free cats were vaccinated with either a modified live virus vaccine containing feline calici- (FCV), herpes- (FHV-1), parvovirus (FPV) and Chlamydophila felis (C. felis), an adjuvanted recombinant feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) vaccine or both vaccines in one syringe. After combined application, FeLV ELISA antibody titres were unaltered, However antibody production based on indirect immunofluorescence assay was remarkably enhanced for FCV and was at selected time points also enhanced for FHV-1 and C. felis but diminished for FPV. The use of these vaccines in combination was safe and will simplify vaccination schedules in veterinary practice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
