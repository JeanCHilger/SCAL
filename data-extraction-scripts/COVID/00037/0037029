A mini-library comprised of synthetic and natural lycorane alkaloids was prepared and their apoptosis-inducing activity investigated in human leukemia (Jurkat) cells. Further insights into the nature of this interesting apoptosis-inducing pharmacophore are described, including the requirement of both free hydroxyl groups in ring-C.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
