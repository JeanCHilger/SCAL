However we currently know little about the virus involvement in human cells, which results poor therapeutic outcome. We propose that these viruses may penetrate into human genome in diseased cells that may finally result resistance to present applicable therapeutic options. Here proposes a strategy – sequence the whole genome (chromosomal as well as other genetic systems) of infected human cells obtained from diseased patients. This might help us to know greatly more about the consequences of virus infection and achieve biotherapy of specifically targeted in future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
