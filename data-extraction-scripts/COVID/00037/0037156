<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>COPD subpopulations and phenotyping</TITLE><BODY>The diagnosis and treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has been largely based on a “one size fits all” approach. Diagnosis of COPD is based on meeting the physiological criteria of fixed obstruction in forced expiratory flows and treatment focus on symptomatic relief with limited effect on the overall prognosis. However, patients with COPD have distinct features that determine very different evolution of the disease. In this review, we highlight distinct subgroups of COPD characterized by unique pathophysiological derangements, response to treatment and disease progression. It is likely that identification of subgroups of COPD will lead to discovery of highly needed disease modifying therapeutic approaches. We argue that a precision approach that integrates multiple dimensions (clinical, physiological, imaging and endotyping) is needed to move the field forward in this disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
