<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-04-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Structural studies on the Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 indicate that matrix proteins of enveloped RNA viruses are analogues but not homologues</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Matrix proteins are the driving force of assembly of enveloped viruses. Their main function is to interact with and polymerize at cellular membranes and link other viral components to the matrixâ€“membrane complex resulting in individual particle shapes and ensuring the integrity of the viral particle. Although matrix proteins of different virus families show functional analogy, they share no sequence or structural homology. Their diversity is also evident in that they use a variety of late domain motifs to commit the cellular vacuolar protein sorting machinery to virus budding. Here, we discuss the structural and functional aspects of the filovirus matrix protein VP40 and compare them to other known matrix protein structures from vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and retroviral matrix proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
