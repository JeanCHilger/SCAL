This study demonstrates that glial cells derived from neural progenitor cells are susceptible to JHMV infection and that treatment of infected cells with IFN-γ inhibits viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Although type I IFN production is muted in JHMV-infected glial cultures, IFN-β is produced following IFN-γ-treatment of JHMV-infected cells. Also, direct treatment of infected glial cultures with recombinant mouse IFN-α or IFN-β inhibits viral replication. IFN-γ-mediated control of JHMV replication is dampened in glial cultures derived from the neural progenitor cells of type I receptor knock-out mice. These data indicate that JHMV is capable of infecting glial cells generated from neural progenitor cells and that IFN-γ-mediated control of viral replication is dependent, in part, on type I IFN secretion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
