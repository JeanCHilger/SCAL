<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>ECMO in tropical diseases</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Diseases prevalent in tropics present with varied manifestations compared to diseases that occur commonly in the temperate climate (the West). Tropical diseases contribute to significant mortality and morbidity. If diagnosed at the right time, tropical diseases have good prognosis too. Utilizing the useful function of supporting the cardio-pulmonary status in these critically ill disease states would be very useful to save thousands of lives each year. As these diseases are not frequent in the West, apart from reporting the experiences in the form of an anecdotal case report, much guidance is not available in their management.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
