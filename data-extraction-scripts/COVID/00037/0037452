We isolate and classify unknown microorganisms and assesse their ability to cause infection, an outbreak, or epidemic. We suggest a list of potential pathogens and propose a preparation, prevention, and control strategy to protect global health and global economy and to ensure global security.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
