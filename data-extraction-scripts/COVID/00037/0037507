This response relies on the recognition of incoming pathogens by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which then trigger various signaling cascades that result in proinflammatory cytokines and interferon production. Tripartite motif (TRIM)â€“containing proteins recently emerged as a large family of RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases with essential regulatory roles during many phases of the antiviral response, either acting as restriction factors or by modulating PRR signaling. In this article, we discuss recent advances in understanding the role of TRIMs in conferring direct antiviral activity as well as in regulating immune signaling pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
