<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2002-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Hospital-acquired viral pathogens in the neonatal intensive care unit</TITLE><BODY>Hospital-acquired infections caused by viruses are a cause of considerable morbidity and occasional mortality in critically ill neonates. The intensive care environment allows for efficient spread of viral pathogens, and secondary cases among both patients and healthcare workers are frequently observed. We review the common viral causes of hospital-acquired infections in neonates, including rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and others, discuss epidemiology and clinical syndromes, and summarize recommendations for control in outbreak situations. Chemoprophylaxis, isolation procedures, and care of affected staff are also addressed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
