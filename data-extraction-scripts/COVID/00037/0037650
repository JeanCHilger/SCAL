Accordingly, dysregulation of the RAS leads to blood pressure elevation with ensuing renal and cardiovascular damage. Recent studies have revealed that the RAS hormonal cascade is more complex than initially posited with multiple enzymes, effector molecules, and receptors that coordinately regulate the effects of the RAS on the kidney and vasculature. Moreover, recently identified tissue-specific RAS components have pleomorphic effects independent of the circulating RAS that influence critical homeostatic mechanisms including the immune response and fetal development. Further characterization of the diverse interactions between the RAS and other signaling pathways within specific tissues should lead to novel treatments for renal and cardiovascular disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
