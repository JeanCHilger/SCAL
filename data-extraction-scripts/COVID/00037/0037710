We confirm that susceptibility to MHV-4 is not linked to the H-2 complex, and that all strains susceptible to acute EAE have both a responder H-2 haplotype (H-2s or H-2d) and induced (B. pertussis) VAAS. In addition, we provide evidence that susceptibility to acute EAE induction is controlled by an additional presently unmapped locus and that an EAE-like histopathological disease does not usually follow MHV-4 infection intracerebrally in animals susceptible to MHV-4, acute EAE and induced VAAS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
