Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference can be performed to estimate the parameters in a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, which is a stochastic model for describing a single outbreak of an infectious disease. The package is thus one step towards statistical software supporting parameter estimation, calculation of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for transmission models.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
