In addition to ML188, ML300 represents the second probe declared for 3CLpro from this collaborative effort. The X-ray structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro bound with a ML300 analog highlights a unique induced-fit reorganization of the S(2)-S(4) binding pockets leading to the first sub-micromolar non-covalent 3CLpro inhibitors retaining a single amide bond.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
