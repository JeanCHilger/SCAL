Common causes include salmonellosis, clostridiosis, Coronavirus, and infection with Neorickettsia risticii (Potomac horse fever). Treatment is empirical and supportive until results of specific diagnostic tests are available. Supportive care is aimed at restoring hydration, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and limiting the systemic inflammatory response. The mainstays of therapy are intravenous fluid therapy, electrolyte supplementation where necessary, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and nutritional support. Specific therapies include colloid oncotic support, antibiotics, hyperimmune plasma, polymyxin B, pentoxifylline, probiotics, binding agents, gastroprotectants, laminitis prevention, and coagulation prophylaxis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
