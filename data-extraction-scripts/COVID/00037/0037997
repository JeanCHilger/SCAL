Central diabetes insipidus was demonstrated by means of a low measured anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) concentration in the face of hypernatraemia, and clinical response to supplementation with desmopressin. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a discrete mass in the region of the hypothalamus. The cat was euthanased and post-mortem histological examination demonstrated B cell lymphoma involving the brain, optic nerves, urinary bladder wall and diaphragm. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this case report is the first to describe central diabetes insipidus caused by central nervous system lymphoma in the cat.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
