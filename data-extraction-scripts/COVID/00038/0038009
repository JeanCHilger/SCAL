Variation of the 3-substituents in a series of bioisosteric and homologated 1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazoles has marked effects on activity with the human adenosine kinase, and analysis of computational descriptors and binding models offers insight for the design of novel substrates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
