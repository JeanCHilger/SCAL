First, the Medical and Casualty Command Post (MedPost) revealed the importance of providing future users with a plausible scenario allowing them to act out their roles. This provided sufficient information on which to base their part of the user interface. We then address two issues that came to the fore in two further projects. PROBE is a CBRNE management system providing support for police, hazardous materials (hazmat) technicians, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) teams, and the commercial eXplosives Identification Tool (XIT) aims to transform disparate, often paper-based, information on commercial explosives and articles into a standardized electronic database. Finally, we summarize the “take-away” messages that we believe may be helpful to HCI practitioners facing similar uncertain, often unpredictable, conditions.
