We detected three PEDV strains from ten small intestine samples from piglets with acute diarrhea and we determined the complete genome sequences of the reemerging Korean PEDV field isolates, except for the noncoding regions from both ends. The complete genome sequences of the strains were identical or almost identical (one synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ORF1a/1b genomic sequence). Interestingly, comparative genome analysis of recent Korean PEDV isolates and other strains revealed that the complete genome sequences of recent Korean strains were almost identical (99.9%) to those of the US PEDV strains isolated in 2013. These results suggest that the three reemerging Korean strains are distinct from previous endemic Korean PEDV strains and has been recently introduced into Korea from oversea with high likelihood.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
