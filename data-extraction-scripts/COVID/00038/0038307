None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. Isoxazolidines having phenyl substituted with halogen (Ar=2-F-C6H4; 3-Br-C6H4; and 4-Br-C6H4) have been found to inhibit proliferation of L1210, CEM as well as HeLa cells with IC50 in the 100–170μM range.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
