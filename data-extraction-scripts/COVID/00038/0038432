In addition, reported cases of the exploration of β-amino-α-trifluoromethyl alcohols for the preparation of trifluoromethylated peptidomimetics and other biologically active, fluorinated compounds are discussed. Attractive opportunities for their applications as organocatalysts are also presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
