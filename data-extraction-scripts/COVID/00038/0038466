Among them, 6,8-difluoro-3-isobutyryl-2-((2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)amino)quinolin-4(1H)-one (6u) exhibits high inhibitory effect (IC50 = 86 nM) and low toxicity (CC50 > 25 Î¼M). Moreover, it shows good metabolic stability, low hERG binding affinity, no cytotoxicity, and good in vivo PK properties.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
