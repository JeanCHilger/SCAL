Environmental investigations i.e. samples from the hospital water system did not reveal any Legionella. The patient may have been exposed to waterborne pathogens despite terminal water filtration due to a technical device to release residual tap water from the hose after showering. A sodium chloride nose spray was found to be contaminated with the A. fumigatus isolate of the patient.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
