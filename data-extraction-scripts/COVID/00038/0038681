<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Donkey Internal Medicineâ€”Part I: Metabolic, Endocrine, and Alimentary Tract Disturbances</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Metabolic and endocrine disturbances are common in donkeys. This species has an inherent ability to thrive with limited and poor-quality roughage. Donkeys are extremely efficient in energy storage and mobilization, which predisposes to hyperlipemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of dyslipidemias is higher in donkeys than other equids, which is more evident under stressful conditions. Diagnosis of endocrine and metabolic disorders in donkeys should be based on species-specific information considering that differences in a multitude of variables compared with horses have been demonstrated. Protocols to assess endocrine disorders (e.g., pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, and thyroid illness) are unavailable, and extrapolation from horse data can be misleading. Treatment guidelines for these conditions in donkeys are currently not reported. On the other hand, the typical stoic and hardy behavior of donkeys can hinder prompt diagnosis of gastrointestinal problems, specifically colic, which is commonly caused by dental issues in this species. Moreover, subclinical gastric ulcer syndrome appears to be a common pathology in this species, especially in working donkeys.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
