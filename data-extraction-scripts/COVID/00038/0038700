Titres above 1:64 were considered positive. IgG antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 10 serum samples from group 1 and in 10 serum samples from group 2, and in 2 aqueous humor samples from group 1 and in 1 aqueous humor samples from group 2. The distribution of ocular lesions according to the serological status of the animals indicated that lens luxation and buphthalmia were more frequent in T. gondii seropositive cats than in seronegative ones. The study reports a similar prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in cats with uveitis and in cats without uveitis in France. Serological results must be analysed carefully and additional diagnostic tools is required.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
