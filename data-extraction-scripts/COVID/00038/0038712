All synthesized catechols were evaluated against a large panel of DNA and RNA viruses, including Poliovirus type 1, Echovirus type 9, Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Coxsackievirus type B3 (Cox B3), Adenovirus type 2 and type 5 and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). A significant antiviral activity was observed in the inhibition of HSV-1, HSV-2, Cox B3 and CMV. The mechanism of action of the most active dihydrocaffeoyl derivative was investigated against a model of HSV-1 infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
