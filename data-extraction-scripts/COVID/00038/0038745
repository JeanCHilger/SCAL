In addition, an antiviral effect of rPoIFNγ was demonstrable against the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection of porcine epithelial cells and of pulmonary macrophages. A rabbit anti-PoIFNγ antiserum was prepared and shown to specifically neutralize the antiviral effects of natural and recombinant porcine IFNγ preparations. This antiserum could also neutralize recombinant bovine IFNγ but not recombinant human IFNγ. These results suggest antigenic homology of porcine and bovine IFNγ but antigenic differences between these molecules and human IFNγ.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
