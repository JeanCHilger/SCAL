<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Clinical Biochemistry and Hematology</TITLE><BODY>This chapter discusses the clinical biochemistry and hematology of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and other rodents, including the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger), degu (Octodon degus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), dormouse (Gliridae family), kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spp.), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), and sand rat (Psammomys obesus). The chapter begins with a review of sample collection and preparation, and a description of commonly measured parameters and analytical techniques. The reference values, sources of variation, and unique characteristics are then presented for each species, as available. Many variables affect the parameters of clinical biochemistry and hematology including methods of sample collection and preparation, equipment, reagents, and methods of analysis, as well as the age, sex, breed, and environment of the animals being sampled. Values obtained from a clinical case are usually compared with reference values that are either produced in the same laboratory or in a similar group of animals, or cited in the literature. Optimal sites for blood collection vary between laboratory animals and are described in this chapter for each species for which information is available. Total blood volume of the rabbit is discussed in the Hematology section of the chapter. The rabbit is recognized as a valuable model for human disturbances in lipid metabolism, such as the metabolic syndrome and hypercholesterolemia leading to atherosclerosis. Hematology is the study of blood and blood-forming organs, including the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the blood, bone marrow, and immunologic, hemostatic, and vascular systems. Hematologic analysis is often used for the diagnosis and treatment of animal diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
