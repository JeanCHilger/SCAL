The soluble form of DPP4 (sDPP4) circulates systematically and can competitively inhibit MERS-CoV entry into host cells. Here, we measured the concentration of sDPP4 in the plasma and sputa of 14 MERS-CoV-infected patients of various degrees of disease severity. The concentration of sDPP4 in the plasma of MERS patients (474.76 ± 108.06 ng/ml) was significantly lower than those of healthy controls (703.42 ± 169.96 ng/ml), but there were no significant differences among the patient groups. Interestingly, plasma levels of IL-10 and EGF were negatively and positively correlated with sDPP4 concentrations, respectively. The sDPP4 levels in sputa were less than 300 ng/ml. Viral infection was inhibited by 50% in the presence of more than 8000 ng/ml of sDPP4. Therefore, sDPP4 levels in the plasma of MERS patients are significantly reduced below the threshold needed to exert an antiviral effect against MERS-CoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
