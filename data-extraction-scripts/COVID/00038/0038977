The lead compounds, functionalized serine derivatives, were designed based on the tetrapeptide aldehyde and Baiâ€™s cinnamoly inhibitor, and additionally performed with simulation on GOLD softwear. Structure activity relationship studies of the candidate compounds were given reasonable inhibitors ent-3 and ent-7k against SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease. These inhibitors showed protease selectivity and no cytotoxicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
