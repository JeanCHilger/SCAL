Some glycosylated flavonols showed very interesting biological activities. A library of flavonols has been made through Algar–Flynn–Oyamada reaction from 2′-hydroxyacetophenones and benzaldehydes. Glycosylation of these flavonols with various glycosyl donors affords a library of glycosylated flavonols. These compounds are potentially useful pharmacologically active compounds and will be studied for biological activities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
