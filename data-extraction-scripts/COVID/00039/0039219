<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-09-08</DATELINE><TITLE>2,6-Bis-arylmethyloxy-5-hydroxychromones with antiviral activity against both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and SARS-associated coronavirus (SCV)</TITLE><BODY>In this study, as a bioisosteric alternative scaffold of the antiviral aryl diketoacids (ADKs), we used 5-hydroxychromone on which two arylmethyloxy substituents were installed. The 5-hydroxychromones (5b–5g) thus prepared showed anti-HCV activity and, depending on the aromatic substituents on the 2-arylmethyloxy moiety, some of the derivatives (5b–5f) were also active against SCV. In addition, unlike the ADKs which showed selective inhibition against the helicase activity of the SCV NTPase/helicase, the 5-hydroxychromones (5b–5f) were active against both NTPase and helicase activities of the target enzyme. Among those, 3-iodobenzyloxy-substituted derivative 5e showed the most potent activity against HCV (EC(50) = 4 μM) as well as SCV (IC(50) = 4 μM for ATPase activity, 11 μM for helicase activity) and this might be used as a platform structure for future development of the multi-target or broad-spectrum antivirals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
