<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Treatment of Calf Diarrhea: Intravenous Fluid Therapy</TITLE><BODY>Severely dehydrated calves that are unable to suckle need intravenous fluids for effective resuscitation. Intravenous fluid therapy is also indicated for sick calves without obvious dehydration, such as calves with strong ion acidosis, ruminal acidosis (rumen drinkers), severe pneumonia, septicemia, or hypothermia. This article presents an updated overview of intravenous fluid therapy for calves, recent insights into the development of metabolic acidosis in young calves resulting from accumulation of D-lactate, a simplified algorithm for intravenous fluid therapy, and a procedure for ear vein catheterization under field conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
