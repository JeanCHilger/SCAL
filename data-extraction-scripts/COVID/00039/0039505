This resistance arises due to a histidine to tyrosine substitution in the neuraminidase active site (H275Y in N1 nomenclature). Current methods to detect this mutation involve an end-point reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by nucleotide sequencing. While accurate, this approach has the limitation of being time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. Herein we describe a one-step allelic discrimination assay which rapidly (2h) detects this resistance mutation. The sensitivity of the assay was as low as 10 copies per reaction and is capable of detecting the antiviral resistance mutation in a mixture of wild type H275 and mutant H275Y targets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
