Unequivocal proofs for the stereostructure of some new arabinosyl pyrimidinone derivatives were obtained by X-ray structure analysis. These newly synthesized compounds were then evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia (L1210), and human T-lymphocytes (Molt 4/C8 and CEM). Of all the compounds in the series, the protected silylated tricyclic fused pyrimidinone 10 showed the most significant antitumor activity against murine leukemia L1210 (IC(50) = 6 μM), and human T-lymphocytes cells Molt 4/C8 (IC(50) = 7.9 μM) and CEM/0 cell lines (IC(50) = 7.5 μM). None of the compounds exhibited significant antiviral inhibitory activities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
