The impacts of the pattern on epidemic dynamics in heterogeneous metapopulation networks, wherein each node represents a subpopulation with any number of individuals, are investigated by using a mean-field approach. The results show that the pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, but can slightly lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole. More importantly, we also find that the pattern produces different impacts on nodes with different degree, and that there exists a critical degree [Formula: see text]. For nodes with degree smaller than [Formula: see text] , the pattern produces a positive impact on epidemic mitigation; conversely, for nodes with degree larger than [Formula: see text] , the pattern produces a negative impact on epidemic mitigation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
