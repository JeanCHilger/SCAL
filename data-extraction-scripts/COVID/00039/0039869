<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-16</DATELINE><TITLE>The Chinese or Striped-Back Hamster</TITLE><BODY>Chinese hamsters are small rodents with a grayish black coat and a black dorsal stripe. Adult animals weigh approximately 39â€“46 gm, and measure approximately 9 cm in length. This species has been shown to be susceptible to a number of experimentally induced viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. In recent years, the Chinese hamster's contributions as a laboratory animal have been largely overshadowed by the focus on its cell lines and the role it plays in scientific research and biotechnology. The Chinese hamster used in biomedical research is traditionally classified as Cricetulus griseus. It has several biological features that have helped promote its use in biomedical research and these attributes include its small size, polyestrous cycle, short gestation period, and low chromosome number. The Chinese hamster has a low incidence of spontaneous and endogenous viral infections. This species has been shown to be susceptible to a number of experimentally induced viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Chinese hamster-derived cells have played a major role in cytogenetic toxicity assays and the production of glycosylated therapeutic proteins. The behavior, research uses, and general toxicology of the Chinese hamster are summarized in this chapter.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
