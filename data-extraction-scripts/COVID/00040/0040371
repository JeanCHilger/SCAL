Nitrile oxides were generated in situ from oximes using a commercial bleaching agent; their cycloaddition with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine yielded isoxazoles possessing activity against herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, Encephalomyocarditis virus, Coxsackie B3, and vesicular stomatitis virus; these isoxazoles were, however, inactive against corona virus, influenza virus, and HIV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
