Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China and has spread to become a global pandemic, with, as of Feb 26, 2020, community transmission in Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Modelling studies have aided understanding of COVID-19 dynamics from the first announcement of the epidemic and publication of the genetic sequence of the causative virus. Initial phylogenetic analysis of closely related viruses suggested highly linked person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 originating from mid-November to early December, 2019.1, 2 Following this, modellers provided simple calculations that identified a mismatch between reported cases in China and reported importations of cases from travellers. Based on travel volumes, modellers inferred3 that cases in Wuhan were underestimated by a factor of 40—a crucially important finding. Further calculations, again based on travel volumes, suggested that some countries would be expected to have many more travel-related cases than had been notified,4 drawing attention to the possibility of undetected cases and community transmission in several countries. • View related content for this article Transmission dynamic models are a necessary first step in understanding the pandemic potential of an emerging infectious disease, including estimating the reproduction number—the number of new cases arising from a typical infected case. The first published transmission dynamic study of COVID-19 was rapid and uncomplicated, estimating the basic reproduction number as time-invariant5 without exploring some of the major underlying assumptions, such as lack of infectiousness during the incubation period. Since this early publication, many estimates for the reproduction rate have appeared, ranging from around 2 to more than 6.6&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
