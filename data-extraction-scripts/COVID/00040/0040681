This PCR diagnostic method allowed identification of C. anatis from house flies, Musca domestica L., turkey gut, and fecal samples within 6h after field-collected samples reached the laboratory. House flies detected carrying C. anatis using the diagnostic 374bp amplicons represented the first record of this protozoan in house flies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
