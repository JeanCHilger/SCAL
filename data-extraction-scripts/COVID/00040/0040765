Since plasma is predisposed to contamination by a variety of blood-borne pathogens, ascertaining and ensuring the pathogen safety of plasma-derived therapeutics is a priority among manufacturers. State-of-the-art manufacturing processes provide a high safety standard by incorporating virus elimination procedures into the manufacturing process. Based on their mechanism these procedures are grouped into three classes: partitioning, inactivation, and virusfiltration.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
