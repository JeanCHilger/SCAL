Altering the frameshifting efficiencies disrupts the virus life cycle and eliminates or reduces virus production. Ribosomal frameshifting therefore provides a unique target on which antiviral agents can function. This article describes a series of rapid assay strategies that have been developed and used to identify potential antiviral agents that target programmed âˆ’1 ribosomal frameshifting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
