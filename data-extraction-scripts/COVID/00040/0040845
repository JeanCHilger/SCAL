The presence of M antigen of TGEV on the surface of infected cells was demonstrated by this technique. This finding is in contrast to the M protein of murine hepatitis coronavirus which migrates to the Golgi apparatus but is not transported to the plasma membrane. The time course of appearance M and S antigens on the surface of TGEV-infected cell can be studied by this technique.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
