Global eradication of rinderpest needs a robust, safe and cost-effective vaccine. The causative agent, rinderpest virus (RPV) is an important member of the genus Morbillivirus in the Paramyxoviridae family. We have generated transgenic peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) plants expressing hemagglutinin protein of RPV and report here, the induction of immune responses in cattle following oral feeding with transgenic leaves expressing hemagglutinin protein without oral adjuvant. Hemagglutinin-specific antibody was detected in the serum as confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of virus-infected cells, and in vitro neutralization of virus infectivity. Oral delivery also resulted in cell-mediated immune responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
