Clinically, specific drugs to treat FCV have not yet been developed. Here, IgG was extracted from inactivated FCV-immunized horse sera. Equine F(ab')2 fragments were obtained from pepsin-digested IgG and then purified by protein-G column chromatography. In our study, equine immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments showed efficient neutralizing activity in vitro against FCV and had therapeutic and prophylactic effects in FCV-infected cats. The anti-FCV-specific F(ab')2 fragment can significantly alleviate the clinical symptoms of FCV-infected cats and reduce the viral loads of the trachea, lung and spleen. These results indicate that the F(ab')2 fragment prepared from inactivated FCV-immunized horses may be used as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for diseases caused by FCV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
