Many viruses employ different mechanism to produce ncRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces a novel ncRNA in virus-infected cells. This ncRNA consists of 563 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail, is mainly derived from the 3′-untranslated region of IBV genome, and contains a 63-nt-long of terminal leader sequence derived from the 5′ end of the viral genome. Using mutagenesis and reverse genetics, we reveal that this ncRNA is a subgenomic RNA generated by discontinuous transcription mechanism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
