<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1987-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Rapid detection of viral-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The development of three separate rapid ELISAs for detecting antibodies in host serum to three different viruses is described. These include: 1. 1.|A direct antigen assay using enzyme labelled anti-canine Ig for detecting antibodies to canine parvovirus, 2. 2.|A competitive ELISA using a feline infectious peritonitis virus-specific monoclonal antibody labelled with enzyme, and 3. 3.|A competitive ELISA using an equine infectious anemia virus-specific monoclonal antibody and enzyme labelled antigen, p. 26. The utility and benefits of each of the three approaches is emphasized.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
