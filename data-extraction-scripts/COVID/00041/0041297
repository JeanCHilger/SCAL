It grows within a wide temperature range (15–33°C), survives between 7 and 10°C for several months without alterations in its further virus susceptibility and growth characteristics, and degenerates at 37°C. Its karyotype is 2n=96. It propagates most of the systemic infection viruses of the fish families Salmonidae, Cyprinidae, Anguillidae and Esocidae, as well as Indiana-type vesicular stomatitis virus. Despite the origin of EPC cells, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of herpes virus in them. Their transformation was reflected in their karyotype (normally 2n=100) and by their growth ability in soft agar medium; monolayer growth, however, was inhibited at a density of 3×106 cells/cm2. The temperature growth range, good splitting ratio (1/10) and virus susceptibility make EPC cells a highly suitable material both for fish pathology and for comparative virology studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
