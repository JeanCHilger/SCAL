The synthetic steroids were completely characterized by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR and FABMS spectra. Sulfation was performed using triethylamine–sulfur trioxide complex in dimethylformamide as the sulfating agent. The sulfated steroids were comparatively evaluated for their inhibitory effect on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Compounds 7 and 8 were the most effective in their inhibitory action against HSV-2. The disulfated steroid 8 also proved to be active against DEN-2 and JV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
