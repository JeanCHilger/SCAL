A kinetic enzymatic resolution generated an enantiopure aminocyclopentenol and Pd(0)-mediated decarboxylative allylations of allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonates were used to install the 4′-hydroxyethyl groups. Late stage derivatization gave access to the cyclopropylamine congenors, (−)-5′-homoabacavir and (+)-epi-4′-homoabacavir. All carbonucleoside target molecules were evaluated for antiviral activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
