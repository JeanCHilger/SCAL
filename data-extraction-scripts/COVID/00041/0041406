<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-05-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Milk</TITLE><BODY>Motherâ€™s milk delivered naturally through breast-feeding has been the sole source of infant nutrition in mammalian species for millions of years. Since human beings learned to domesticate cattle about 10,000 years ago, nonhuman mammalian milk also has been used to supplement or replace maternal milk in the human infant. The development and widespread use of commercially prepared infant formula products have been phenomena of the 20th century and notably of the past 6 decades. Additional information acquired during the last several years has reinforced existing concepts on the role of breast-feeding in protecting the infant against infections, in providing an ideal source of infant nutrition, in modulating infectious immune responses, and in suppressing the evolution of neoplasms and autoimmune disease later in life. 1 Over the past few decades, the immune responses on intestinal and respiratory mucosal surfaces to local infections have been intensely studied. These investigations have led to the development of concepts of immunity on mucosal surfaces of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and identification of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and local mechanisms of defense that are distinct from the internal (systemic) immune system. This chapter reviews existing information on major aspects of the physiologic, nutritional, immunologic, and anti-infective components of the products of lactation. Also discussed is the most recent evidence on the contribution of human milk to the development of immunologic integrity in the infant and its influence on the outcome of infections and other host-antigen interactions in the neonate.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
