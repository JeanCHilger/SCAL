(NTEC in farm animals).</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of the virulence factors and their genetic regulators in Escherichia coli. The most important adhesins and their receptors playing a role in the pathogenesis of different pathotypes of enteric E. coli are also described. The main pathotypes involved in enteric colibacillosis of pigs and calves are the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and necrotoxigenic E. coli (NTEC). Adhesion and colonization are the first (but not the only) functional prerequisites for a mucosal bacterium to be pathogenic. The adhesins represent surface proteins, governed by specific operons and constructed in ways according to the particular adhesin. Besides their structure, the adhesins can also be grouped according to their receptors present on the intestinal mucosal epithelium and on the urinary epithelium. Apart from direct practical applications, there are further significant scientific developments and applications expected in the area of neonatal biology and comparative human pathobacteriology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
