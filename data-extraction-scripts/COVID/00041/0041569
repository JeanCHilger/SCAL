As some of the basics of fusion become clear, a myriad of compelling questions come to the fore. Is the interior of the fusion pore protein or lipid? Why is synaptic release so fast? Why is PIP(2) needed for exocytosis? How does fusion peptide insertion lead to fusion of viruses to cell membranes? What role does the TMD play? How can studies on membrane fission contribute to our understanding of membrane fusion? What exactly are SNARE proteins doing?&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
