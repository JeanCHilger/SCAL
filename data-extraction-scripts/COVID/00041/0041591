This variability of virus pathogenesis is not well understood. Here we revise theoretical arguments to further our understanding of factors controlling infection and its severity. We propose that variability in these factors results in different clinical outcomes, which ultimately ensure virus reproduction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
