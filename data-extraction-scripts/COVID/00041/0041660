<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-01-05</DATELINE><TITLE>The interferon response circuit: Induction and suppression by pathogenic viruses</TITLE><BODY>Type I interferons (IFN-α/β) are potent antiviral cytokines and modulators of the adaptive immune system. They are induced by viral infection or by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a by-product of viral replication, and lead to the production of a broad range of antiviral proteins and immunoactive cytokines. Viruses, in turn, have evolved multiple strategies to counter the IFN system which would otherwise stop virus growth early in infection. Here we discuss the current view on the balancing act between virus-induced IFN responses and the viral counterplayers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
