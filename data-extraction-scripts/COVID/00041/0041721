To detect the geographic origin and timing of USA porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) isolates, we conducted a retrospective study to isolate 19 PEDV strains from positive samples obtained prior to April 2013. The results of phylogenetic and recombination analyses showed that GDS10 strain shared a common ancestor with CO13 strain, which was obtained from a piglet with severe diarrhea in USA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
