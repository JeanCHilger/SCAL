Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) uses this strategy to express its replicase component protein p88. In this study, we used a cell-free translation system to map cis-acting RNA elements required for − 1 PRF. Our results show that a small stem-loop structure adjacent to the cap-independent translation element in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of RCNMV RNA1 is required for − 1 PRF. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested that this stem-loop regulates − 1 PRF via base-pairing with complementary sequences in a bulged stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site. The existence of RNA elements responsible for − 1 PRF and the cap-independent translation of replicase proteins in the 3′ UTR of RNA1 might be important for switching translation to replication and for regulating the ratio of p88 to p27.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
