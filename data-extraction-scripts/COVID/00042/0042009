Antiserum raised against this fusion protein specifically immunoprecipitates a 30K protein from infected 17CI-1 mouse fibroblasts. The protein is localized primarily in the cytosol and not in the membranes. This is consistent with its predicted sequence and potential role as an RNA binding protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
