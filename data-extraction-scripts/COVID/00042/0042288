<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Hospital-acquired human bocavirus in infants</TITLE><BODY>Summary Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a respiratory pathogen that affects young children. We screened 511 nasopharyngeal aspirates for hospital-acquired HBoV from infants hospitalised with respiratory infection from January to December 2008. Among 55 children with HBoV infection, 10 cases were hospital-acquired. Compared with the community-acquired cases, coinfection with other respiratory viruses in these patients was uncommon. HBoV should be considered for inclusion in screening protocols for nosocomial childhood respiratory infections, especially in intensive care units.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
