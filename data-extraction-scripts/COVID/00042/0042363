Currently, there are no approved treatment regimens or vaccines for MERS. Here, we generated recombinant nonvirulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota strain expressing MERS-CoV S protein (designated as rLa-MERS-S), and evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and Bactrian camels. The results revealed that rLa-MERS-S showed similar growth properties to those of LaSota in embryonated chicken eggs, while animal immunization studies showed that rLa-MERS-S induced MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice and camels. Our findings suggest that recombinant rLa-MERS-S may be a potential MERS-CoV veterinary vaccine candidate for camels and other animals affected by MERS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
