<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-16</DATELINE><TITLE>The Experimental Use of Syrian Hamsters</TITLE><BODY>The Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is a widely used experimental animal model. This chapter focuses primarily on the most current research uses of the hamster. More classical uses are covered only as they pertain to these current uses. Hamsters possess unique anatomical and physiological features, which make them desirable research models. Unlike other commonly used laboratory rodents, hamsters possess a cheek pouch, which can be easily everted and examined at both the gross and microscopic level. The hamster's relative size also allows for better visualization of certain biological systems including the respiratory and reproductive systems when compared to the mouse. Further, laboratory hamsters develop a variety of inherited diseases, which display similarities to human conditions. Hamsters possessing some of these inherited traits are commercially available. They are susceptible to a variety of carcinogens and develop tumors that other research animals less commonly develop. Also they are susceptible to the induction of a variety of metabolic disorders through the use of dietary manipulations. The antagonistic nature of hamsters is used to study the effect of treatment on male aggressive and defensive behaviors. Syrian hamsters display several unique characteristics that make them desired models for carcinogenesis studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
