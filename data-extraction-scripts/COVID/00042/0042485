However due to the lack of a stabilising group at its 2-position, it is difficult to synthesize stable prodrugs of this compound. In order to overcome this lack of stability, the synthesis of carbasugar analogues of 2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate was envisioned. Herein the preparation of a series of prodrugs of two carbocyclic analogues of 2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate using the phosphoramidate ProTide technology, along with their biological evaluation against HIV and cancer cell proliferation, is reported.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
