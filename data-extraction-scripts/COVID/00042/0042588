A number of reports have demonstrated that CyPA plays a critical role in the successful replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), etc. However, recent studies demonstrated that CyPA also possesses a repressive effect on the replication of some viruses like Influenza A virus and rotavirus. Moreover, CyPA could also regulate host IFN-I response to viral infections. Together, these evidences showed diverse roles of CyPA in viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
