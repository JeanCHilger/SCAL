It allows rapid and simultaneous detection of thousands of parameters within a single experiment. Recent developments in the field of carbohydrate microarray technology facilitate applications for different types of proteinâ€“carbohydrate interactions. These developments included capture molecule immobilization, surface engineering and detection strategies to analyze entire glycomes and glycosylation in vertebrate systems, the most common post-translational modification.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
