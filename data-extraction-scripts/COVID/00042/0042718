The gene encodes a protein of 1447 amino acids with a molecular weight of 159 574. Comparison with the primary structure of the peplomer protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (de Groot et al., 1987b) revealed one domain, from amino acids 1 to 274, in which the nucleotide homology was 39%, whereas in the second domain (from residues 275 to 1447) the homology was 93%.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
