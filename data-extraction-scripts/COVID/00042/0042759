A strain of Belgian Landrace sows was selected for this study because they produced pigs which had no myfibrillar hypoplasia. Myofibrillar hypoplasia could nevertheless by induced experimentally in these animals by dexamethasone treatment of the sows during late pregnancy. The lesion was observed without clinical signs and was compared to the myofibrillar hypoplasia in clinical cases of splayleg. The differences between these 2 groups may account for the appearance of clinical signs. These differences included the maturity of the myofibrils and the degree of autophagosomal glycogen breakdown.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
