<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanosensor networks for health-care applications</TITLE><BODY>Functionalized transistors provide effective sensors for a variety of viruses (Zika, severe acute respiratory syndrome), toxins (botulinum), cancers (breast and prostate), and disease or injury biomarkers (troponin, cerebrospinal fluid). A hallmark of this approach is high specificity, rapid response (<5 minutes), and ability to be integrated with wireless data transmission capabilities. The ultimate goal is hand-held point-of-care detection that can streamline patient diagnosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
