<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Initial Performance Evaluation of a Spotted Array Mobile Analysis Platform (MAP) for the Detection of Influenza A/B, RSV and MERS Coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>Clinical samples were evaluated with the Mobile Analysis Platform (MAP) to determine platform performance for detecting respiratory viruses in samples previously characterized using clinical RT-PCR assays. The percent agreement between MAP and clinical results was 97% for influenza A (73/75), 100% (21/21) for influenza B, 100% (6/6) for RSV, and 80% (4/5) for negative specimens. The approximate LOD of the MAP was 30 copies/assay for RSV and 1500 copies/assay for MERS Coronavirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
