(2019) present angiotensin receptor AT2R structure in complex with its main endogenous agonist, AngII peptide. Complementing the previous structural studies, the new complex structure sheds light on the AT2R activation mechanism and opens new avenues for drug discovery targeting this enigmatic receptor.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
