Dendritic cell subpopulations express specific nucleic acid recognition receptors belonging to the Toll-like receptor family (TLR3, 7, 8, 9) and the cytosolic RNA helicase family (RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2). Activation of dendritic cells by viral DNA and RNA via these receptors is essential for triggering the innate antiviral immune response and shaping the ensuing adaptive antiviral immunity. This review will summarize our current knowledge of viral nucleic acid recognition and signaling by Toll-like receptors and RNA helicases focusing on recent evidence for their specific functions in antiviral defense in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
