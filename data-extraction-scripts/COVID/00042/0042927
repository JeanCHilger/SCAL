<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Myeloma-related disorder with leukaemic progression in a cat</TITLE><BODY>A 10-year-old American Shorthair cat with nasal discharge, anorexia, and weight loss was found to have pancytopenia and hyperproteinaemia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed atypical plasma cells that totalled 50% of the nucleated bone marrow cells. The number of atypical plasma cells progressively increased in the peripheral blood during the observation period of 64 days. The cat did not respond to treatments with melphalan, chlorambucil, and prednisolone, and died 71 days after the initial presentation. Clinical, cytological, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings in this case supported the diagnosis of myeloma-related disorder (MRD) with leukaemic progression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
