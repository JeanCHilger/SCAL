<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-04-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Comparative Modeling of Drug Target Proteins</TITLE><BODY>In this perspective, we begin by describing the comparative protein structure modeling technique and the accuracy of the corresponding models. We then discuss the significant role that comparative prediction plays in drug discovery. We focus on virtual ligand screening against comparative models and illustrate the state of the art by a number of specific examples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
