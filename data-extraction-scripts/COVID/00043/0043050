DESIGN AND METHODS: Tim-3 expression on peripheral immunocytes from ICH patients and healthy volunteers was measured by flow cytometry. The correlation between Tim-3 expression and the clinical indices was estimated using linear regression. RESULTS: Tim-3 expressions on peripheral CD3(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in ICH patients are significantly downregulated, while Tim-3 expressions on CD14(+) monocytes and CD16(+)CD56(+) NK cells are increased. Furthermore, Tim-3 expression on peripheral CD8(+) T cells was negatively correlated with the inflammatory response, the disease severity and the outcome of ICH patients. However, there was no relationship between Tim-3 expression and blood glucose concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Altered expression of Tim-3 might play an important role in the pathogenesis of ICH, demonstrating that Tim-3 might be a novel candidate molecule for prognosis evaluation of ICH patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
