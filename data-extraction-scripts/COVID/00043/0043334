The amplification could be finished in 45min under isothermal condition at 62Â°C by employing a set of four primers targeting VP2 gene of PPV. LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity than PCR, with a detection limit of 5 copies of PPV genomic DNA per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses including canine parvovirus, parvovirus B19, porcine circovirus type 1, porcine circovirus type 2 and porcine peudorabies virus. The detection rate of PPV LAMP for 125 clinical samples was 97.6% and appeared higher than that of PCR method. The result indicated the potential usefulness of the technique as a simple, rapid procedure for the detection of PPV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
