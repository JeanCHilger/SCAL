PEDV pathogenesis is strain-specific, and studies in neonatal pigs have demonstrated that the PEDV non-S-INDEL strains are more pathogenic than the PEDV S-INDEL strains. RNA viruses, including PEDV, can interact with a large number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the intestinal mucosa, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). We investigated the differential gene modulation of TLRs, RIG-I, and downstream mediators on the intestinal mucosa of neonatal pigs infected with PEDV S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL strains. Ten five-day-old piglets were inoculated orally with 10 ml of 10(4) TCDI(50)/ml of either PEDV non-S-INDEL or S-INDEL strains. PEDV S-INDEL infection induced pro-inflammatory cytokines through the non-canonical NF-ÎºB signaling pathway by activating RIG-I. In contrast, PEDV non-S-INDEL infection suppressed the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production by down-regulation of TLRs and downstream signaling molecules.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
