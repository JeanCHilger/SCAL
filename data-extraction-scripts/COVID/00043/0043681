<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-09</DATELINE><TITLE>COVID-19 and gender-specific difference: Analysis of public surveillance data in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, from January 10 to February 15, 2020</TITLE><BODY>To the Editor. An outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), started in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019 [1], has now reached 40 countries and poses huge threat to global public health and economic [2]. Given the risk of human-to-human transmission, the serial interval (SI), which refers to the time interval from symptom onset of a primary case (i.e., infector) to that of a secondary case (i.e., infectee) [3], is the other essential quantity besides the basic reproduction number to drive the spreading speed. We examine the publicly available materials and collect the records of COVID-19 transmission events in two neighboring large cities, Hong Kong [4] and Shenzhen [5], in south China from January 10 to February 15, 2020 and extract the SI data. We identify 48 transmission events including 21 in Hong Kong and 27 in Shenzhen, among which 40 events contain the gender information of the primary cases. The last onset date of the primary cases among all collected transmission events is February 2, 2020.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
