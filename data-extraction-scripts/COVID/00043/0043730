Herein the mRT-PCR was compared to the commercial Luminex mPCR-microsphere flow cytometry assay (Resplex II) which allows the detection of 12 different viruses. Eleven different viruses were identified in 91 nasopharyngeal swabs of children with acute respiratory infection, influenza A (IAV) and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRhV), human echovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronavirus NL63. The results of the two techniques showed 53 and 40 positive patients by the Resplex II assay and mRT-PCR, respectively, with a concordance in 35 positive and 33 negative patients (74.7%). Individual RT-PCR tests were performed to control viruses not simultaneously detected by the two multiplex assays. The major virus misdiagnosed by mRT-PCR was IAV whereas the major viruses misdiagnosed by Resplex II were PIV1, 3 and 4. The mRT-PCR remains a simple, rapid, and specific assay for the specific detection of respiratory viruses, and can be easily implemented with standards in clinical laboratories at a low cost.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
