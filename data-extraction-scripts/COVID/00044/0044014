Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants. METHODS: We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness. RESULTS: This case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ damage and rapid disease changes. CONCLUSIONS: When managing such infant patients with COVID-19, frequent and careful clinical monitoring is essential.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
