Derm) cells. EHV-1 colocalized with caveolin in EBMECs and the infection was greatly reduced by the expression of a dominant negative form of equine caveolin-1 (ecavY14F), suggesting that EHV-1 enters EBMECs via caveolar endocytosis. EHV-1 entry into E. Derm cells was significantly reduced by ATP depletion and treatments with lysosomotropic agents. Enveloped virions were detected from E. Derm cells by infectious virus recovery assay after viral internalization, suggesting that EHV-1 enters E. Derm cells via energy- and pH-dependent endocytosis. These results suggest that EHV-1 utilizes multiple endocytic pathways in different cell types to establish productive infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
