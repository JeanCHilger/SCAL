The animals suffered from respiratory and nephropathogenic disease. Gross lesions observed during necropsy included tracheitis, aerosacculitis, and nephritis. Tracheal swabs were tested positive for infectious bronchitis virus Middle-East GI-23 lineage (Var2-like) by PCR. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the S1 spike protein showed close relationship to the commercially available vaccine TAbic IBVAR206 and polish isolates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
