The methodology relies on the highly regioselective formation of the ortho-pyridinone methide from pyridoxine and subsequent oxa-Michael addition of alcohol nucleophiles. This methodology provides good to excellent yields for primary and secondary alcohols and moderate yields for tertiary alcohols.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
