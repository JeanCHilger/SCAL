<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Phlorotannins</TITLE><BODY>Natural marine-derived compounds show excellent biological activities. Isolation, characterization and applications of marine derived compounds show a promising way to develop novel drugs to treat various diseases. Phlorotannins are one of the main compounds which are commonly isolated from the brown seaweeds. The structural unit of phlorotannins is made-up of polyphenolic units. Due to the unique structures, phlorotannins show a variety of biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antitumor, antidiabetics, radio protective, antiadipogenic, and anti-allergic effects. In the current chapter, we have discussed general information on phlorotannins, extraction procedure and their biological activities in detail. From the scientific literature, phlorotannins can be potentially useful in the development of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
