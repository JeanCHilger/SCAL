Nosocomial infections are particularly common in premature infants who combine many risk factors : immature immune system, low level of antibodies against several pathogens, parenteral nutrition through central catheter, exposure to close and frequent contacts with multiple stakeholders. Clinical signs of infections are non-specific. Diagnosis lies on increase blood inflammatory parameters and, mainly, blood cultures. Coagulase negative Staphylococci are the predominant pathogen. The rapid evolution of some of these infections and the risk of secondary locations lead to the prescription of a broad-spectrum first-line antibiotic treatment that should be re-evaluated and adjusted secondarily. Inflammatory response induced by nosocomial infections increases the risk of neurological sequellae in premature newborn.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
