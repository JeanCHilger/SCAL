<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-04-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Tissue Processing: Role of Secondary Sterilization Techniques</TITLE><BODY>Secondary sterilization of musculoskeletal allografts may use chemicals, radiation, or combinations of these. No sterilization techniques have been definitively proven to be more effective than others, and their biomechanical and biological effects on allograft tissue remain largely unknown. The current risk of an allograft infection appears to be much less than the risk of infection surrounding the surgical procedure itself. With appropriate donor screening, improved donor testing—including nucleic acid testing (NAT), and adherence to AATB standards—the risk of disease transmission or infections can be eliminated or substantially decreased.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
