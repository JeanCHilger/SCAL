The CSF of these animals revealed immune reactions which were directed against coronavirus and other, unknown, antigens. In general, no direct correlation between the disease, the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), intrathecal synthesis of Ig and the presence of virus-specific antibodies was detectable, suggesting that the humoral, in contrast to the cellular, immune response does not play a significant pathogenetic role in this CNS disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
