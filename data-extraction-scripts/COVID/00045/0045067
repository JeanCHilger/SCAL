<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-07-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Tratamiento rehabilitador en la miositis aguda benigna infantil</TITLE><BODY>Benign acute childhood myositis (BACM) is a rare, temporary and self-limited condition, affecting school-age children (generally boys) after upper respiratory infection. It is characterized by sudden onset of severe pain in the legs and difficulty or inability to walk, with increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. We present the case of an 8-year-old girl with BACM and describe the clinical picture, keys for the differential diagnosis with other more serious disorders that associate inability to walk. We evaluate the benefits of rehabilitation treatment in the atypical or complicated cases in order to provide the solution to the condition and avoid complications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
