<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Synthesis of benzopolycyclic cage amines: NMDA receptor antagonist, trypanocidal and antiviral activities</TITLE><BODY>The synthesis of several 6,7,8,9,10,11-hexahydro-9-methyl-5,7:9,11-dimethano-5H-benzocyclononen-7-amines is reported. Several of them display low micromolar NMDA receptor antagonist and/or trypanocidal activities. Two compounds are endowed with micromolar anti vesicular stomatitis virus activity, while only one compound shows micromolar anti-influenza activity. The anti-influenza activity of this compound does not seem to be mediated by blocking of the M2 protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
