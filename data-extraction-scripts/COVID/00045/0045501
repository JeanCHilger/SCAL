<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1981-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Analysis and localisation of mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) polypeptides</TITLE><BODY>Summary The analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified mouse hepatitis virus type 3 revealed the presence of five polypeptides, three of them contained carbohydrate. The molecular weight of these proteins was 190,000 daltons (VGP100), 100,000 (VGP100), 58,000 (VP58), 25,000 (VP25) and 24,000 (VGP24). The analysis of particles obtained after limited proteolysis with bromelain suggests that VGP190 and VGP100 form the spike layer, that VP25 and VGP24 are membrane-associated and that VP58 represents the inner core polypeptide.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
