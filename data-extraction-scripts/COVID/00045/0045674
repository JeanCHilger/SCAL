It is produced at sites of infection and inflammation by both structural and inflammatory cells. However its role in allergen-induced inflammation remains to be tested. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of PTX3 deletion on ovalbumin (OVA)–induced allergic inflammation in a murine model of asthma. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from severe asthmatic and healthy subjects and level of PTX3 was determined by ELISA. PTX3(+/+) and PTX3(−/−) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and BALF and the lungs were collected for accessing inflammation. Lung tissue inflammation and mucus production were assessed by flow cytometry, H&E and PAS staining, respectively. FlexiVENT was used to determine airway resistance to methacholine of these mice. RESULTS: Here we report that severe asthmatics and OVA-sensitized/ challenged mice had increased PTX3 level in the lungs compared with healthy controls. Mice lacking PTX3 develop exaggerated neutrophilic/ eosinophilic lung inflammation, mucus production and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in an experimental model of OVA-induced asthma. Furthermore, OVA-exposed lung PTX3(−/−) CD4 T cells exhibit an increased production of IL-17A, an effect that is accompanied with an elevated STAT3 phosphorylation, reduced IL-2 production, enhanced activation and survival. Also we observed increase in IL-6 and IL-23 producing DCs in OVA-exposed PTX3(−/−) mice as compared to their wild type controls. CONCLUSION: Altogether, PTX3 deficiency results in augmented AHR, mucus production and IL-17A-dominant pulmonary inflammation, suggesting a regulatory role of PTX3 in the development of allergic inflammation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
