<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-03</DATELINE><TITLE>La BPCO : une maladie qui commence pr√©cocement</TITLE><BODY>This general review deals with the mechanisms which underlie the genetic factors in COPD. Many cellular and biochemical mechanisms occur in bronchial inflammation. We present the experimental models of COPD, insisting on the importance of oxydative stress, and on recent knowledge about the lung microbiome. Starting from this pathophysiology basis, we show how various genetic targets are able to interfere with the disease model. Thanks to these genetic targets, new markers in exhaled breath condensates and new drug targets are rising.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
