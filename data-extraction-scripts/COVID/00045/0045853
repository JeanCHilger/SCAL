However, the pyrazole/pyrazoline–thiazolidine-based hybrids as biologically active compounds is poorly discussed in the context of pharmacophore hybrid approach. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the data about the synthesis and modification of heterocyclic systems with thiazolidine and pyrazoline or pyrazole fragments in molecules as promising objects of modern bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. The description of biological activity was focused on SAR analysis and mechanistic insights of mentioned hybrids.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
