By means of a real-time PCR assay, CPV DNA was detected in all tissues examined, with the highest titres observed in the lymphoid tissue and the lowest loads in the urinary tract. Surprisingly, the nervous tissue was found to contain considerable amounts of CPV nucleic acid. Similar patterns of tissue distribution were observed in all the examined dogs irrespective of the antigenic variant causing the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
