<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 13 Viral Disease</TITLE><BODY>Abstract This chapter discusses infections of rats with viruses in the following 14 virus families: Adenoviridae, Arenaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hantaviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Pneumoviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, and Reoviridae. Serological surveys indicate that parvoviruses, coronaviruses, cardioviruses, and pneumoviruses are the most prevalent in laboratory rats. A new polyomavirus and a new cardiovirus that cause disease in laboratory rats are described. Metagenomic analyses of feces or intestinal contents from wild rats have detected viruses from an additional nine virus families that could potentially cause infections in laboratory rats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
