No laboratory animal model is yet been developed in porcine coronaviruses study. Here, we report that development of a transgenic mouse model expressing porcine APN which is susceptible to porcine coronavirus infection. The porcine APN transgene was constructed by fusing with mouse proximal APN promoter at 5′ terminus and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site at its 3′ terminus. After screen on pubs from the microinjected mice, we confirmed two transgenic lines expressing porcine APN in various organs. We confirmed the susceptibility to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, one of the porcine coronaviruses. These transgenic mice will be an important tool for research into the porcine coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
