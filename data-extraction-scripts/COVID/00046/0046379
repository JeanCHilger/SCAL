Currently, the rate of outbreak of emerging viruses is increasing and therefore the development and establishment of analytical methods for such viral infections are becoming more important. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a fast, multicomponent assay that enables non-invasive, non-destructive analysis. Recently, the diagnosis of viral infections using NIR spectroscopy has been attempted. In this review, the potential of the NIR method in the medical and virological fields is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
