Structural studies showed that these derivatives represent a series of rare methylsulfinyladenosine derivatives of interconvertible transesterification isomers and/or sulfinyl epimers. The antiviral activities of these rare nucleosides were evaluated against a series of human pathogenic viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
