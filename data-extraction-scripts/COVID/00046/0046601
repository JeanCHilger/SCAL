<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>CHLAMYDIA PERSISTENCE â€“ A TOOL TO DISSECT CHLAMYDIA-HOST INTERACTIONS</TITLE><BODY>Under stress, chlamydiae can enter a non-infectious but viable state termed persistence. In the absence of a tractable genetic system, persistence induction provides an important experimental tool with which to study these fascinating organisms. This review will discuss examples of: i) persistence studies that have illuminated critical chlamydiae/host interactions; and ii) novel persistence models that will do so in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
