We report severe T. foetus infection of the colon, cecum and ileum with concurrent feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) in a 3-month-old Bengal kitten with an 8-day history of vomiting, diarrhoea, failure to thrive and coughing. Protozoa filling the lumen and crypts and occasional invading into lamina propria were identified within the affected colon and confirmed by PCR as T. foetus ‘feline genotype’. Assessment of faeces by PCR revealed concurrent infection with FCoV and FPV. It is possible that immunosuppression by FPV played a role in the unprecedented T. foetus infection intensity observed histologically. Studies during and after resolution of FPV infection, will be critical to determine if T. foetus co-infection affects long-term prognosis of FPV survivors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
