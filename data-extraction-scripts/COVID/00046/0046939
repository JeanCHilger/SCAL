The key step of the synthesis is the optimized oxidation of the 3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl (HPMP) analogues to the corresponding 2â€²-carboxy-PME (CPME) derivatives using the TEMPO/NaClO(2)/NaClO oxidizing system. Although (S)-3-(adenin-9-yl)-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propanoic acid ((S)-CPMEA) has been designed as a compound with potential anti-HIV activity, none of the newly prepared CPME analogues exhibited any antiviral activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
