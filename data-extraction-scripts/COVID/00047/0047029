<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 7 Indoor Environmental Quality</TITLE><BODY>This chapter discusses the causes of indoor pollution as well as the rise of building-related illness (BRI) and sick building syndrome (SBS). Indoor air quality (IAQ) is discussed in detail including the factors that impact it such as inorganic contaminants including asbestos, radon and lead and the health hazards they present and testing methods for their presence. Combustion-generated contaminates such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides, tobacco smoke, and carbon dioxide (CO2) are analyzed, as are organic contaminants—aldehydes, VOCs/SVOCs, pesticides, formaldehyde (HCHO)—and the potential health hazards they present. Biological pollutants and the hazards they present are also discussed. Likewise, the impact of rodents, insect, and animal allergens on public health are explained and the steps that can be taken to reduce pollutant exposure. The attributes of thermal and visual comfort, noise pollution, and daylighting (including daylight factor) and their importance are examined. Lastly, the importance of ventilation, filtration, and the impact of pollution emitted by building materials on the indoor air quality are discussed as well as best practices to improve indoor air quality. Leading relevant organizations and codes are cited.
