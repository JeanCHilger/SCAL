The present study demonstrates that incorporation of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) into exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) enhances their uptake and induces the maturation of dendritic cells. Targeting of VSV-G and ovalbumin as a model antigen to the same ELVs increased the cross-presentation of ovalbumin via an endosomal acidification mechanism. Immunization of mice with VSV-G and ovalbumin containing ELVs led to an increased IgG2a antibody response, expansion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells, strong in vivo CTL responses, and protection from challenge with ovalbumin expressing tumor cells. Thus, incorporation of VSV-G and targeting of antigens to ELVs are attractive strategies to improve exosomal vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
