<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-03-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The Taking of the Cytoskeleton One Two Three: How Viruses Utilize the Cytoskeleton During Egress</TITLE><BODY>The final assembly of nonlytic envelope viruses requires the coordinated transport of either subviral particles or fully formed virions to the plasma membrane for release from the cell. Recent research has delved into the mechanisms viruses employ to hijack the host cellâ€™s cytoskeletal system for active transport to the site of final assembly and release. This review will look at recent findings that relate to the transport of virions to the cell periphery and out of the cell.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
