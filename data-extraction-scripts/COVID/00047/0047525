Based on those complex structures, we conduct computational characterization and design of RBD-mediated receptor recognition and antibody neutralization. The comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidences validate our structural bioinformatics protocols. And the calculations predict a number of single substitutions on RBD, receptor or antibody that could remarkably elevate the binding affinities of those complexes. It is reasonable to anticipate our structure-based computation-derived hypotheses could be informative to the future biochemical and immunological tests.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
