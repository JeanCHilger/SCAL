We determined the kinetics of antibody (IgG and IgM) and neutralizing antibodies against MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in this case before discharge. Moreover, no seroconversion was found among 53 close contacts by anti-MERS IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of paired serum samples. These findings suggest that neither community nor nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV occurred in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
