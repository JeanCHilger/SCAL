<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-11-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Severe acute respiratory syndrome in a hemodialysis patient</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infective disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus. We described the clinical course of the first long-term hemodialysis patient who developed SARS in the literature, and our experience in performing hemodialysis for this patient. Such patients may present with a less typical clinical picture, making diagnosis difficult. In this patient, the course of disease and duration of viral shedding was apparently prolonged, thus highlighting the need for increased infection control. Despite worsening the anemia in renal failure patients by causing hemolysis, ribavirin is well tolerated after dosage adjustment. Difficulties of diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of SARS in renal failure patients are discussed in this report.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
