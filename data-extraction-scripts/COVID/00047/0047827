Based on this representation, we consider some mathematical invariants and construct two 16-component vectors associated with these invariants. The vectors are used to characterize and compare the complete coding sequence part of beta globin gene of nine different species. The examination of similarities/dissimilarities illustrates the utility of the approach.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
