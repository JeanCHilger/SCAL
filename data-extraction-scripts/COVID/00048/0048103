The first section covers idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and its subtypes: peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The second section covers pulmonary toxicities of chemotherapies and immunosuppressive agents used in this setting. The final section covers less common syndromes, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary cytolytic thrombi, pulmonary venoocclusive disease, and transfusion-related acute lung injury.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
