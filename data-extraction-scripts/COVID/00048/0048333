MBL deficiency is common. More than 10% of the general population may, depending on definition, be classified as MBL deficient, underlining the redundancy of the immune system. Ongoing research attempt to illuminate at which conditions MBL deficiency may lead to disease. With examples, this review illustrates the diversity of results obtained so far.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
