T cells can serve a variety of functions as part of the host immune response during CNS viral infection. They can participate directly in viral clearance from the brain, or they can promote the survival of the host without exerting any direct effect on virus replication. Only a small number of T cells infiltrate the brain under normal circumstances. This paucity of immune surveillance of baseline is one of several reasons why the CNS has often been characterized as an “immunologically privileged” site. T cell-mediated lysis of infected cells has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism of viral clearance from tissues other than the CNS. In several well-characterized animal models of CNS viral infection, part of the elicited T cell response actually contributes to the pathology and adverse outcome of disease. Neurotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection of adult mice is the premier example of this phenomenon.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
