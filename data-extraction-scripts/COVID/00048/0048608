<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Fever in Returned Travelers</TITLE><BODY>Predominant causes of fever vary by different geographic areas of exposure. Malaria is the most common overall cause of systemic febrile illness in travelers returning from tropical areas; dengue is the most common cause in travelers to some regions. The approach to a febrile patient must consider travel and exposure history, incubation period, mode of exposure, and impact of pretravel vaccination. Initial symptoms of self-limited and life-threatening infections may be similar; focal signs and symptoms can help to limit the differential diagnosis. Routine laboratory results can provide clues to the final diagnosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
