Labeling with soluble ligands enables rapid and quantitative analysis of yeast-displayed libraries by flow cytometry, while libraries with insoluble or even as-yet-uncharacterized binding targets can be screened through cell-surface selections. In parallel, the utilization of yeast surface display for protein characterization, including in particular the mapping of functional epitopes mediating protein-protein interactions, represents a significant recent advance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
