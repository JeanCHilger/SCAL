<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-01-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Groundwater Pollution</TITLE><BODY>This chapter starts with the presentation of the history of one of the most natural disaster caused by groundwater pollution (Love Canal). The derivation of the mathematical model describing the transport of pollution via groundwater is presented in detail with the derivation of the exact solution. Statistical techniques for sensitivity and uncertainties analysis of parameters associated to the transport model are presented. Some techniques for groundwater remediation are listed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
