They were screened for the DNA affinity by the ethidium bromide displacement assay. It was shown that the lg K(a) values of the compounds containing tetracyclic benzoimidazo[1,2-c]quinazoline fragment are approximately one order magnitude greater than those of the corresponding acyclic phenylbenzoimidazole derivatives.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
