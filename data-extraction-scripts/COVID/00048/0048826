STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed clinical history, diagnostic studies, explant histology, genetic results, and post-transplant course for 6 infants with atypical ACDMPV who underwent bilateral lung transplantation at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. We compared their histology with infants with classic ACDMPV and compared their outcomes with infants transplanted for other indications. RESULTS: In contrast to neonates with classic ACDPMV who present with severe hypoxemia and refractory pulmonary hypertension within hours of birth, none of the infants with atypical ACDMPV presented with progressive neonatal respiratory failure. Three infants had mild neonatal respiratory distress and received nasal cannula oxygen. Three other infants had no respiratory symptoms at birth and presented with hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension at 2–3 months of age. Bilateral lung transplantation was performed at 4–20 months. Unlike in classic ACDMPV, histopathologic findings were not uniformly distributed and were not diffuse. Three subjects had apparent non-mosaic genetic defects involving FOXF1. Two infants had extra-pulmonary anomalies (posterior urethral valves, inguinal hernia). Three transplanted children are alive at 5–16 years, similar to outcomes for infants transplanted for other indications. Lung explants from infants with atypical ACDMPV demonstrated diagnostic but nonuniform histopathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: One and 5-year survival rates for infants with atypical ACDM are similar to infants transplanted for other indications. Given the clinical and histopathologic spectra, ACDMPV should be considered in infants with hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension, even beyond the newborn period.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
