The objectives of this study were to evaluate student compliance and opinions on preventive measures of a university before and during an H1N1 influenza pandemic, and to explore environmental and behavioural factors that might contribute towards compliance. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire. METHODS: Local and foreign students attending an international summer school programme were invited to participate in a self-administered survey. RESULTS: Respondents complied with most of the preventive measures, excluding website viewing and mask wearing. Significant differences in compliance and perceived necessity were found amongst students from Singapore, Hong Kong and the USA. Singaporean students were significantly more likely to comply with all measures and consume antiviral medication in response to the pandemic than students studying in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Studentsâ€™ responses towards university pandemic measures were largely positive, but sensitivity towards these measures varied between groups by country of study. This should be considered in further comparative studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
