Targeting signals have been identified in three glycosyltransferases, a viral envelope protein and several proteins of the trans-Golgi network. Interestingly, the targeting signals for membrane proteins of the Golgi stacks seem to be contained in transmembrane domains. Information in the cytoplasmic tails is required for the targeting of trans-Golgi network proteins. Mechanisms involving both retention and retrieval have been invoked.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
