<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Tools for Model Building and Optimization into Near-Atomic Resolution Electron Cryo-Microscopy Density Maps</TITLE><BODY>Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) has advanced dramatically to become a viable tool for high-resolution structural biology research. The ultimate outcome of a cryoEM study is an atomic model of a macromolecule or its complex with interacting partners. This chapter describes a variety of algorithms and software to build a de novo model based on the cryoEM 3D density map, to optimize the model with the best stereochemistry restraints and finally to validate the model with proper protocols. The full process of atomic structure determination from a cryoEM map is described. The tools outlined in this chapter should prove extremely valuable in revealing atomic interactions guided by cryoEM data.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
