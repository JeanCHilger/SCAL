With an emphasis on the metal-ligand dissociation as the rate-determining step the present review summarizes not only spectacular examples of machinery, but also highlights rate data collected during a variety of investigations. Copper-ligand exchange reactions are mostly triggered by redox processes, addition of metal ions or addition of ligands. While the rate data spread over >8 orders of magnitude, individual effects of solvent, steric bulk, flexibility, Ïƒ-basicity and the trajectory (intra- vs. intermolecular dissociation) have large impact. Unfortunately, in many cases the exact mechanism in the rate-determining step (nucleophile-induced vs. monomolecular metal-ligand dissociation) has not been determined, suggesting to invest further efforts in the physical (in)organic chemistry of such coordination-driven systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
