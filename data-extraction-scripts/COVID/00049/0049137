Synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The results indicated that, compounds 5c and 5i exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity. Compound 5f was found to be the most potent antifungal agent. The structure activity relationship revealed that the presence of electron withdrawing groups at para position of phenyl ring remarkably enhanced the antibacterial activity of synthesized compounds. Further, the results of preliminary MTT cytotoxicity studies on HeLa cells suggested that potent antimicrobial activity of 5b, 5c, 5f, 5h and 5i is accompanied by low cytotoxicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
