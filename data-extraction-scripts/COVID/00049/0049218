DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Ocular fluids from 139 patients suspected of infectious uveitis, but negative for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii by polymerase chain reaction and/or antibody analysis in intraocular fluids, were assessed for the presence of 18 viruses and 3 bacteria by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The ocular fluids from 48 patients with uveitis of known etiology or with cataract were included as controls. RESULTS: Positive PCR results were found for Epstein-Barr virus, for rubella virus, and for human herpesvirus 6 each in 1 patient and for human parechovirus in 4 patients. Of the human parechovirusâ€“positive patients, 1 was immunocompromised and had panuveitis. The other 3 patients were immunocompetent and had anterior uveitis, all with corneal involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Human parechovirus might be associated with infectious (kerato)uveitis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
