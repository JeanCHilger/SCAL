<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Offline: A dangerous virus, but not the one you think</TITLE><BODY>Perspective. It's in short supply these days. Coronavirus has saturated the attention of politicians, policy makers, journalists, and even medical journal editors for several months now. There seems to be no end in sight. But while we wrestle with the difference between containment and delay, prospects for a vaccine, and the mental state of an American President who wilfully ignores the advice of his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we should not forget the threat posed by other viruses. We should especially not forget HIV. There have been around 100 000 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection worldwide. Yet please don’t neglect the fact that 38 million people globally are living with HIV, including 1·7 million children under 15 years. 1·7 million people are newly infected with HIV annually. 6000 women aged 15–24 years are infected every week. Coronavirus is reported to have killed fewer than 4000 people so far. Meanwhile, 770 000 people die every year from AIDS-related illnesses. We should certainly take coronavirus very seriously indeed. But we must also put this new pandemic in perspective. So far, we have not.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
