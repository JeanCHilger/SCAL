Herein we present the synthesis for a series of N1-alkylated uracil derivatives bearing Ï‰-(2-benzyl- and 2-benzoylphenoxy)alkyl substituents as novel NNRTIs. These compounds displayed anti-HIV activity similar to that of nevirapine and several of them exhibited activity against the K103N/Y181C RT mutant HIV-1 strain. Further evaluation revealed that the inhibitors were active against most nevirapine-resistant mono- and di-substituted RTs with the exception of the V106A RT. Thus, the candidate compounds can be regarded as potential lead compounds against the wild-type virus and drug-resistant forms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
