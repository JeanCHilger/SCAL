Their structures were fully characterized by spectroscopic analyses in combination with chemical derivatization. Compounds 1–3, and 6 were evaluated for their antiviral activity against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
