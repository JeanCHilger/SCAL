Resistant mice (CD-1), when similarly inoculated, only develop the early phase of the disease. Blood–retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown occurs in the early phase in both strains, coincident with the onset of inflammation. As the inflammation subsides, the extent of retinal vascular leakage is decreased, indicating that BRB breakdown in experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR) is primarily due to inflammation rather than to retinal cell destruction. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is upregulated only in susceptible mice during the secondary (retinal degeneration) phase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
