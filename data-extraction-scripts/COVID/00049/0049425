One such technique, referred to as activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), uses active site-directed probes to monitor the functional state of enzymes, taking into account post-translational interactions and modifications. ABPP gives insight into the catalytic activity of enzyme families that does not necessarily correlate with protein abundance. ABPP has been used to investigate several viruses and their interactions with their hosts. Differential enzymatic activity induced by viruses has been monitored using ABPP. In this review, we present recent advances and trends involving the use of ABPP methods in understanding host–virus interactions and in identifying novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
