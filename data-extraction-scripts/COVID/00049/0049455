<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-12-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Infection preventionists' experience during the first months of the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza A pandemic</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: A novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) was identified in April 2009 and developed into a pandemic by June 2009. This rapid and unexpected event had enormous implications for infection preventionists (IP) internationally. Lessons learned from this event should guide future pandemic planning efforts. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted at the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, (APIC) 2009 conference to evaluate IPs' experience with the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic and assess their perceived needs related to novel H1N1 topics and products required for future education and reference materials. RESULTS: Forty IPs (37 from the United States and 3 international) participated in the focus groups. Needed reference materials identified by attendees included infection prevention guidance for nonacute care settings; occupational health polices; and brief, multilanguage patient/family educational materials. Educational topics on which IPs need to be trained include isolation precautions/personal protective equipment recommendations for novel H1N1 patients, coordination between hospitals and community response agencies, and surge management. The rapidly changing and conflicting recommendations related to patient management made responding to this event challenging. IPs require synthesized infection prevention guidelines developed in a concise, real-time format. CONCLUSION: IPs must continue to partner with public health and other response agencies to address gaps in pandemic planning.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
