This chemoselective formation of 2-fluoroaziridines was achieved by using CH(3)CN as a solvent. Interestingly, the reaction proceeded without activation of zinc metal, which was necessary for the Reformatsky reaction of bromodifluoroacetate. None of α-bromo-α-fluoro-β-lactams, four-membered cyclization products, and noncyclized 3-amino-2-bromo-2-fluorocarboxylic esters, usual Reformatsky adducts, were formed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
