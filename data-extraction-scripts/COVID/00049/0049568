<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-12-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 7 IFN Inducibility of Major Histocompatibility Antigens in Tumors</TITLE><BODY>Interferons represent a protein family with pleiotropic functions including immunomodulatory, cytostatic, and cytotoxic activities. Based on these effects, interferons are involved in innate as well as adaptive immunity, thereby shaping the tumor host immune responses. These cytokines, alone or in combination, have been successfully implemented for the treatment of some malignancies. However, it has been recently demonstrated that tumor cells could be resistant to interferon treatment, which may be associated with an escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to summarize the frequency of impaired interferon signal transduction, their underlying molecular mechanisms, and their clinical relevance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
