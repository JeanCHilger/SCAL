Therefore, clarifying the expression and function of these important molecules in bone endocrine physiology and pathology is of great significance for improving their potential therapeutic value for metabolism-associated bone diseases. In the present review, we highlight the recent advances made in understanding the function and molecular mechanism of these small non-coding RNAs in bone metabolism, especially their potentially therapeutic values in bone-related diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
