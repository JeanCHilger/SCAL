One of them, was chosen as diagnostic reagent: it showed high ELISA reactivity with all the bovine, human and porcine rotavirus strains tested and reacted with VP6, structural protein product known to support the common rotavirus antigen. A sandwich ELISA procedure using the chosen monoclonal as “capture and detecting” antibody was performed to detect rotavirus in faecal samples from experimentally inoculated newborn calves: it always gave a negative response with meconium and a positive response for the stool specimens which rotavirus have been isolated. This assay was compared with Enzygnost and Slidex Rota Kit tests and with a non-commercial sandwich ELISA test using polyclonal antibodies: it showed more sensitivity than the agglutination test and was as sensitive as the other two tests to detect rotavirus in routine diagnostic material. The test evaluated showed no equivocal results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
