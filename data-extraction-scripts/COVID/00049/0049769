Since it has been suggested that the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV may have been acquired from a group 1 coronavirus, we conducted a surveillance study and identified bat-SARS-CoV and bat-CoV HKU2 in 8.7% and 7.5% respectively of R. sinicus in Hong Kong and Guangdong. Complete genome sequencing of four strains of bat-CoV HKU2 revealed the smallest coronavirus genome (27164 nucleotides) and a unique spike protein evolutionarily distinct from the rest of the genome. This spike protein, sharing similar deletions with other group 2 coronaviruses in its C-terminus, also contained a 15-amino acid peptide homologous to a corresponding peptide within the RBM of spike protein of SARS-CoV, which was absent in other coronaviruses except bat-SARS-CoV. These suggest a common evolutionary origin in the spike protein of bat-CoV HKU2, bat-SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
