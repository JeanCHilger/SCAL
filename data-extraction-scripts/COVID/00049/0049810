It remains unclear, however, which children with severe bronchiolitis (e.g., an episode requiring hospitalization) will develop recurrent wheezing and/or asthma. Although many environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the pathway from bronchiolitis to asthma, this review focuses on the viruses that have been linked to bronchiolitis and how these viruses may predict or contribute to future wheezing and asthma. The review also discusses vitamin D as an emerging risk factor for respiratory infections and wheezing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
