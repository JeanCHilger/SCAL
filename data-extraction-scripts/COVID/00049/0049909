The group 1 pigs were low antibody-response phenotypes (SLAa/a, SLAa/c, SLAc/c), and the group 2 pigs were high antibody-response phenotypes (SLAd/d, SLAd/g, SLAg/g). Six hours after induction the antiviral titres were not influenced by the SLA group, but higher titres were observed in females. Higher antiviral titres were found in group 2 pigs before treatment and 24 hours after treatment, and higher titres were found in female pigs. The antiviral titres before and after treatment were also influenced by the sire. Group 2 pigs had lower total leucocyte counts before treatment, and there was a significant reduction in leucocyte numbers in both groups six hours after induction, due mainly to a large reduction in lymphocyte counts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
