Informe SESPAS 2010</TITLE><BODY>A cost-effective and equitable health policy design involves tackling social determinants of health and becoming aware of the impact of non-healthcare policies. Structural changes in institutional organization, targeted to create a new space for network governance, are required. Some factors tend to delay this process, such as institutional inertia, poor coordination and cooperation mechanisms among sectors, levels of government and agents, the consolidation of the biomedical paradigm reinforced by lobbies and cultural patterns, and inadequate collaboration among experts, practitioners and health authorities. However, these factors may be counterbalanced by political will and by the knowledge provided by domestic and foreign experiences. The present situation arising from the recent public health crises, and particularly from the current economic depression, offers a major chance to introduce the needed changes in health oriented actions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
