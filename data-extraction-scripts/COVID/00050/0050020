The core of our method is a new measure of pairwise distances among sequences. Using the primitive discrimination substrings of sequence S and Q, a discrimination measure DM(S, Q) is defined for the similarity analysis of them. The proposed method does not require multiple alignments and is fully automatic. To illustrate its utility, we construct phylogenetic trees on two independent data sets. The results indicate that the method is efficient and powerful.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
