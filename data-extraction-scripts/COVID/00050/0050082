Despite important advances in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, The primary causes of AD remain elusive, accurate biomarkers are not well characterized, and available pharmacological treatments are not cost-effective. As a complex disorder, AD is polygenic and multifactorial: hundreds of defective genes distributed across the human genome may contribute to its pathogenesis (with the participation of diverse environmental factors, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and epigenetic phenomena) and lead to amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and premature neuronal death. Future perspectives for the global management of AD predict that structural and functional genomics and proteomics may help in the search for reliable biomarkers, and that pharmacogenomics may be an option in optimizing drug development and therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
