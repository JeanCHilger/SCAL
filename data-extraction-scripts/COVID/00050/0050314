<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-01-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Pattern of early human-to-human transmission of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), December 2019 to January 2020</TITLE><BODY>Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia. We estimated the basic reproduction number R(0) of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4â€“3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
