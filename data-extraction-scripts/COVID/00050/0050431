<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1987-05-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Bovine interferon: Its biology and application in veterinary medicine</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Investigations of the production and potential use of bovine interferons against viral infections have occurred since the first descriptions of interferons in other systems. The recent advent of recombinant DNA-technology has facilitated such studies and furthered our knowledge about the bovine interferon system in general. This review gives an overview of the biology, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of bovine interferons. Areas in which the interferons are now applied or have potential application in viral diseases in cattle are described. Finally, the value of studies of the bovine interferon system with respect to comparative interferon research is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
