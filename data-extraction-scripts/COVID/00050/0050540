Etiotropic drugs cannot effectively control infectious diseases therefore, there is a dire need to explore alternative strategies especially those based on the regulation of immune system. The review discusses all rational approaches to develop better understanding towards immunotherapeutic strategies based on modulation of immune system in an attempt to curb the elevating risk of infectious diseases such as HIV, HPV and HSV because of their high prevalence. Development of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and several other immune based treatments are promising alternative strategies that are offering new opportunities to eradicate pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
