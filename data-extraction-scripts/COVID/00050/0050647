It was shown that pH adjustment to 2 was essential for processing of the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Linearity between time of incubation and ACTH production was shown. The existence of specific endopeptidases in lymphocytes for processing of the POMC molecule remains doubtful.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
