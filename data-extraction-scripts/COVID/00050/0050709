Studies were conducted to understand ORO entry in HeLa cells. Chlorpromazine inhibited early steps of ORO replication cycle, consistent with entry/uncoating. The data indicate that ORO enters HeLa cells by clathrin-coated vesicles, by a mechanism susceptible to endosomal acidification inhibitors. Transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence indicated that ORO associates with clathrin-coated pits and can be found in association with late endosomes in a time shorter than 1h.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
