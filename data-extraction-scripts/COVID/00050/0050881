Previous studies have determined that podocytes possess a local RAS that can generate angiotensin II. Podocytes have also been shown to express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can decrease angiotensin II levels by generation of angiotensin-(1–7). Nadarajah et al. now show that increased podocyte ACE2 activity can attenuate the development of diabetic nephropathy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
