CD8+DimerX-S1203+ CTLs were detected in the PBMC from these donors up to 3 months after recovery. The percentages of CD8+DimerX-S1203+ cells paralleled the numbers of interferon-Î³-positive spots in an ELISPOT assay using the same antigenic peptide. In conclusion, DimerX-based flow cytometry staining may prove to be a real-time method to screen for CTL directed at epitopes from a newly identified virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
